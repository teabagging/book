Here's the situation:Very little is actually known about what happened during Henry VIII's reign; it was then treason to speak against the King and also the world had not quite developed it's achival talents in 1536. What Ms. Gregory's novel does is study a wealth of research by other authors and spins a possible story from what little we know of this point in history. There is fiction sprinkled in to fill the gaps of course - otherwise you have non-fiction. That's the \\"fiction\\" part of Historical Fiction.We don't even know for sure if Mary was the elder or younger sister to Anne. Historians disagree on that fact and put her birth anywhere from 1500-1507. This book chooses a position that she is a year younger than Anne.What has been documented in history is followed closely here. Dates and times, locations, etc. The rest is a enjoyable, plausable story.The book was a great read and was easy to follow. I prefered \\"The Queen's Fool\\" to this one however, perhaps because it was my first of Phillipa Gregory's."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Fast-paced, dramatic, and with an entriguing look into the culture of the court of King Henry VIII, this book is a great read. The apparent factual inaccuracies noted by other readers takes something away from it, as I think it shows a lack of respect for the history. However the story is fascinating and most of the characters wonderfully textured (I don't agree with some that they were one-dimensional: Henry was a powerful goof, George lovably ambitious & loyal and Anne was my favourite of all; so powerful and sarcastic! She was more of a heroine than Mary for me. I wanted to be her lady in waiting!). You won't want to put this novel down. Like Henry, the Boleyns snared me too! 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have heard a lot of people grumble about the inaccuracies in this book, but you have to remember when you read it - it it FICTION. The book follows the life of Mary Boleyn, older sister and consort to King Henry VIII. The events in this book are accurate, but the book is told from the viewpoint of Mary herself and nobody can be certain how she really felt about her lot in life as a pawn in her families quest for power. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading additional novels by Ms. Gregory."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My friend at work had read this book and loved it so I read it even though I didn't like Queens Fool. I'm real glad I did because this book was absolutely wonderful! I've always been interested in history but I find historical fictions hard to read because they are either too overloaded with facts or are so completely modernized that you almost forget that you are reading a historical fiction. This novel is a fast and easy read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Once again, as with \\"The Queen's Fool\\", I was blown away with the amount of daily historical detail and the captivating storyline. By focusing on a character, Mary Boleyn, that doesn't have quite the historical presence as other individuals from that time period, the reader gets to know the other characters through Mary's naive eyes, therefore the reader gets a new perspective from which to view this historical era. It's a perspective that humanizes these individuals, and has added to my love of hisory.I really don't know what it is with Philippa Gregory, but she can truly tell a story that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was great. Once you start you can't stop! It has drama, romance, suspense, a little horror, and very interesting characters.

You will want to stay up until you can barely see to finish reading this incredible novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Based on a true story, this is perhaps the best historical novel I've read this year. Although long, this is a good sexy read, a real page-turner. Fine characterizations.Sisters are supposed to be best friends. But what happens when a man they both want gets between them and has them both? This is a convincing fictional re-telling of the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, told from the point-of-view of her sister Mary. It's a tale of power-seeking, ambitious scheming, seduction and love, and heads being put on the chopping block. This story of rivalry and intrigue makes history fun!David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I don't usually read historical fiction, but this book has inspired me to give the genre another try! It is like a romantic thriller but more fascinating because it is based on historical events. The book is hard to put down and I got very little else accomplished once I started it. It was a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience and I am recommending it to all of my friends."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a mesmerizing tale of the court of King Henry VIII and his illicit romances. Motivated by pride and greed, the Boleyn family is nearly destoyed by their wicked scheming and England is never the same. The illusions, terror and emotion of the characters is palpable.Philippa Gregory writes with sensual realism that whisks her readers away to this tortured--albeit lovely world. This book is enticing and exciting."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Someone in my book club picked this book and I thought I would hate it since I am usually not interested in anything historical. It's about 2 sisters in King Henry's court and these girls endure SO much. I must say, I could not put this book down! I loved all the twists and turns. It is a very long book but I got interested very quickly and that made it easy to read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I could NOT put this book down. The historical facts mixed with Philippa Gregory's imagination was amazing and completely believable. The characters were so lifelike. I definitely recommend the other book &quot;The Queen's Fool&quot; by the same author. It's a wonderful follow-up."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is definitely one of the books that I would want with me if I were stranded on a desert island! It's intelligent and deliciously scandelous at the same time. These legendary historical figures, that are so widely written about, come alive in this novel. Philippa Gregory has done a fastastic job of turning well known facts into fiction. She refreshes events that happened hundreds of years ago with Mary, the King's mistress and Anne Boleyn's sister, of which little is known. As with all stories that re-tell history, there are some parts of this novel that took me out of the story and made me wonder whether such and such had really happened. But decisions had to be made and, in my opinion, the author made the right ones. This book was impossible to put down but when it was finished, I found myself wanting more. If I could read one book for the rest of my life this would be it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you love English history as well as fiction, you will enjoy this book. Very well written with lots of twists and turns. Great story of life in the old English court. Couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What a story good to the last page !!! Philippa Gregory my favorite writer tells such a good story and considering it is history it is so lively with characters and conversation.

I'm also buying the book in hard bound for my daughter and I we collect them."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"An absolutely fabulous book about Henry VIII and the Boelyn family. Gregory is historically accurate in this story. If you have no frame of reference for this period in history, don't worry. She will fill you in with all the relevant facts. Most interesting was the place of women in society during this period - their limitations and expectations by all family members of origin and their husbands."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"We all know the story of Anne Boleyn, but this tory told by the sister, Mary, is so real and offers a different angle on the life of King Henry VIII and his women, that it is hard to put the book down.

Ladies, be glad we live in this day and age.You have to read this one."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have never read historical fiction so I borrowed The Other Boleyn Girl when it came recommended by a good friend. I was a little wary at first but, wow! You will not be able to put this down! Phillipa Gregory embraces Mary's character (the other Boleyn sister) and brings her to life. Gregory brings emotion and details to the story that are better than any prime time story line.I am very curious to read more from Gregory. If you are a frequent reader of historical fiction or Phillipa Gregory, I would love any recommendations. Please comment.The Other Boleyn Girl is a great book to curl up in bed with. You will be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A friend loaned this to me since she had absolutely loved it ..... and I have to say I'm sorry I don't have my own copy now to re-read !I usually enjoy good historical fiction (i.e. Margaret George) but can sometimes find the books a bit daunting due to the sheer number of pages and trying to fit reading in during the slots of time I have available. Since this was the second friend to tell me to read this, I decided to dig in and get started .... I am so glad I did.Since this has been so thoroughly reviewed, I won't go into detail around content, but I felt a need to add my voice - the book is truly wonderful. It is one of those books that even after several weeks, I find myself reflecting back on it and eagerly anticipating reading other works by this author. I tend to read a fair amount (about 100 books a year) in all genres and have to say this would have to be one of my top 10 this year.If you enjoy good writing, good stories and feeling like you have actually expanded you mind (even though it is fiction), take the time to read this .... it's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I saw this book a few times at the bookstore but never felt compelled to buy it. I eventually bought it based on the recommendation of a friend. Once I started reading it, I couldnt put it down. The story and writing draw you into several of the characters of the book. The book touches on love, family, competition... I did not want the book to end. This has been the best book I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book reminded me of a cross between a Danielle Steele novel and a Harlequin romance. I didn't want to like it, but must admit I did. I am not sure how historically accurate it is, but I AM sure that it is entertaining. Seduction, innocence, dark secrets, chastity, evilness and even incest all in one book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I LOVED this book. My taste in books is sometimes eclectic, but everyone in my circle enjoyed it very much as well, and six twenty-somethings with different backgrounds coming to an agreement on literature is quite a rare occurrence.As with other books in this genre, there is the danger that key events and historical facts may be glossed over or romanticized, but the author avoids this trap and presents everything very accurately as it unfolds. Although Mary Boleyn was never really an important or influential woman in an historical sense, she serves as the narrator for this book, giving the reader a compelling look into the court of Henry VIII. It is interesting that Anne, who had a role of much greater importance both in the story and in history, was not chosen to serve as narrator, but this choice allows us to see her in a mostly unbiased way. Of course, given that Mary is both her sister and rival, she does not always present Anne in the best possible light.Certain plot aspects have been invented and others have been trumped up, but all in all, this is an extremely enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm a full blown anglophile and fairly picky reader of historical fiction. I found this to be an entertaining book and one of Gregory's better efforts. I can't wait for the movie version with Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman ... should be hot!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I don't usually read historical fiction, but a friend gave me a copy of this book and I couldn't put it down! In fact, I find a lot of fiction mediocre at best. I am tired of murder mysteries, don't like most of Oprah's bookclub picks (a few exceptions but...) and above all, love a good story. The last fiction book I enjoyed this much was probably Memoirs of a Geisha.I bought 8 copies today for friends and colleagues as holiday gifts. Obviously, I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Most fans of historical fiction are probably familiar with the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. His divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and the events leading to Anne's execution have been dramatised many times. But not much is known about Anne's younger sister Mary, who is known to have interested Henry well before these events.\\"The Other Boleyn GIrl\\" is told from Mary's point of view, and highlights the cut-throat atmosphere of the Tudor court. Once her family realise that Mary has caught the King's eye, they instruct her on every move, hoping that the king's affection will translate into positions, titles and power. And when Anne eventually fascinates Henry even more, they plainly discard Mary to back her more ambitious sister.But the book deals with Mary's feelings as well. We watch her grow from a girl who is married off at 13 to someone she barely knows, to a teenager smitten with the attentions of a powerful sovereign. Eventually she becomes a mother and finds love with a simple country man. But even so, her personal life is forever at the mercy of the changeable court, and so often she must drop her personal concerns to aid her family retain power, a job she doesn't relish.Since there is little historical fact known about Mary Boleyn (it isn't even sure when she was born), Philippa Gregory has chosen a protagonist who is involved with interesting actual events, but can be conveniently moulded to fit the form of fiction. So beware, not all you read about Mary and Anne may be strictly true. But the story is constructed so well, and the writing so entertaining, that I wasn't even concerned by the parts I knew weren't correct.This is good quality historical fiction which I recommend to any lover of the genre. Enough of the book is based on fact, so the educated reader doesn't feel duped, and the fictional parts blend seemlessly. Not to mention, they make this book a dramatic and entertaining read which I had trouble putting down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found this book to be wildly entertaining. I read it for my book club and while not a huge fan of historical fiction, I found that I could not put it down. I may actually buy the next two books..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"When I first began this book I had a difficult time relating to Henry VIII as a \\"romantic hero\\", and although I tried to take into account the time-period and presumed factual bones within the fiction, the image of a young Mary Boleyn being married off at the age of 12 and then encouraged (and willing) to engage in an affair with the king at the age of 14 was also something I found hard to reconcile. However, as the character of Mary matures and becomes more conflicted with the values of her ambitious family and the royal court, I became much more invested in her. Therefore, what was first disturbing, ultimately became an engrossing and satisfying piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I just finished The Other Boleyn Girl and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't usually go for historical fiction since history is usally dry and fiction is not meant to be taken as more than creative license. But Phillip Gregory has blended both mediums masterfully. I found using Mary as the narrator, the infamous Anne Boleyn's sister very clever since so much is historiclly documented about Anne and very little is actually known about Mary. We are told that Anne is older and was sent to be trained in the French court and that Mary is the younger sister being married at aged 12 and placed as Queen Katherine's lady in waiting. I have always found Anne Boleyn's tale fascinating.Gregory is not a historian, so if she erred somewhat on the order and dates of some of the demises of the famous clergy or wars, so be it. At times I forgot I was reading fiction I got so caught up in the political intrigue and the Howard family's lust for power at the expense of their own kin. Her portrayal of George Boleyn was very colorful though there is no way to know if the allegations of him being homosexual or whether he actually did engage in incest to help his sister Anne beget a son to save her posisiton are true. The sibling rivalry between Anne and mary plays true. Anne uses her sister so meanly in her asirations to become queen, yet Mary is still supportive of her sister to the very end as Anne falls from grace and is executed.We see Mary, who truly cares for the king being pushed by her family to keep the interest of the king for their selfish rise in power and then callously pushed aside by both the king and her family when neither have further use for her. While Anne is ruthless, and self serving, Mary matures and eventually develops the courage to take control of her life by marrying the man she loves and defying her overbearing family. I recommend this book this anyone who is drawn to this famous period of history and wants to see it \\"come alive\\" in print."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was definately worth my time...all 5 days of it...I could not put it down! I am interested in Elizabethan history, no matter how whimsical it may be..anyway, this is a very good book, from romance to treachery, it will keep your attention!I also recommend Ill Met by Moonlight, by Sarah A. Hoyt"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While the book itself was a very entertaining read, one should remember that this is historical fiction, the emphasis being on FICTION. I enjoyed the book greatly, the characters are all very interesting and the glimpse into the life of a courtier entertaining, but if you are looking for a book that will tell you what really happened to the Boleyn girls you'd best look elsewhere. The half third to quarter of the book is filled with major inaccuracies. That aside, it did serve to pique my interest in Anne Boleyn, her family, and her times as well as provide a few enjoyable hours of reading."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"&quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; is a truly fascinating historical fiction. If you think you know everything there is to know about the Boleyn's - think again. In this novel, George was right: Mary and George Boleyn were &quot;nobody's&quot; because their sister Anne over-shined the both. I did not know that Mary or George even existed, not to mention that Mary was King Henry's mistress or that he fathered two children with her, or how Anne caught the King's eye. My, how the history books leave out details. To sum this novel up: it wasn't about love, but power, and how much power was attainable, and how people would stop at nothing to get the power, castle, or title. Mary, George, and Anne were treated like human chess pieces. Anne checked-mate Queen Katherine and England went down hill from there. I was given the impression that if the Boleyn's hadn't shoved their way into the King's life, he wouldn't have considered divorcing Queen Katherine, and therefore divorce wouldn't be where it is today. The question and answer section with the author is a nice touch and the questions for the reader is a real thinker. I recommend."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is worth every one of it's 661 pages! I couldn't put it down or stop thinking about it. It was even in my dreams! Constant suspence and very well-rounded characters, plus plot, plot, plot! It will be hard to find another book that is such a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Even if you are familiar with the Anne Boleyn and Henery VIII saga you will find new intrigue with this captivating book. Written in first person from the prospective of Mary Boleyn who was intimate with the King years before her sister. This book tells Mary's story with is completely imeshed with her sister Anne's. The Boleyn family is portrayed in a less then golden light as the family attempts to weave themselves into court life and gain the advantage over the Seymours (ultimately failing). Anne and Mary are simply pawns in a sick and twisted game. Anne is very unlikable in this novel however, it's not clear as to rather she is more tragically a causality of her family and the times. Mary's hostility and love for her sister is as confusing and complex as any sibling relationship. I celebrate when Mary is able to find true love and break free of the family cycle... if we could all be as strong as Mary perhaps we too will live happily ever after. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For any lover of historical fact or fiction, or, as in this case, fact/fiction, this is an absolute MUST. Pretty, blonde and compliant Mary Boleyn, a minor member of the powerful Howard family of the Duke of Norfolk, is brought to the English court of Henry VIII after being brought up at the French court, as was the custom in those days. She becomes the mistress of Henry who has tired of his older wife, Katherine, who has, as yet, failed to produce a living male heir. Mary gives birth to a girl and then a boy in quick succession but is shortly after, supplanted in the King's affections by her scheming, seductive and ambitious sister, Anne, who is determined to become Queen. By this time, Mary is tired of Henry's petulance and foul temper and is pleased to step back and take second place. Anne's ambitions quickly go to her head and she proceeds to alienate the court and the general public with her uncontrollable rages and demands. With Mary as her lady-in-waiting and her brother George, a young man with homosexual tendencies and an unhealthy interest in his sisters, as her immediate circle, the birth of a daughter, Elizabeth, does nothing to favour her in the eyes of the King who is desperate for a son to succeed him. The remainder of this long novel is the tragic tale of the inevitable downfall of Anne who seems to rush towards her doom, pushed by her incredible pride and lack of concern for anyone else, even her family. Whether or not the personal details of her life, including the purported incest with her brother, are true, remains unproven but at least Mary does find a true love and it's an historical fact that she and her husband lived a happy life with their children and were greatly favoured by Elizabeth I, their half sister and cousin"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Going against Tudor historians, Gregory developed her own Da Vinci Code by writing a story that embraces the charges levelled at Queen Anne Boleyn. What if the charges were true? Anything is plausible. Gregory scores major points in just being able to write such a tomb of a novel, however, there are some choices made that are hard to swallow. Mary being the youngest of the Boleyn sisters is one, their ages for another. What happened to the part of the story where Mary was KICKED OUT of French Court for her promiscuity with King Francis I? She was closer to 18 than 12 at the time this story began. A small thing, but it's Anne Boleyn behavior in this book that was very hard for this reader to believe. Screaming at the King in front of his court. Are you kidding me? The last act is also a hard one to swallow. All historian agree that once Mary was banished from court, she never returned (and she went on to have a total of 14 children). Which is more feasible than Gregory's suggestion that the whole court would forget about Mary and not involve her in the intense interrogation scenes. At bare minium George's wife would have brought up her name. Still, this is an engaging read and do offer some ligit possibilities and this novel is definitely worth your time and money, but do not learn your history through fiction novels."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I could not put this one down. I would get mad that I had to go to bed, or go to work. I wanted to finish this book. It even led me to rent some National Geographic dvds about King Henry VIII, to check out a book on Katharine of Aragon, and rent other movies based on King Henry VIII. I love that Ms. Gregory was able to incorporate real history with the fiction of Mary. Terrific book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The whole time I was reading this book, there was an old saying that kept coming to my mind: Pride goeth before a fall. That is exactly what I thought of Anne Boleyn. Now mind you, this was my second attempt in reading \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" I had heard so many rave reviews about this book so two years ago, I picked it up and couldn't get into it. For one thing, it portrayed Anne Boleyn as a scheming and crafty girl, instead of a victim to a man's lust for a son to be his heir. After reading \\"The Queen's Fool\\" ~~ I got snared in with Gregory's writing and just had to try \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" again. This time, I was hooked.I love reading historical fiction. I know that it's fiction based on the few historical gleams that any author could find. I know that the real story may never be known in its fullest truth. So knowing that, I can sit back and enjoy this immense novel about two sisters who vied for the King's attention. How much of it is factual? I don't know. Do I care? No. It's not as if I am going to write a biography on the Tudors. Do I find their lives ~~ supposed and actual ~~ interesting? Oh yes. I have been a devoted fan of Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser, as well as Jean Plaidy ~~ they've whetted my interest in history. So, I know that this book, based on a lot of historical studies, is a work of fiction. If I didn't want to read fiction, I would read different authors ... so my point is, this is a fun book to read.This story was narrated by Mary, the \\"other\\" Boleyn sister. She was newly married and just shortly after Anne returned to England from France, Mary was selected to be the King's lover. Between her uncle and her parents, Mary was a biddable girl who did what her elders told her to do to further the Howard/Boleyn family connections in the king's court. As a very young lady-in-waiting, Mary was prime picking for a king's lust. In this novel, Mary gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son. During the recovery period after her son's birth, Anne decided to further her family's interest and her own personal interest by going after the king. As you can imagine, the relationship between the two sisters were never quite the same after that.While Mary was at her sister's beck and call, she fell in love with an \\"ordinary no-body\\" ~~ William Stafford, a rural landowner. But bidden to do Anne's calling, Mary was in the midst of all the court's intrigues. From her eyes, she told the tale of how Anne came to power and how she intrigued the king to the fatal end. The longer Anne fought to be queen, the more corrupted she seems to be. The more corrupted Anne seem to be, the more reasonable Mary seem to be and more mature of the two.This was a hefty book but oh so much fun to read! It is definitely one of the more enjoyable books I've read this year. I am glad to add Philippa Gregory to my never-ending list of authors to read ~~ she writes well and very convincingly of a time period that little is known. She is a great story-teller ~~ and definitely one to recommend.3-30-07"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an incredible combination of historical truths and fictional character dispositions. Like with any book I had to adjust to the author's style of writing and the lingo of the story's time period but I was almost immediately enraptured by it's unbelievable content! I quickly fell in love with the characters, especially narrator Mary Boleyn who is so identifiable and amiable. This is a great buy if you love period works that involve love, sex, and scandal without betraying good taste and some modesty. I also felt that I had gained quite a bit of knowledge upon finishing the book since I had known very little about King Henry VIII prior to it. Overall I feel that this could become a favorite among many or at least memorable."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's hard to write historical fiction in a way that makes the book hard to put down, but this story rarely slows its pacing. I flew through the pages. Many reviewers have complained that the story was inaccurate. Although it was historical fiction, it nudged my curiousity about the Boleyn family. Now I'm interested to learn what was true and what wasn't in this novel, because the story was so compelling.Choosing Mary as the narrator was an interesting choice; Philippa Gregory gave a little-known historical figure a great personality!There was one thing about the novel that made me reduce the rating to 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the scenes felt like a paperback romance. And some of the language choices didn't seem to fit the era. Call me picky...But was it enjoyable? Yes. Would I recommend reading it? Most definitely!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. The greater than 600 pages was a \\"quick read\\". After finishing I was interested in researching the facts about that era."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is extremely well written. It explores a subject most people know little if anything about and while it is clearly fiction, the historical references are so authentic, you forget that at times. It's not a quick read, being over 400 pages, but it holds the readers interest. If you like history, or romance or are an anglophile, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the fascinating story of the ambitious Boleyn family and their rising star, Anne, who managed to seduce a king, but could not keep him in her grasp. The story is told from the perspective of Mary, Anne's sister. Mary was Henry VIII's lover for awhile, before her ambitious family decided that it should be Anne, not Mary, who would seduce the king in an attempt to marry him and become queen. But although Anne succeeds in this and gives birth to a baby girl - Elizabeth, future queen of England - she cannot give Henry the boy heir he so desperately needs. And we all know what becomes of her as a result.Interspersed with this story is Mary's story, how she was forced to become the king's lover even though she was already married, her love for her children, her growing weariness with court life, and a blossoming new love. Brother George is also a big part of the story, and it is he that Anne and Mary turn to in times of need.More than anything, this is a fascinating read because of the overwhelming ambitions of a family that cannot leave well enough alone. The book gets off to a bit of a slow start, but by the time you're a third of the way through, you are sucked into the story. Even though you know how it ends, you can't put the book down, thanks to Gregory's gripping storytelling skills."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm a bit of an amateur Tudor historian and have been for about five years, so I'm going to come at this review from a different place than someone who doesn't know the true story behind this book and these real-life people.Don't get me wrong -- I love this book. I've read it many, many times and will continue to read it over and over again. But, to be honest, I don't really view it as anything more than a highbrow bodice ripper, hence my title calling it \\"trashy.\\" It's fancy beach reading, but I mean that in the nicest way possible. It's written in a very compelling way and will keep you entertained. Despite it's length, it's a book I can -- and do -- finish rather quickly whenever I read it. It's a pageturner, there's no doubt about it.lMy real issue with this book is, naturally, the historical inaccuracies and great liberties that author Gregory takes with the story of the Tudors. Inaccuracies that she tries to pass off as historical fact. But I am still able to enjoy and appreciate it while also appreciating non-fiction books on the same subject. I sort of view this as an adaptation of history: Movie adaptations rarely follow the book exactly and always take liberties, but a person can still love both the book and the movie. That's kind of how I approach The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The book prompted me to do some research into the historic facts and figures, and for that alone, I am grateful. As for the book itself, I was glad to be done with it. The characters had no development and seemed very one-dimensional. There were too many scenes that seemed redundant and too many conversations that kept reiterating the same points over and over. As a reader, I wished the author had respected me enough to allow me to make my own conclusions instead of beating me over the head with hers. How many times do you need to read about the treatment of the Boleyn girls by their family to grasp that they were a commodity rather than human beings? I got it the first time. All the other references to the same point felt slightly insulting.I liked the details of life in court: dresses, fashion, political events and developments in the background. I did not like that each main character represented ONE personality trait: Anne is an embodiment of blind ambition, Mary is the obedient female, George is a calculating, spineless brother, uncle and father (interchangeable, by the way) together represent the dominating, heartless male, and mom is a cold witch whose character is so underdeveloped it's hard to picture her altogether.In the end, the book felt like a dessert you eat because it's there, not because it's irresistible or worth the calories."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the first book by Philipa Gregory that I read. This book was very interesting and I couldn't put it down. Since then I have read the rest of her books about the Tudor court, and they are all good."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court available, why bother to read this flighty one that reads more like a cheap romance novel than historical fiction? The dialog is insipid; I don't need the characters to speak in authentic period dialog, but I do need them to sound like the intelligent and well educated courtiers they were. I haven't read any of Gregory's other work, but after starting with this book I won't be back. The best thing about the book is that it reads quickly and is over fast."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The characters in this book are, for the most part, absolutely disgusting. I felt guilty reading it, like I was reading some trash romance novel and I think I'll hide it the bookcase in the back of the house so no one who comes over sees it... but I have to say, it's a definate page turner. Well over 600 pages read in two days. And I'll probably read the sequel sometime soon. It's not the most well-written book, but it will definately hold your attention for a little guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory's Tudor novels are my guilty pleasure; I've been (unhealthily?) fascinated by Henry VIII for a very long time, and The Other Boleyn Girl is a deft, imaginative take on a little-known historical personage.However, as you read, be aware that the historical Mary Boleyn has received a major makeover in this book in order to make her more appealing: historians agree that, far from the tender young ingenue Gregory makes her out to be, Mary was in fact the oldest of the three Boleyns, and she was about 20 when she returned to the English court, after being called home from France by her family because of some high-profile indiscretions (probably including an affair with King Francis!). Furthermore, Anne's adoption of Mary's son was fairly common practice in those days, and almost certainly not a callous ploy - in Tudor England, a wealthier relative would often \\"adopt\\" a child in order to offer it advantages of wealth and station. And, finally, Gregory's speculations about the truth behind the charges leveled against Anne Boleyn to justify her beheading are just that, speculations - and Gregory errs on the side of reinforcing the most salacious of them. That's what fiction's all about, but it probably isn't history.That said, when Gregory is not taking liberties with historical facts, she does an excellent job of filling in the gaps between them, particularly the story about Mary and William Stafford. There are some good sexy parts, including a couple of disturbing ones, and the court of Henry VIII is rendered in luscious (albeit sometimes repetitive) detail. If you like descriptions of pearl-encrusted dresses, altar cloth-sewing, and back-room intrigue, and a few (or a lot of) historical inaccuriacies don't bother you, then this is is a great book for a plane ride or a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a must read. I haven't enjoyed a book like this in a long time. I read it in 2 days. I bought it in a book store on a whim. Never having read any book by Philippa Gergory. Now I went on line and bought A Queens Fool, The constant Princess and The Bolryn Inheritance. This book left me wanting more"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love the Tudor period and couldn't believe I had missed this book all those years. Well written and chock full of details about daily life in the court of a young Henry VIII from the POV of a much overlooked character I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I like historical novels. In particular I love reading Bernard Cornwell or Wilbur Smith. This is because of their gifts for meticulous attention to historical detail and their richness of character development. You're there, feeling their lust, their fears, their hatreds, and their triumphs or defeats. So I read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" with anticipation, hoping for the same. In a way, it wasn't fair: we already know Ann Boleyn was beheaded. It was sort of like the first screening of the movie, \\"Fatal Attraction:\\" you knew someone was going to die!Also, the principle protagonist in this book was more the shadow of a character - sort of like Diego Velazquez de Silva's famous painting, \\"Las Meninas (The Maids of Honor)\\" where the actual subject of the painting (King Philip IV) is not in the painting, though everyone else is clearly depicted. Here, Mary Boleyn is a weak character in the center of a malestrom of selfish vanity, pure naked power, and fawning syncophants who in fact are clearly portrayed and ruthless in their grasping for power. Vivid is Henry VIII, a randy, narcissistic, spoiled brat, proving that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The real villains are the Howards and the Boleyn's. These parents of the daughters ruthlessly risk all for wealth, and callously sacrifice their own daughter's lives in the process. You could say that they all got what they deserved. I'd like to see more from Philippa Gregory. I'd like to see better character development, too."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My oh my, what else can I add to the previous reviews? The book is indeed incredibly interesting, compelling, deep, fascinating, with characters that come alive. The book grabs you from the very first page and doesn't let go until you finish it. I usually cannot read such long, long books, but this is the exception. The book is fiction, but based on real history. You know the basic story, how it ends, and yet it is too compelling to put down: you want to know all the details and somehow hope to find out that history could change. Philippa Gregory is a GREAT writer. This will be my favorite book for a long time and I will recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A different take on the story of Anne Boleyn, this novel is told by her overlooked sister, Mary, who was Henry VIII's mistress before he became besotted with Anne. Gregory uses modern language and expressions in her writing, so this novel does not drag a modern reader through a field of Thees and Thous, which IS more historically accurate, but frankly I am not interested in reading a novel that I have to translate. Lots of sexy court plotting and intrigue make this a page-turner perfect for beach reading or a rainy weekend, but I'm afraid serious history buffs will not appreciate the modern take on the story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was impossible to put down. I lived the story; I became a Boleyn, a Howard, a Queen. This is a phenomenal story! Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thought the book was really very good, very well written and all around entertaining. Yes, there were some MINOR, and I do mean MINOR, incorrect historical facts. Yes, Mary was older than Anne. Yes, certain executions are not in chronological order. But the people who are letting these facts bother them are missing out on a wonderful novel.To all those who see Anne as the clearcut 'villian' in the novel - for shame! You seemed to have missed something, something so blatantly obvious that I wonder if you were paying attention. Anne was a Boleyn and a Howard, first and foremost, but she was also a girl. A girl with a heart that was broken by her family, time and time again but a heart deprived of the only boy she ever loved: Having Henry Percy stolen from Anne hardened her heart against everyone and anyone - and any girl whose ever suffered from a broken heart knows just how she felt. Haven't you ever cried and hugged yourself and promised, 'Never again!'. Most girls get over that and learn to love and trust again, but Anne didn't have that chance - she was too busy being a courtier. She couldn't trust her family - even her closest friends, George and Mary, had their own agendas.Anne's broken heart never recovered and she felt she would only be vindicated if she became Queen. Nothing mattered more then the queenship, not George's forbidden love, not Mary's happiness. Nothing.I think that point alone makes Anne so much more approachable. In her desperation, she was wonderful enchantress. And towards the end, when she was alone and desperate and friendless, she couldn't stand to see anyone else happy. She committed horrendous atrocities on her path to the throne, but felt remorse for them. The one thing I felt Gregory should have included was that Anne asked Princess Mary for forgiveness the night before her execution.But I digress. It was a wonderful story, if you can take it for what it is. 'The other Boleyn Girl' is indeed Mary, pushed to the side but ultimately happy - but the victim of the story is without a doubt Anne, the Boleyn Girl whose broken heart would eventually lead her to ruin."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Let me just say that I found this book to be a good &quot;fluffy&quot; read. I didn't love it, nor did I hate it--and I think that's because I kept wanting to slap the main charactor for being so weak willed. By the time I reached the end, I threw down the book and exclaimed, &quot;Well, it's about time!&quot; This book is a cross between Tudor England and Cosmo magazine: juicy with gossip but lacking any real depth. But, if you've got nothing better to do, and you happen to be a junkie for the Tudors...have at it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Like many others who have read this book, I've been fascinated by the Tudor era and have read quite a lot about it. I enjoyed the idea of a story written from the perspective of the sister and it was interesting up to a point, but then....Anne Boleyn is portrayed as such a hideous harridan that it's almost unbelievable that Henry VIII would have put up with her. Philippa Gregory has also taken every single accusation and rumor thrown at Anne during her trial (when her enemies were hell bent on character assassination) and uses them all as fact. (brief spoiler), When Anne essentially gives birth to Rosemary's Baby/Eraserhead I actually laughed out loud.A good attempt, but ultimately this book disappointed me."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I judge books by their cover. Oh shut up, so do you. I'd been eyeing The Other Boleyn Girl for a long time...such a nice cover. The right weight. Good title.For the first 100 pages or so, utterly unimpressed. I felt like I was back in high school, reading girly fiction. \\"She brushed back her shining raven locks, admired her slim figure in the mirror\\" etc etc, is the sort of drivel that dripped from this almost romance novel like book. It got better when Anne started to edge out Mary in the King's favor, but up until then, I felt like I wanted to stop reading. When the court intrigue, and inter-family backstabbing started, so did the book.I have to admit, the author probably had a fairly hard time finding material on Mary Boleyn- not much was known about her, except her three marriages, her two children, and of course her brief affair with the King during her first marriage. Other than that, Mary was pretty much a big blank. To give her life, must have been a hard task, and she is a likeable character, unlike Anne Boleyn. The Anne Boleyn in The Other Boleyn Girl, and the Anne Boleyn of Margaret George's The Autobiography of Henry VIII differ greatly. One is beautiful, one is homely, but her spark captures Henry's interest. Both are not exactly moral, but The Other Boleyn Girl makes you hate her, while The Autobiography makes you think of her as adulterer, with ambition, but the ambitious drive of The Other Boleyn Girl's Anne is truly scary.All in all, I rarely DON'T enjoy a book, and this was no exception. Once past the flighty first few chapters, I enjoyed the backstabbing- probably like those in Rome enjoyed a good lion vs gladiator fight in the Coliseum."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Although I'm resorting to cliches, this book practically read itself. In fact, I found myself scooting out of the office to read a passage or two. Based on the life of Anne, Mary and George Boleyn as well as the court of King Henry the VIII, The Other Boleyn Girl is a beautiful, enthralling read.Mary, Anne's younger sister, is the enchanting main character in this novel. Philippa Gregory does an incredible job bringing her to life and transporting the reader back to England in the 1500's. This fictional account of Mary's affair with King Henry is as enticing as it is romantic. The Other Boleyn Girl's telling of the most celebrated and notorious romances in England's history is well written and insightful - not to mention mesmerizing.From life at the court to life in the fields, The Other Boleyn girl has it all: love, adventure and intrigue. This is by far one of the best books I have read this summer."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's tough being a Tudor lover, especially when you're also a European history major. The trashy movies, TV shows, and novels just don't seem to end.But this piece blew me farther away than most with its incredible levels of sensationalist inaccuracy.Why? When history has provided us with such a vibrant tapestry of dynamic, intriguing characters, real people living real lives, why must we reduce them to soap opera depth and dignity?Ordinarily I wouldn't bother with adding to the voices debating this book; there are plenty of people doing that already. But when I saw this:\\"I recommend this book and all of the Tudor novels written by Philippa Gregory to anyone who loves true historical fiction.\\"... I had to speak up.To anyone reading: this is NOT TRUE HISTORY! This is trashy, inaccurate drivel! The history of humanity is too deeply thrilling and too important to be obscured by this level of sludge. There is no excuse for this kind of ignorance in the modern age; a quick Internet search can render treasure troves of information like our ancestors could only dream of. Get your historical knowledge from Google, if you like, but not from Gregory.I don't have anything against sensationalist romances. If that floats your boat, great. But I do have issue with the subject I care so passionately for being trampled without apology.So read the book, if you like; enjoy it even. But please, please don't take anything it says to be real history! We deserve to be better informed than this."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I usually love historical fiction. I think it's fascinating when a writer does her research and presents a story that, while true in its historical accuracy, manages to bring a character to life and lend it a bit of modern sophistication. I love feeling that connection with a character from the past, so I was looking forward to reading this novel. The problems are many. First of all, Ms. Gregory has cast aside much of what modern historians accept as fact; namely, that Mary was the older sister, that her children's paternity was always questioned, and there is no evidence to suggest their brother was gay. The addition of these elements serves to cheapen this novel, relegating it to a tabloid of sorts. Historical inaccuracies aside, I also found flaws in the writing itself. Run-on sentences abound, affecting the overall fluency. Also, the characters are so exaggerated as to be quite unbelievable. Anne is portrayed as purely evil, seeking her own selfish ambitions with no regard for her family, while Mary is portrayed as a pure and innocent child who is used unwillingly by her ambitious family.The reason I decided to give it 3 stars is because, if you can ignore the \\"historical\\" aspect, it is a riveting tale. The 600+ pages went by fairly quickly for me, and I was honestly interested in the story, particularly that of Mary and William's courtship. It takes a large imagination and no small amount of talent to invent such a touching courtship, and for that, she is to be commended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found this book entertaining despite the romance novel devices. Anne Boleyn fans beware - this is not a multi-dimensional portrayal of the historical figure. This Anne is more Scarlett O'Hara or Becky Sharp - willing to use anybody and suffer anything to achieve her ambitions. She does have a few vulnerable moments that make her sympathetic occasionally, but mainly she is a foil to Mary's blondness and relative niceness (the historical Mary Boleyn's alleged sexual escapades are toned down or omitted in this novel). This Anne is far more bitchy than spiritual or charitable - but of course that's why the book is so popular. After all, several enduring novels use this classic device of one nice girl and one nasty one and the sibling rivalry makes this story all the more emotional.Mary narrates the story, so that could excuse some of the negative portrayal of Anne. They are both rivals for the king's attention and rivals for their parents' affections. The coldness of the parents and Uncle Norfolk make the closeness between the three siblings George, Anne and Mary all the more poignant. George is charming and witty in this novel, Anne is self-centered and witty, and Mary is the romantic heroine, but she is not totally likeable. Before she defies her family to marry for love, she repeatedly betrays Queen Katharine by spying on her and seducing the king right in front of her - then she grovels before Katherine and declares how much she enjoys serving her. She knows she's a little hypocrite - she repeatedly uses snake imagery to describe herself and her relatives. My favorite line is: \\"George and I smiled encouragingly, the Boleyn smile: a pair of pleasant snakes.\\"The author used many of the more controversial theories from Retha Warnicke's biography of Anne Boleyn as historical background, rather than a more well rounded and historically accurate sampling - but it made an entertaining story. The relationship between the 3 siblings is what kept me reading: perhaps closer than is healthy, but understandable considering their awful parents. This novel should have made a great movie due to the lurid story and historical characters - it is just a shame that neither of the movies made picked up on any of George's, Anne's or even Mary's charm - that is what really makes me want to read the book again.Now for the bad. First, Some of the dialogue is incredibly annoying unless you like romance novels. The siblings repeatedly call each other \\"silly whore\\" and stuff like that to excess, more like modern reality show trash than young Tudor aristocrats. Second, most of the other characters are one dimensional: The family elders are all self-serving, ambitious and cold with no redeeming traits whatsoever. The king is a spoiled brat, and the queen is pious and regal, but you don't find out much about her inner mind - she is developed in another book by the author. Mary's second husband is just too good to be true: he never loses his temper, super lover, super stepfather, helps deliver his own child, etc. etc. Oh, her kids are perfect little angels too. Third, I do have a respect for history and I would have preferred a more factual story, although that didn't stop me from enjoying this book. The queen committing incest with her brother - come on, most people understand that the incest charge was always used against top ranking females when they wanted to ensure a death verdict (witness Marie Antoinette) and historians have proven to most people's satisfaction that the incest charge against Anne was trumped up. I think the story would have been just fine without that prurient scene, since not very believable in fact.All in all, a very enjoyable story if read purely as entertainment."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Disclaimer: I love historical fiction; so I don't know if this would be a great read for anyone, but...I loved it as a historical fiction fan. I have stuck with mostly Italian in the past, but this was a very exciting \\"jump\\" into British historical fiction--specifically the CRAZY world of the Tudors and Henry's 6 wives.I was totally enthralled with this book--but not until around page 200. So the first bit I was having a hard time buying into it because I thought Mary was kind of annoying and weak. But as the book progresses, she ages (obviously) and her relationship with Anne, the Boleyn family, the King, and pretty much everyone around her is really fascinating. She finally grows some \\"balls\\" and you're rooting for her to escape the treachery of the Boleyn family and FIND LOVE. It sounds cheesy here but there is seriously nothing cheesy about this book.I know that I love a book when I'm constantly looking up the history in encyclopedias and finding other books in this area. I was a little disappointed to hear that there really isn't much documented history pertaining to Mary in real life, but from what I have read (very VERY preliminary), Gregory is right on and has solid backing for what she has written. Also, I am very impressed with historical fiction writers who use the actual historical character as the center of the story versus using a fictional character and having things happen around them. It seems much harder to do it the way Gregory has done and it truly is a masterpiece--entertaining and historically accurate!READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A nice, easy and interesting read. Very keen insight on the politics and intrigue in Henry VIII's court. The only criticism is the lack of historical accuracy. Don't presume that what you read is true history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love well-written, engaging historical novels. This effort did not disappoint. Not exactly a love story, but it does endear you to Mary, Ann Boleyn's sister, and holds you to see whether Mary at least finds true happiness. Gregory is very good at offering enough details of the era to fascinate and entertain, without being tedious and overshadowing the story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory has written a delicious novel of sin, adultery, and ambition. True, this is not lofty literature. True, it is not \\"historical\\" truth. But, it IS enjoyable. Despite the length, which may lose some readers, I did find it kept me engaged. What an insane time to live, particularly for women, who were forced to use their bodies for their family's advantage. They were pawns in a larger game, and it is no wonder that some, such as Anne, sought a position of power from which to control their own fates. Gregory does a wonderful job in developing her characters. I particularly like that she has the \\"losing\\" sister tell the tale. I really felt the characters' pain, their triumphs and failures. I was rooting for them until the end. A well-crafted tale that will leave the reader satisfied, but still wanting more..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you read this book be prepared to be captured by it until you have completed it! I couldn't put it down nor could most members of my book club! It's a 600 page book but most people had it completed in a week (a week they didn't get too much else done!)This book is based on historical fact, and the author picked some great characters in history: the intrigue, political backstabbing, mnipultions, alliances, affairs - you name it and this book had it!The author has implemented a wonderful writing style that continually pulls you in.I am somewhat familiar with the history of King Henry the 8th and that era - having studied it to some degree (though the book is just as good if you are not familiar with the history, as attested by members of my bookclub.) This book brought it all together for me - by seeing the players behind the curtains of history and in a more personalized way through a novel the players and events of history became more real to me.I strongly recommend it - as I already have to many friends!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I could kick myself for not reading this book sooner! I've had in on my TBR list for a long time and kept putting it off, thinking it wasn't really my cup of tea.... boy, was I wrong! From page one, I was hooked! Phillipa Gregory is amazing! The Other Boleyn Girl is such a beautiful book. Gregory's ability to mix fact with fiction is just unbelievable. I now find myself fascinated with the Tudors and Boleyns. Gregory has opened up a whole new genre for me and I am now reading everything I can on the subject. Even if you don't become a Tudor fanatic like me, you will love this book! It is amazing!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While reading this book, I was never sure who the 'other Boleyn girl' actually was. At times it referred to Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister who conducted an affair with King Henry and bore him two children, and at other times it seemed to refer to Anne herself, who's driven ambition ultimately led her to the block. This is a nice twist on the title which would lead you to believe that it was only Mary who was considered beneath contempt as the other Boleyn sister's fortunes rose.The choice of having Mary Boleyn as narrator of this story was inspired as it provides a completely different look at the complexities of court life and an intimate look at what it must have been like to be so tied to the future Queen of England even as your loyalties lay with the current Queen, Katherine of Aragon. Mary is between a rock and a hard place and her guilt and confusion come through so clearly on the pages. Katherine is portrayed sympathetically here as the cuckolded wife who must bear her husband's infidelities even as they happen right in front of her.As she goes from being the pawn in her family's game to raise the family's name at court to being a mere lady-in-waiting to her sister who manages to usurp her position, she realizes that her ultimate dream would be to own a farm in the country and to raise her children in peace, away from the glittering, cut-throat court. As Anne finally becomes Queen of England, you get Mary's constant commentary on the familiar story of her inability to provide the King with a male heir, her frantic attempt to sustain her crown, and her eventual downfall ending with her beheading. If I didn't already have a picture of her as a selfish manipulator, I would have been absolutely infuriated by her after reading of her behavior in this book!This is definitely a work of fiction as not much is known about Mary Boleyn, but what entertaining fiction it is! Note: It does help to have a bit of background knowledge about the major players as the names and titles can get a bit confusing."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I just finished this book for a book club and I was very skeptical at first because I'm not, or rather wasn't, a fan of novels that take place \\"way back when\\". This book is so entertaining, you forget that you're in the 21st Century when reading it because you become so absorbed. The author did an excellent job of portraying these characters and the further into the novel you go, the more and more you want to get back in time and take care of some things! It was very sad to see this book end but I hope to find more historical novels of the same caliber! DEFINITELY GIVE IT A READ!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was skeptical when I read the reviews at first, as usual. After purchasing the book, during one of those nights where you are simply too bored to do anything except to laze around and seriously need something good and interesting book to read, I pick this book up and did just that! Philippa Gregory is such a magnificent author!!! This book will put you through the journey of the life of the Boelyns'. The words just mesmorised you, letting you visualise what is actually happening. A story about betrayals, love, power and a peek at the history of England."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If someone had told me that they were reading a book about Ann Boleyn's sister, I would have thought, &quot;yawn,&quot; since that isn't my &quot;type&quot; of book. I found this book to be exciting, interesting, educational and a lot of fun. My Dad loaned it to me and told me to beware, it's hard to put down. He was right! I was a little sad at the end of the book to be finished. In fact, I logged on to Amazon to see if there is a sequel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I would not recommend Phillipa Gregory's much-hyped The Other Boleyn Girl. I'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that doesn't make a good first impression, hoping it'll improve. Some six-hundred pages later, I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good. Please don't waste your time! Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as \\"He was executed the next day.\\" Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader! It's extraordinary. It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course, it's a matter of opinion. I simply found it to be void of anything of substance. I wasn't made to care about the characters or how the events played out. And only sex carried the plot along!Also, I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory's imagination, not historical facts. I'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she didn't have a sister or anything of the sort. And I know in this genre much is left to the author's imagination and interpretation; it has to be. It's not as though there's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history. But Gregory herself, when asked how she researches for her books, said she first goes to secondary sources. She never mentioned using primary sources. Yes, they can be biased (if they're from someone's perspective they're going to be), but they're first-hand accounts. Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it, witnessing it? In addition, her dialogue is inconsistent. It's ridiculously modern at some points, then flowery at others. I know it can't be written Shakespeare-style; it has to be readable and understandable. But I think we could be a little more sophisticated! No one said \\"stuff\\" back then, for example, as in, \\"All this stuff is making me mad.\\" She couldn't work a little harder than that??If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses, sex, and scandal, this soap-opera mimic is perfect. If you're like me and want to learn something in the process, however...As I've made obvious, I was sorely disappointed. Just thought I'd pass my warning along. I don't want anyone else wasting his time!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I chose the book that displays the original cover because the newest film version cover makes me sick....the movie was so lousy compared to the mastery of this book!!!The book is captivating so much in the depth of it's characters, the richness of the content and the rawness of her descriptions - that I could not put it down. It honestly made me delve into this whole new (well not new....just more publicly noticed) genre of Historical Fiction. I acutally was inspired to learn more about British history, to compare names, dates, and places in the story. It was such an adventure to me - and I learned a lot with the facts in the book, mixed in with the fantasy.It's such a great read, that the only disappointment I had was trying out every other Gregory book, and being sorely disappointed. The Virgin's Lover comes close - but not nearly as tantalizing. Every one knows the factual endings to these stories....but it's the means to the ends that captures you!If you enjoy reading a little bit about history, but in a more imaginative \\"what if?\\" way - you will LOVE this story!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I avoided this book for a long time. After reading dozens of books on Tudor history over the years I didn't see the need to read a fictional telling of the tale of Anne Boleyn. But several friends whose taste I respect praised this book to the heavens and finally I succumbed. Unfortunately, I didn't like it.I don't fault this book for changing the facts of Anne and Mary Boleyn's lives or for imposing motivations that don't jibe with the current academic opinion or for putting distinctly 20th century dialogue in the mouths of 16th century characters. This is fiction and Philippa Gregory is entitled to use history to suit her story.I've enjoyed fictionalizations of true stories before and I knew going in that Gregory makes controversial dramatic choices. The problem wasn't the fiction, it was that the fiction wasn't compelling enough to make me forget what I knew and just be carried along by the story. No matter how I tried I'd find myself thinking, that's not what happened, or, wait a minute, that's not why Anne went to France, etc. Gregory's 20th century phrasing and 20th century motivations kept creeping in, too, jolting me out of the story. Then I'd start noticing things that didn't jibe with the facts and the way people thought in the 16th century. It didn't help that so few of the characters in the book are truly likable either.I've come to the conclusion that if you're a Tudor-phile, if the names Chapuys, Campeggio, Eric Ives and Retha Warnicke ring any bells, then you'll likely have a hard time suspending disbelief enough to enjoy this book. It's a weird thing but the more likely you are to be interested in the subject matter, the less entertainig this book is. If you know only the bare outlines of Anne Boleyn's story, or less, then you might enjoy this book as much as my friends have."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was an entertaining book--in fact, I could hardly put it down. However, as I read, I became increasingly uncomfortable with the historical inaccuracies introduced merely to juice up the plot. I became annoyed with the devices that appeared with irritating predictability; for example, the horse that just happened to lose a shoe preventing escape and requiring the characters to remain to the end of the story. (How inconvenient to lose your narrator to intelligent self-preservation.) Also I found the occasional feminist twist clumsy and intrusive. This is not to suggest that noblewomen would have been unaware of the unfairness of gender roles, but I doubt they would have articulated their views to the peasants who happened to till their family's fields. It injected a kind of revisionist aspect to the story--something I find increasingly annoying in all aspects of today's world. There were too many obvious contrivances included merely to please or to \\"improve\\" the story--something I find disrespectful to the reader as well as the characters. Indeed, if one wants to write fiction, why graft it onto real events and individuals (implying that it is a historical account)? I have not objected before, when a writer took liberties with history in order to tell a story but in such cases, it was clear that the story only loosely followed a particular time or character. This story is fiction disguising itself as a historical account. I don't wish to minimize the fact that this book is very well written and the descriptions are rich and fascinating. The author is very skillful. However, I will not read any more of her books. I felt cheated as if I had gone to an expensive restaurant expecting a meal prepared from scratch and with authentic ingredients, only to receive a supermarket microwaved entry--edible but not creditable."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is not great literature but it is a quick/easy/fun 600+pages page-turner. I found myself staying up late to read it -- even jumped onto the internet at 1am to check historical facts and review what is known about Henry VIII and court intrigues of the time. That Hank was a sleaze is common knowledge. I didn't realize the extent to which the power players put young girls into his bed or the involvement of the siblings. I definitely would have enjoyed the book more if Phillipa Gregory's style was less Jackie/Joan Collins. Mary's romantic attraction to her second husband was a bit far-fetched (par for made-for-tv-movie). My book club buds most objected to the women's libber sentiments attributed to the book's main characters in sixteenth century England. And we had an interesting conversation on nature v nurture when Mary (unlike most courtesans abandoned to nursemaids from birth) had such strong maternal instincts towards her own children. We'll definitely drink margaritas then go see the movie when it comes out (Ann-Natalie Portman, Mary-Scarlett Johanssen, Henry-Eric Bana). From the book's characterization, I would have cast Angelina Jolie as Ann, but then that's what the professionals get paid to do :)C"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"In the process of researching my family tree, I discovered that I am descended from Mary Boleyn. After researching everything possible about Tudor England, I came across this book. Not knowing what to expect I began reading it and became so engrossed that I couldn't put it down.This was the first time I'd read any of Philippa Gregory's books, but I was impressed with her ability as a storyteller and with her research. The book gives you the Boleyn family story from the perspective of Mary, the lesser known Boleyn girl, but the one who was equally exploited in the attempt to win the heart of King Henry VIII. The story covers a period of 15 years, from the time Mary is still a newly wedded wife of 12, to the execution of her sister Anne. All of the intrigue, gossip, scandal, and treachery of life within the court of one of the most powerful kings in history is woven together in such a way that you feel you are one of the courtiers.Throughout the story, Mary is portrayed as a pawn in the family chess game of gaining power within the kingdom. She is told she must do the family's bidding, that their position and power with the king are at stake. At the age of 13, Mary is taken from the bed of her husband of less than 1 year and installed as Henry's mistress, a relationship that will last almost 4 years and produce 2 children. Not only is Mary juggling the family's plotting and scheming, but she is also dealing with the bitter jealousy and rivalry with her sister, Anne. As the story progresses it explores not only the power struggle for a Howard-Boleyn girl to win and hold Henry's favor, it also explores the love-hate relationship of Anne, Mary, and their brother, George as they dance to the tune of the family's bidding.Also woven into the story is the affect this has on Mary's marriage, her life in general, the lives of her children, and ultimately her sense of self worth as a woman. One of the most compelling moments in the book is when Mary realizes that she is in love with William Stafford, the man who becomes her second husband. The realization that she loves him and love is enough for her is a powerful one. As she realizes that she can be happy married to a commoner we see new depth to her character and a new spirit come alive in her.For anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, I highly recommend this book. It is not difficult to read, the story is entertaining, and it puts a whole new spin on the history surrounding the Boleyns and King Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl takes a few too many liberties in placing Mary Boleyn at the center of every single thing that goes on. History states that she was dismissed from court in 1534 and did not return. It also takes the traditionally patriarchal view of AB as a social-climbing shrew, as if she hasn't been maligned enough. At 500+ pages, this book still skims over the surface of events and is very, very talky. Sometimes Gregory seems so determined to cram everything in, and has such a melodramatic flair, that it's hard to connect with the characters' feelings (there's a lot of \\"I did this,\\" \\"s/he said that.\\"). Also nauseating is the author interview in the back, in which Gregory disparages nearly every single other form of fiction writing. Tacky.And by the way, the operative word in \\"historical fiction\\" is the former, not the latter. If Gregory's going to deviate from the known facts to the extent she has (i.e. everyone who complained that the error in Mary's age was nitpicking), then why bother to name them Mary and Anne Boleyn at all? Why not just tell a good, fictional story, rather than dressing it up as something it's not? From some of these reviews, you get the feeling some people wouldn't object if the author had made Anne Boleyn a gas station attendant in Des Moines, Iowa."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read a lot of historical fiction -- and more than a few about Henry the 8th and Elizabeth I's time -- but this was by far one of the best I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up all night two different evenings until I fell sleep. Even knowing that the general outcome of Anne Boleyn, it was completely fascinating the way Phillipa Gregory developed every character in this book. Each person became alive -- good and bad, villain and angel -- so that you felt like you actually could see these people, hear them talk and knew them intimately. It's a tale about the human spirit, and a wonderful love story that is intricately woven in with a great deal of historical fact. Anyone who loved the trilogy about Josephine Bonaparte will especially love this story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"There is nothing like being able to tell oneself how virtuous and intellectual one is being by reading historical fiction, whilst enjoying a mildly pornographic novel. Or not enjoying it. This reader prefers historical fiction to concentrate more on the politics and society, and less on graphic descriptions of king Henry VIII's sexual preferences. Or at least to include a warning that a period of great religious change and debate will be happening outside the bedroom door."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's nave and unique generosity.That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.She wants readers to get an \\"insight into the psychology\\" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is \\"The Virgin's Lover\\"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel \\"The Queen's Fool\\" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful \\"Earthly Joys\\" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)So, get \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's \\"Legacy\\"."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Book came in great condition--as advertised. Fast shipping and great price very pleased!And the book itself is a page turner, never before have I read a 600 page book in less than a week! I highly reccommend!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a great inside look into the world of Henry VIII. I've been an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction historical novels, and this definitely gave me a better look into the lives of women in the Tudor period. The book is supposed to be about Mary Boleyn, but it really focuses on Anne Boleyn and her personality as well. The relationship she had with her siblings was warm, yet still full of the jealousies that many sisters feel towards each other. Anne Boleyn was a vivacious and passionate person, though she did have her flaws. Her relationship with Henry took center stage for much of the middle of the book, but it didn't make it any less riveting. Anne Boleyn is probably one of the most interesting women in history, and to see Gregory's perception of her life was eye-opening.George, Anne's brother, was also another interesting case, especially since Gregory took Retha M. Warnicke's view on him. I don't want to give it away, but the new way of perceiving George was also astounding.Finally, Mary Boleyn herself was an interesting character. None of us will ever know if she truly loved King Henry VIII or just doing what her father and uncle bid her, but the startling true fact about her is that she actually did marry for love and live in the country. For noble women to do that at that time period was unheard-of, and Mary's story involving the last days of Anne Boleyn was tear-jerking.One of my favorite books to date, and relatively accurate, The Other Boleyn Girl is an amazing novel that will leave the reader wanting for nothing, except maybe to learn more about the haunting characters."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a fabulous book that I could not put down and when I finished it, I immediately went looking for more of her books!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a very creative way of viewing the story of Anne Boleyn through the eyes of her lesser known sibling, Mary."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Book is very different than the movie, it's more indept.

Very entertaining, edge of your seat suspense, so well written you'll start speaking the King's English!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Years go I was addicted to historical novels but haven't read many in the last couple of years and really looked forward to reading The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory when it was selected for a book club read.The other Boleyn girl of the title is Mary Boleyn, whom little if anything has been recorded about in history books. But Philippa Gregory has taken thsi young woman and drawn a vivid picture of her, first as a young woman and then a maore matrue woman who not only suffers at the hands of Henry but then at the hands of her sister, Anne, in her quest for power.Married at 12, Mary is a lady in waiting for Katherine of Aragon, wife of Henry VIII, when Henry expresses a lively interest in Mary. Despite that Mary, now 14, already has a husband her parents, uncle and brother George are pleased at the idea that in time and if she plays her cards right she will become Henry's mistress. And what if she gives him a son? They can only imagine all of the good things which will come to their family if this happens, never considering what Mary's opinions or feelings are about all of this. Then Mary's sister Anne arrives from the court of France and she becomes Mary's chief advisor and confidante in the pursuit of the King's affection and love for Mary. But outward appearances may be one thing and despite how kind Anne seems towards helping Mary, she really has her own agenda in mind concerning Henry. Even the birth of Henry's two illegitimate children -- a daughter and son, makes no difference to Henry and in time he does spurn her for Anne. Mary is once again relegated to being a lady in waiting when Henry divorces Katherine and Anne becomes his mistress and Queen of a very different England.I often say as a reader that its not the destination that matters but the journey. In the case of The Other Boleyn Girl, I'm sure that most readers know the fate of the famous Anne Boleyn to say nothing of what becomes of her daughter Elizabeth I. But before I read this book I knew very little about Mary Boleyn or her family in general. Therefore I looked forward to reading this book from both a historical viewpoint as well as the fictional characterizations the author penned. Unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed in this title considering the raves I heard about from other readers. At over 650 pages, I found this book quite repetitive and at times downright boring. I thought early on it could have used a better editor and some pages might have been eliminated as well. While many of the passages describing court life, the entourage of Henry's court traveling from one place to another set the stage for the book, it was the scenes between Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George which at times became most irritating. As I read on, Anne became more and more of a shrew, being abrasive and abusive towards her silently suffering sister and at one point I wondered if I wanted to continue the book to the end. I did persevere but did think that the book could have been shorter and none of the tale would have been compromised. In addition, despite the amount of research, there were some pretty obvious inaccuracies which took away from my reading pleasure.Ultimately I did give this book a B rating based on the authors efforts in writing a book about this woman and her family and there were some parts which I really did enjoy. Finally in closing, recently a sequel of sorts to The Other Boleyn Girl was recently published called The Queen's Fool. As I am scheduled to read this with a book club shortly, I do hope I enjoy this title more than The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It is not the best portrayal of Anne Boleyn.

Great to read and entirely entertaining. The characters are vivid."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is absolutely fantastic! The full account as told by this novel, transcends the on-screen film adaptation by leaps and bounds; if you haven't read this book you are missing out on 3/4 of the story. As with many film adaptations, this book outshines the on-screen performances and the story it tells. This novel is full of manipulations, political manoeuvring, deceit and heart-wrenching treachery; as the Boleyn's rise in power so to does their risk of safety and death by treason. Torn loyalties and familial affection become twisted into a grotesque mask of hatred, jealousy and spite. The flowing narrative is uninterrupted by any sluggishness and keeps the reader absorbed from start to finish. As the plot progresses a sense of impending doom grows; it gets diverted from time to time but it keeps building until the very end. With breathtaking prose, the Author creates a world and its various English settings with a poignancy that flows over you like cool waters in a brook; the picturesque beauty of the outdoor scenes nearly had me in tears. When a family is willing to throw away their morals, values and sell there very souls for a chance at the wealth, status and the throne of England, who knows what can happen.

If you like a saucy romance and imagining what it must have been to be a woman in the King's court in those days, I highly recommend this book.Power Path to Love"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book single-handedly got me interested in historical fiction. I loved it! I loved how it was historically accurate, yet turned into a really good story. I could identify with the characters - the struggles and powerlessness of women, the greed of the crown and noblemen and the fear of King Henry VIII. I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I decided that I simply must read the book before I saw the movie. It has been my experience movie versions are typically vastly inferior to the books themselves. With that in mind, let's move on to the book review.When the book begins, Gregory introduces us to Mary Boleyn, the younger sister of the much more famous Anne Boleyn, or Queen Anne of England and second wife of Henry VIII. Mary was married at the tender age of twelve to William Carey, yet another courtier. As a member of the powerful Boleyn family, Mary's marriage to William Carey was arranged and in reality was not much of a marriage at all. By the age of fourteen, Mary was King Henry's lover and confidante. We learn that she went on to (supposedly) bear him two children: a boy and a girl.Mary's favor in Henry's court, however, burns out quickly after the birth of her son. She discovers that dancing to the Boleyn family's tune is not what she wants and her disinterest in Henry rapidly turns his interest toward Anne. It is then that Mary becomes the other Boleyn girl.Anne spends six long years courting Henry, and her efforts clearly exhaust her. Mary is expected to answer her sister's every whim, her every beck and call. She is of no import to her family other than what she can do for Anne.Anne is not someone you'd wish to know in your daily life. She's scheming, backstabbing, temperamental, witty, charming, clever, and too confident for her own good. All of those traits are what ultimately lead her to her fall from grace. But Mary has a love-hate relationship with her sister. They are each other's best friend but worst enemy as well.George, Mary and Anne's brother, throws another wrench into the equation. It's clear that he has homosexual desires, which was a deadly sin in those days when the Catholic Church ruled the western European world. Yet he also has a disturbingly close relationship with Anne, and the book implies that it could have been an incestuous one.Gregory managed to throw so many twists and turns into her historically based novel that I never really knew what was coming next. I knew the Anne Boleyn story from history classes in high school and college, but I actually find her sister Mary's story more intriguing. After all, Mary was the only Boleyn sibling who managed to survive during the period of Anne and George's trials. Was it a survival instinct on her part? Or was it wisdom? Perhaps it was self-preservation?We'll never know.Gregory certainly has a gripping writing style, and for most of the book, I felt as if I were reading Mary's intimate diary and not a historically based fictionalized account of her life. Kudos to Gregory. I can't wait to read the second book in the series."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It is possibly unfair of me to review this book before finishing it, though I don't believe my chief complaint -- the atrocious writing -- would change, in any case. I'm also not sure I'll be able to finish it, because Gregory's prose is like nails on a blackboard: repetitious, unoriginal, shallow, and riddled with trite phrasing. So if you're looking for good literature, don't look here. On the other hand, if you're looking for a good story and can stomach the awful writing, the boring tendency to list things instead of actually describing them in some depth, and the repetition, give it a try. It needs some tightening and a good editorial hand, but alas . . . I don't generally care for historical fiction and perhaps this is just the way it's done (tho' one need only read EL Doctorow's \\"Ragtime\\" to get an idea of what a truly good writer can do with history and fiction), but I found myself cringing at the superficial, tedious writing style and rolling my eyes at the \\"Harlequin Romance\\"-style prose: \\"I laughed wrecklessly\\" . . . \\"He did not take his eyes off of me\\" (about 10 billion times) . . . \\"He cupped my chin in his hand\\" . . .

This book offers a fresh look at the tale of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and the inner-tickings of Tudor Court life. I have often been annoyed with other authors of historical fiction for taking situations that were little more than the pimping and selling of aristocratic young girls for family advancement and wealth, and turning them into romantic courtly love. Gregory approaches the scheming of the Howard family with brutal honesty, and manages to realistically capture the confused feelings of infatuation, flattery, frustration, hurt, and love in an adolescent girl as she is preyed upon/courted, used/loved, and discarded by the King and her family. I would also recommend reading the series on Josephine Bonaparte by Sandra Gulland if you enjoy non-stop action, emotional involvement with characters, and a realistic view of the complex personalities of dynamic rulers."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a very good read for historical fiction. We got heaving bosoms, secret homosexual affairs, and power-grabbing men and women all over the place.

But Ms Gregory has a few of the facts a little muddled, and as history is always stranger than fiction, I do have to wonder why she chose to change anything about this fantastic story. For example, Ann was Mary's younger sister, not elder, and this may have put quite a different spin on their relationship. Mary's son Henry was her first born child, not second. And finally, there was absolutely no evidence that Ann ever committed incest with her brother George, and the book hints very heavily that this was indeed what happened.I guess we can just pass this off as historical fiction, and Ms Gregory certainly does do this well, painting a vivid image of Ann as a young woman who gambled all and lost, and endangered her family in the process. But this was a well documented time in history, and whereas I am willing to give historical authors a lot of leeway with characterisation, I do like my facts to be right.It is a ripping tale all right, and it is well written, but I still found myself disappointed with the liberties taken with the facts."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a NOVEL and none of it is factual.

Anne was the younger sister, but was not fifteen when she came to the English court; she was probably closer to 20 and was a maid of honor tho Henry's siter Mary, the Dowager Queen of France.

I liked the premise that Gregory suggested -- describing the story of the doomed Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, through the eyes of her sister, Mary Boleyn Carey Stafford.I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book, but am thankful I didn't waste my money. Gregory's research is decent -- unlike other reviewers, I realize this is \\"fiction,\\" meaning the author can do whatever she thinks makes sense. The lack of blow-by-blow history didn't bother me. What did was that the characterizations were trite and one-dimensional, with the major players in the novel thoroughly unlikeable.Anne Boleyn isn't regarded favorably by many scholars for many reasons, some of which were justified, others not. But Gregory's interpretation of Anne as evil and arrogance extraordinaire was a little much, even for those who find plenty to dislike about her. In other fictional accounts about Anne Boleyn, most authors have the good sense to make her a sympathetic character, at least near the end. Getting beheaded can tend to put a character in a sympathetic light. But in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" the portrayal of Anne was so dreadful, I was almost glad when she lost her head at the end of the book.But Anne wasn't the only one that suffered in this novel. The portrait of the entire Boleyn family was dull and one-dimensional, like something out of a bad soap opera. Instead of painting a ruthless picture of an ambitious family trying to claw its way to the throne, Gregory decided to formulate Mamma and Papa Boleyn as a Simon Legree type, throwing Mary to the wolves whenever and wherever possible. The portrayals were so theatrical and overblown, it was almost funny.Then there's Mary, who was really hard to like. I wanted to see some backbone in Mary, as she was not only the heroine, but the narrator. But she was portrayed as a wimp, rather than a pawn with a mind of her own. A flakey, whiney, hard-to-like character. And I have to agree with another review I read -- the position Gregory put Mary in at the end of the book stretched the bounds of credibility of even the loosest historical fiction.About the only redeeming quality was the author's portrayal of George Boleyn, Anne and Mary's brother. George, at least, had some fire and facets to his personality, unlike his sisters.In all, I'm wondering how this actually ended up in the hands of a movie producer and actually made it to the theaters with such a stellar cast. The plot has always lended itself to making a good movie. But in this effort, Gregory just didn't do well."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Everything I feel about this book has already been said. It is slow moving and riddled with historical inaccuracies. I can forgive the boring writing style, because it is not my type of book. The incorrect facts, however, are harder to ignore. There are very few facts known about Mary Bolyen it shouldn't be too hard to keep them straight. That being said, if the story interests you, read it merely as a work of fiction. Then, get some Alison Weir for the history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Lovers of historical fiction will love this fresh slant on the Tudor Court of Henry VIII with its intrigues and rivalries, which the Boleyn sisters could not escape - ambitious Anne to her tragic end and the gentler Mary to a life of domestic bliss with her husband and the King's bastards."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was a favorite of mine to read because it not only provided me with rich historical references, it was a great storyline told from the point of view of a woman who was not held in the limelight. Rather, Mary Boleyn was an unassuming girl, trying to find her way in the courts of high society, used as a pawn by her parents. It was remarkable seeing the story through the eyes of a bystander.I enjoyed the rich themes of love and loyalty, the contrast between deceit and honor. It made for a thorough read, an interesting tale. The love between the siblings is juxtaposed with their simultaneous violent rivalry. Amidst the brutality, this tale is a story about ambition. Ambition for the Boleyn family in the time of King Henry's court.Read if you love historical fiction. The story gets lengthy and somewhat repetitive towards the middle, but is still an amazing novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I would say that is one of the best book I've ever read. There were so much betrayal, sex, and love all at once that just keep you reading. I couldn't stop myself from putting the book down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading historical literature. Everything in the story is so vividly descripted that it just get you absorbed into the story. The relationship between Mary and her sister Anne and their brother George is unbelievable. You'll have to read the book yourself to fully understand the story behind it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found this book so entertaining. It had the perfect mix of intrigue and historical details. Some historical fiction I've read tends to weigh you down with so many facts and names that the story is lost, but not so here. I felt the writer did a wonderful job of giving the events while sit keeping me totally engrossed in the story. It was one of those that keeps you turning pages into the wee hours of the night - definitely a good read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book and could not put it down. It is readable, entertaining and plausible. I have a particular interest in Ann Boleyn and have read many of the major works (historical and fiction) on Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn. I enjoyed reading about these historical figures from Ms. Gregory's well researched perspective. The rivalry of the Boleyn sisters is riveting and believable. The author brings to life the intense competition within the Howard dynasty and between the leading noble families...the Howards, the Seymours and others. Even though I knew how the book was destined to end, I was eager to turn each page."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was never a big fan of historical books, but I really enjoyed reading this book about the other Boleyn girl. I found myself so fascinated by the story that I researched it further to find out how much was really factual. I would not have thought that a book about snobby English royalty was going to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ended up happy with the ending even though it was much like watching the Titanic movie. You knew how it was going to end, but yet the story in the middle was quite compelling. I switched gears mid-way through the book on my feelings about the main characters. I started out feeling sorry for Anne and jumping for joy at the end when her head fell in the basket. Mary was a great character and I enjoyed the fictional development around her by the writer to really make you feel how she was feeling. It was great. I recommend it if you want to learn something or just to be pleasantly entertained."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The other boleyn was my first reading of a Philippa Gregory, and i couldnt put it down. The story was believeable, never boring and painted a very real visual of life in Henry's Court -- certainly supported that he would not be any womens choice for sound husband material!! I would highly recommend this book, as well as The Queen's Fool. Both were great Elizebethian reads -- Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the first Gregory book I have read- Can't wait to read more. You feel like you are there in Tudor England right along with the characters. The hypocracy and survival of the fittest in life at court are well portrayed. I couldn't put it down!The rivalry between Mary and Anne was riveting as well as Gregory's attention to histrical detail. Even though most people are familiar with the story of Anne Boleyn, this is a fascinating adventure!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am a huge lover of historical fiction, first seduced by the writings of Issac Asimov and more recently the likes of Charles Fraiser, or Stephen Ambrose. Of course, most all of those stories focus primarially on &quot;male issues,&quot; which by virtue of the time period, is usually the subject of war or plight of a particular peoples. Philippa Gregory's novel truly illuminates &quot;female issues&quot; from the persective of a woman who is most representative of her peers. She skillfuly weaves threads, fibers and bolts of corruption, scandal, dysfunction, sorrow, pain, with adornments of love, joy, success, achievement and happiness, to reveal a rich tapestry of societal mores, family dynamics and politics that so obviously define the tenuous and fragile nature of life during the Tudor reign. It is also evident that the subject was well researched to provide an intelligent and sophisticated read. The focus on how women were perceived, valued and utilized, coupled with the prevalence of abuse, neglect, power and control to dictate the lives of Tudor women, even amongst themselves, draws a frightening parallel to the lives of women today. The book is outstanding and will bring pause for reflection to any who read it, and, begs the question, when will we learn from our past?"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Could be your favorite historical fiction novel, if you like to learn about history, certain time periods in a way that's entertaining.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is written through the eyes of Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's sister, who is a courtier of the court. From this viewpoint, the reader is allowed to experience the &quot;whole&quot; Boleyn story. Starting with the relationship between King Henry and his first wife, Katherine of Aragon. Through, the influence Anne Boleyn had over the court, politics, and eventually the Church of England.This book also introduces major historically influencial characters in this time period, and explains about the establishment of the Church of England and the seperation from the Roman Catholic church and why.There is a lot discussion about whether Mary was the elder Boleyn or the younger. Philippa Gregory depicts Mary as the younger Boleyn, which recent studies and theories believe is TRUE. The fact that Anne was sent abroad to study in the French court, while they settled on a suit for Mary, supports the claim that Mary was younger. Also, there is some historical information that the Boleyn's were attempting to marry the eldest daughter, Anne to a suit that would have been beneficial to the Boleyn's. During that time, Mary was married, while they negotiated Anne's marriage. As history can prove, Anne did not marry in that &quot;advantageous&quot; suit, but later married Henry the VIII, as his 2nd wife. The first to be beheaded.Totally mesmorizing, engaging and spellbinding. This ranks as one of my favorite historical fictions. Very well written, and complete."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl tells the notorious story of Henry VIII and his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn, from the perspective of his mistress, Anne's sister Mary Boleyn. The novel begins with the execution of the Duke of Buckingham in 1521 and ends with the execution of Anne Boleyn in 1536. The story itself is rather well known to even casual history readers, but Philippa Gregory makes the story intriguing by telling us what went on behind the scenes.I found this book to be enchanting, enthralling and difficult to put down. As it is put forth as historical fiction, and not a text book, I did not read it with an encyclopedia on hand to detect historical inaccuracies. I don't think that we should negatively critique fiction because of liberties taken with the story. Yes, Gregory puts a decidedly sensationalist construction on the famous story, and her choice to use the lesser known Mary Boleyn as the narrator means that a lot of the story can't be verified. But I didn't care about any of this when I was reading. Instead, I found myself swept away into another time and place - Tudor England was truly brought alive in Gregory's thorough description of the places and atmosphere of England under Henry VIII's rule. It is a riveting story of love, scandal, ambition and sibling rivalry at its worst. I devoured it in a few days and I've already moved on to The Boleyn Inheritance.The best part of the book for me was the fascinating development of Mary Boleyn as a character. At the beginning of the novel she is a slightly idealistic 13 year old girl forced into a marriage and later into an affair with the King of England. Through heartbreak, loss and betrayal, she develops into a courageous woman who makes the choice to rebuff her powerful family and marry a man of her choosing. The scenes between Mary and William Stafford are breathtakingly romantic and beautiful.This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read in a long while. I enjoyed it from beginning to end and recommend it to all historical fiction lovers. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I think I could read this book again and again and never get tired of it. I've enjoyed every Philippa Gregory book, but this is my favorite. It's a tale of two sisters born into one of the most ambitious families in the court of King Henry VIII. Rivals since birth, best friends and worst enemies, their scheming uncle positions them to catch the eye of the king, a calling that leads them in vastly different directions. Full of suspense, sensuality, emotion and delicious detail that recreates a court in which a smile could change your fortune and a whisper could send you to the scaffold."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I used to work for a bookstore and for a while there, this book was flying off the shelves. Big with book clubs. I always considered it a bit too bodice-ripper for my tastes, but when I got a free copy of it a few weeks ago I decided to give it a chance. I'm a fan of the Tudors, and HIGHLY recommend Alison Weir's bio of Queen Elizabeth I. I was definitely pulled along by the twisting plot, but goodness, the dialogue is cheesy. I found myself rolling my eyes many a time. My worry with it is that people will believe it's entirely accurate, when it isn't. Gregory says herself in the endnotes that she's basing some of the plot on theories (about her brother as well as an unfortunate pregnancy) put forward by another historian. Those theories haven't been proven accurate (and in fact there's some proof they're just wrong), but they certainly make for a juicy story. And as another reviewer said, Gregory's characterization of Anne as a cruel woman do not do justice to everything she accomplished. She had serious brains and guts, and yet is made to look like a thoroughly unpleasant person who cared only for ambition. If you're honestly interested in the tale of the Tudors, look to Alison Weir for a fun, interesting, factual read. These people were fascinating enough as it is- fictionalizing them isn't necessary."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read some but, mostly listened to this novel on CD.The narrator was excellent. The problem with listening to a CD is that you can't skim and skip parts . The story went on and on. Despite this, the story is interesting and the characters are well drawn. Th only person I liked was Catherine of Aragon. Both Boleyn girls were treated by their family like whores however; I still didn't like them .Henry the VIIIcame across as a philandererer. I liked the story and learned a great deal about the Boleyn family .Phippa Gregory reminded me of Jean Plaidy who wrote historical novels thirty years ago."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My wife bought this book and I started reading it because I had nothing else to read on an 12 hour overseas plane trip. The subject matter and style of the book is something I definitely wouldn't normally pursue for my own reading, but after reading 100 pages or so, I found myself reluctantly drawn to the story and characters. I'm not in a position to judge its historical accuracy, but I doubt many people pick up this book with this in mind. Basically, it is the story of the English royal court and all the \\"soap opera\\" type intrigue you might expect in such a setting. The prose and the characterizations are simple and laced with some racier details of the main characters' interactions that sometimes made me wandered if I wasn't reading one of those cheap \\"romance\\" novels. It is all too easy to pick apart this novel from a variety of aspects, but after completing the novel, I didn't feel the least bit cheated. It definitely provided me with a sufficient distraction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Pros: An interesting storyline, develops a minor personage in history into a likeable, well fleshed out character.Cons: A bit light on history, some of the characters are one-dimensional.For the first hundred pages or so of this book, I wasn't sure that I was going to like it. The writing is very average most of the time and I wasn't sure that I would like Gregory's sweet, innocent Mary being contrasted with her conniving sister Anne. After a while, the twists and turns of the story began to draw me in.I have read many historical novels, but few have impressed me as much as this one with their ability to keep the reader turning the pages. Perhaps this is because the book is based around the life Mary Boleyn, a figure who does not hold huge significance in history and thus I do not already know everything there is to know about her life. Perhaps it is because the book follows the lives of individuals so closely rather than trying to achieve a more grandiose, \\"epic\\" feel. Part of me feels that I can't turn away from this book for the same reasons that people can't turn away from soap operas -- the relationships, the personal drama, etc. Whatever the reason, this book is certainly an entertaining read. Sometimes, I feel that Gregory is pounding her themes into my head, though Anne's execution echoing the execution at the beginning of the book was a brilliant bit of work.In terms of character, Mary Boleyn is very well developed. In essence, you get to see her grow from an innocent girl to a mature woman who certainly has her faults, but who is loveable all the same. Historically accurate or not, her journey in this book is certainly an uplifting one to read. I wish that I could say that Anne is as well developed, but I cannot. Anne shows promise in the first half of the book, but by the end she has become an utterly predictable, conniving, ambitious little villian. The other characters are mixed. Some, like Mary's Uncle Howard and her parents are utterly one dimensional while others, like Henry VIII, George Boleyn, and Katherine of Aragon show varying degrees of complexity.The book could, perhaps, be more historically accurate, but expecting complete historical accuracy from a fictional novel, especially one marketed like this, is setting yourself up for disappointment. Besides, many of the supposed \\"inaccuracies\\", such as the sister's birth order are at least somewhat debatable. I was more upset that the speech patterns and the general tone and setting did not seem to reveal more of 1500s than I was about any divergence from the actual historical events.In the end, I would say that The Other Boleyn Girl is a step up from historical soap opera -- but only a small step. It is always entertaining, but is truly thrilling much less often. It is vaguely historical and rarely deep, but it makes me want to go out and read a dozen more books on this fascinating period."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was fun to read because it was written from Ann Boleyn's sister's point of view. This was convenient because you get to know Ann Boleyn and George Boleyn and King Henry very well, without the disappointment of having the narrator beheaded. The author portrays the sordid immorality of King Henry, the narrator's craving for family and love, and Ann Boleyn's unstated desire for power and wealth. Obviously, the narrator survives and the evil sister, well, has another well known fate. The vague reasons for Ann Boleyn's death are logically theorized in this book. It's just pretty fun to read and historically accurate, as far as we could know, but it has some kind of sexy scenes in it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I liked the book at first, but it just seemed to drag endlessly in the middle. **SPOILER ALERT** I just got sick of hearing- summer- spent with the kids, god I love them. Fall- Anne's trying to get the king, but it falls through, summer- spent with the kids, god I love them, Fall- Anne's trying to get the king, etc etc. Also, I know she did not want to make Mary look perfect, but there seemed to be an emphasis on she's stupid, she's a whore, but everyone loves her because she is adorable. Anne was evil, manipulative, etc, to the point of being unbelievable or that I just didn't care anymore. The end might have been better than I think, but I found myself skimming it just to get it over with. Anyway, I can see where people would like the book, it just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I must admit, even though I get mad at the differences between movies that are based off of books, I still go see them. Since I was \\"informed\\" by my friend that we would be seeing \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" when the movie comes out, I was determined to work the book into my reading rotation first (because for me the book is ALWAYS better). So, I eventually got it on my reading list, and WOW! I love the book, I was compelled to buy all of the others in the series, and I have absolutely no regrets. I couldn't put this one down, and I thrived on all the drama that Gregory has created. Hey, better in a book than in real life. Oh wait, much of this was real life... :)"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl gives a fascinating glimpse into the court of King Henry VIII. While I struggled with the author's writing style in the beginning (a bit too heavy, repetative, and slow for me) a 100 pages into the book I was gripped by the story. I can't say that I loved any of the characters, but I think that was the author's purpose, to show us the real people of the court, which I found intriguing and realistic (or at least imagined it as real.) I will definitely read more of this author's books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had more or less given up reading historical novels when I ran out of books by Jean Plaidy to read. For me, she was one of the truly rare authours (saving Sharon Kay Penman of course) who got the feel, tone and character of her subject matter right. So that I had more or less stopped looking out for new books in this genre to read. And then I saw \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" at my local bookstore, and after sampling the first chapter, I realized that I had to buy this book. And I'm awfully glad that I did. What a simply wonderful read!! Phillipa Gregory did a really splendid job of evoking the splendor and turbulence of Henry VIII's court. I also thought that her choice of narrator, Mary Boleyn (the elder of the Boleyn sisters) was an inspired as well. Most historians (and perhaps I've only read the those that espoused this majority view) tend to dismiss Mary as an empty headed good time girl because she was used and cast aside with very little ceremony; and because she never rose as high as her sister, Anne. But you have to wonder: Mary was also the only Boleyn sibling to survive the vicissitudes of Henry VIII's reign, and the fall of the Howard-Boleyn fortunes; she also managed to marry for love (and a happy and lasting marriage it proved to be too) the second time around. So perhaps there was a lot more to the 'other Boleyn girl' than everyone credits?Gregory's novel opens and closes with two executions -- it begins with the execution of the Duke of Buckingham in 1521, and ends with the execution of Anne Boleyn in 1536. With this rather grim events framing her book, the novel proper starts in 1522, with Anne arrival at the Tudor court, where her elder sister, Mary, is already lady-in-waiting to Henry's wife, Queen Katherine. From the very beginning we see that while there is a bond that ties the Boleyn sisters together, there is also a deep rooted rivalry between them. It is a tense time at court: the queen (already quite a few years older than her husband) has yet to produce a male heir to the throne, and people are beginning to question if the aging queen will ever be able to bear children again. Some of Henry's advisers are even began to gently hint that he should put his Spanish wife aside and look for a younger more fecund wife. In the midst of all this intrigue, Mary soon catches the king's roving eye. Although she is married and still quite loyal to the queen, her family (her ruthless parents as well as her uncle, the powerful and equally ruthless Duke of Howard) decrees that she put her marriage and loyalties aside and cater to the whims of her king. Bedazzled, it doesn't take Mary very long to fall in love with both her golden king and her role as the his 'unofficial' wife. A few years and two royal by-blows later however, Mary is shunted aside when the king begins to loose interest in their relationship and her ambitious family fearful that they will loose all the power that they have gained, throws the more ruthless and seductive sister, Anne at the king's head. From then on Mary, her eyes finally wide open as to how low her family will stoop in order to gain power, watches from the sidelines as her family, led by Anne, begins their high stakes play for the queen's crown. Finally realizing that she can only depend on herself for her own future, Mary is inspired to take a few risks herself in order to gain some measure of happiness and security.The sheer scope of this novel is gigantic -- there were so many things that were going on both on and off stage and the number of people that were involved in all these shenanigans! So that it was a treat to find that the novel unfolded smoothly and effortlessly, and that Gregory did not drop the ball once. She kept each chapter short and succinct, and yet still managed to give the reader an enthralling and exciting account of what was going on. I also liked the manner in which she depicted all the characters in this novel. From Queen Katherine who was portrayed not only as a loyal and loving wife, but also as an intelligent woman who saw and understood what was going on around her, even as she clung to the hope that the king would recover from his obsession with Anne; to the authour's chilling portrayal of the Boleyn family (father, mother, Anne and George). With a few well chosen words and phrases, she's paints them as wildly ambitious, ruthless and pettily cruel individuals, willing to use each other in order to achieve a particular goal. But the authour's characterization of Mary Boleyn was probably the best thing in the novel. Here we see a young and intelligent woman with a heart and a sense of morality that is constantly at war with her feeling of familial obligations. How Mary struggles with this dueling feelings and the decisions she makes -- sometimes good, sometimes bad -- is what makes this novel worth reading.All in all, I'd say \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a rich and rewarding read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl, is hands down the best piece of historical fiction I have ever read. Upon reading it, I have been searching for other books of its genre and subject matter to delve into.Gregory made these characters come alive for me, and made me understand how difficult it was to live as a woman in the early 1500s. Mary was especially well crafted. At 13 years old she went from her forced marriage to being thrown into the King's arms as his mistress. The inner struggles she fought between being true to herself and her heart, or true to her family were especially poignant.Anne Boleyn, the most famous and tragically terminated sister, is portrayed in such a venomous way. She would stop at nothing to get what she wanted, and to rise in power and prestige. In the end it killed her. But her character, as portrayed by Ms. Gregory, was compelling and convincingly ugly, despite her beauty.King Henry VIII also jumped off the pages. He came off as a spoiled brat, even as he grew older, who always got what he wanted. He and Anne were well matched for each other as no level of deceipt was too high.Ms. Gregory was brilliant in choosing Mary as the narrator of this book. In doing so, the manipulative and scheming nature of Anne was able to come alive, as was the unorthodox lifestyle chosen by George Boleyn, the brother. The relationship amongst the Boleyn siblings, in and of itself, could fill a novel. The complexities of a family struggling to maintain individual identities, while working to bring the family up to the highest level of stature is intense.This book is a page turner; it is incredibly compelling, deep and fascinating. I learned a great deal about the monarchy of Henry VII as well as life in the court during that time period. At the same time, I found myself incredibly entertained and saddened when I reached the last page. I cannot wait for more from Ms. Gregory."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of Tudor England. I am also a fan of reading, particularly historical fiction. My favorite subject would be, of course, Anne Boleyn, the Boleyn family, and her friends. I heard that The Other Boleyn Girl was chronicling Mary Boleyn, the relatively unknown sister of Anne, and I was undoubtedly excited. I've always thought of Mary as the less succesful sister, the foolish one, who enjoyed the bodily pleasures and failed in her ambitions(there being overwhelming evidence to support this), as opposed to the witty, intelligent, wordly and ambitious Anne who was spirtually adept and not neccisarily a physical being. I, of course have read books where Anne was not all of these and still enjoyed them so don't think my intense admiration for Anne is coloring my review.Let me start off with the basics; Characterization. Gregory apparently skipped this class-or at least was asleep for the majority of it. All of her characters are two-deminsional-at best. Let's start with the protagonist-Mary. For no reason whatsoever Mary has grown up superior to her family...despite the fact that she had no outside influence to change this. She never mentions a mentor who taught her her values and moral superiority,she is not particularly religious,she merely is better-something that goes intensly against human nature. Mary's intentions are soley good all the time, she just wants to be with her beautiful children and escape her evil family. I suppose her good nature was supposed to leave me on pins and needles just hoping she gets that beautiful happily ever after-in fact, it had the exact opposite effect. I found Mary's troubles superficial in comparision to those around her, the majority of whom where sincerely better people with causes they were dedicated to. Mary was simply self involved to the point of making me nauseous. When her sister gives birth to a girl who is apparently-and innacuratly- unloved whom is apparently her sisters downfall(again, innacurately)-and what is Mary's thought process? She is not concerned for her sister who is now treading down the road to execution, not for the King she once loved who is bitterly dissapointed in the woman he love not being what he expected, and not even for the poor baby girl-but for herself. She tells her husband that she can't believe she's going to have to wait for another pregnancy to \\"escape\\". When Jane Seymour is slowly taking Anne's place as Queen at court, and Anne is understandbly saying how much she wishes she was dead, Mary returns with a \\"Anne that is so horrible\\". What? What is Anne supposed to feel? Jane certainly wanted Anne dead. No one around her is good enough for Mary, and her morality seemed to grate on my nerves. At one point she threatens suicide to her sister-and I was half hoping she would actually go through with it to end this narcissisticly schreeching, whiny narration.Anne, I am supposed to gather, was the exact opposite of her wonderful sister. This wonderful, intelligent, witty and albiet ambitious woman is reduced to a pure evil caraciture. There are no limits to her evil, everything about her is cruel, she doesn't hesitate in way before committing the most henious acts, with none of the basic human emotion of regret. Turn to any given page and there is an example of her evilness. There is not one nice thing said about Anne in this book. Even on the eve of her execution she doesn't seem to want to repent anything. Why would Henry literally turn church and state on its head for this woman, one might ask? Good question, and I'm still trying to figure it out. Anne had many, many, many admirers because she was a very attractive, intelligent and generally pleasing being. She may have had moments of cruelty, though so has everyone, but that does not mean they are a one-deminsional harpy with little thought above how she can advance herself. Even though Gregory, I'm gathering, wanted me to hate her, I really only loved her simply becuase she was different than that whiny protagonist.The other characters are equally unbelievable. Thomas and Elizabeth Boleyn were certainly ambitious, but I doubt they were this careless when it came to their children. Ambition does not equal recklessly evil, though I got the feeling that this is what the moral of this story was supposed to be. Henry had no depth whatsoever, and was constantly WHINING! He was King of England, he really need not whine so much. William Stafford is supposed to be the ideal, supportive man who is deeply commited to Mary-for God knows why- and he is basically a characticature. George Boleyn is either doing two things-hanging around his sister's bedchamber or cavorting with his male lover. Katherine of Aragon was-historically speaking-certainly a wronged woman, but I have trouble believing she was so unhumanly saintly. This really isn't the only book that does this-authors who are sympathetic to Katherine tend to make her out-of-this-world Godly. Katherine was a human being, with flaws just like the rest of us-I'd love to see some of them sometime.Now the laundry list of historical errors:Mary Boleyn spent many years at the French Court, where she had quite the reputation of being permiscuous(the King of France called her \\"my English mare\\" becuase he \\"rides her so often\\"), and sent home in disgrace because of it. She was probably the older sister(and five or so years older than this), but if she was not, Anne would probably be three or four years older, becuase Mary would hardly be sleeping around at 11. Mary was Henry's mistress for perhaps two years, and her children were not his. Anne and Henry Percy did not connsummate their engagement-it would have been impossible to break. The Boleyn \\"family meetings\\" probably did not happen-Anne and Mary probably both made their way to the King's bed on their own, seeing as how Mary had done it before and Anne staunchly resisted his advances for a year before becoming emotionally-though not physically-involved. Mary probably didn't even consider Katherine of Aragon's feelings-mistresses in Kings were considered common, and if a King did not have one he was considered weak. Mary was hardly cast aside with nothing, she was given all the favors of a royal mistress. Anne's cruelty to Mary Tudor and Katherine has been overexaggerated for hundreds of years-she was indifferent at worst to them both. Fisher and More were executed in that order, how could that not get past an editor? Anne loved Elizabeth fiercly and intensly, and did not neglect her in the wet nurses' chamber, but insisted on breast feeding. Anne's miscarraige of a deformed baby and George's homosexuality were taken directly from Retha Warnicke's biography, which is perfectly fine, but Warnicke's main theory is the discounting of Chapuys as an accurate source, who has been the major source to prove to people that she was evil. She uses undeniable evidence to prove this, and yet Gregory did clearly did not use this, so she either only read the parts that sounded cool to her, or simply skimmed the back. Mary Boleyn was banished from court and then begged for years to be allowed back, she did not make a stealthy escape, and she never comes back, not even when her siblings are rotting in the Tower. Anne was a surpisingly liberal Queen,and saved hundreds upon hundreds from the Inquosition, something Gregory conviently forgets-she also donated thousands of pounds to charity-which is equivalant to millions nowadays. Not one heretic was burned while Anne was Queen, although hunreds were burned before and hundreds after. Anne saved both Catholics and Protestants from the burning post. And for GOD'S SAKE; Anne did not commit incest!!!! She swore \\"upon the damnation of mine own mortal soul\\" that she did not, evenwhen she didn't neccisarily have to. No one seriously believes Anne commited adultery, or was a witch, and absolutely no one believes she had sex with her brother. Why does Gregory feel the need to include this? I'm willing to bet the vast majority were hating Anne at this point anyways, so including charges she was certianly innocent of was just plain disrepectful. And there were so many, many more.After reading all of this, I was naturally inflamed, but after reading the interview in the back I was half ready to hunt Gregory down and accuse her of incest with her brother. She says things like \\"historians are divided as to whether the charges actually took place\\" Um...no they are not. I think Gregory is the first person to insist that they could be true in a hundred years. \\"Anne was not a woman who let morals get in her way\\" This is a strange sentence, and also patenly false. All of the sources listed in Gregory's \\"bibliography\\" have varying degrees of respect for Anne, and Alison Weir clearly does not like her, but even the ones who do not think she was a Godly creature insist that she did have morals and virtues. Gregory also insists \\"Anne was clearly guilty of one murder\\" What?! I have no idea what she is talking about here, genuinely no idea. She insists that there is evidence that she tried to poison Fisher. This evidence is a rumour that started contemporarily, in which Anne sent a messanger to him to tell him to avoid Parliment should he become sick. This is a rumor, and Weir is perhaps the only historian who believes it. Gregory says the broad facts of Mary's life are true in the novel-of which they are not. She discounts every other type of fiction and constantly toots her own horn. She says it's perfectly reasonable that Anne would have commited incest with her brother to getting pregnant and that George would be the \\"obvious choice\\". It's an odd world when your brother is the obvious choice for getting pregnant. Anne had many admirers who would die for her (Thomas Wyatt \\"Whoso List to Hunt\\" for example), and if she were to take a lover(which she didn't) I would say that she had many to chose from. Also, the common knowledge of that time was that women were responsible for miscarraiges and the sex of babies. If she was miscarrying, she would have certainly thought it was her fault, and taking a lover would not help.I would give it zero stars if I could. Please pass this one up. But if you simply cannot refrain, I suggest buying either Warnicke, Bruce's, or Ive's biography and read it first, just to laugh at how ridiculous Gregory is."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I can say in all honesty this is the worst book I have read in many years; I wish I could rate it \\"one-quarter star.\\" I only finished the book because I was on a 14-hour flight across the Pacific Ocean with nothing else to do. The writing is of extraordinarily poor quality, aimed at about a 6th-grade reading level. Worse, it seeks to make the heroine seem better than she was by degrading every other female around, particularly female family members. The main target for her vitriol is Anne Boleyn, who is portrayed as a psychotic monster (who eagerly has a long-term affair with her own brother, an accusation that no one else seriously believes). The author's twisted hatred makes one wonder if the author has a sister she hates, or possibly she hates all women on the planet and blames them for all her own personal problems.The book portrays Mary as a sweet innocent, the only good woman in England. In reality, Mary Boleyn was sent as a young girl to the French court as a lady in waiting. She became a notorious international laughingstock because of her extreme promiscuity and lack of common sense and was brought home in disgrace. Her horrible reputation as beyond \\"easy,\\" as well as her extreme youth and stupidity, temporarily appealed to Henry VIII. He used her, got her pregnant, and instantly forgot her existence. It was her bad example that caused Anne to hesitate so long before giving in to Henry.The bad writing gets truly laughable in the \\"sexy\\" scenes and later scenes showing Mary \\"playing house\\" - - finding true happiness as the poor farmer's wife, with a smile on her face and a song in her heart in her jolly, neat little cottage, having fun learning to cook and clean and milk the cows - - at a time when a real, impoverished farmwife would be doing backbreaking work 14 hours a day, fighting for survival. How about a reality check here! In fact, one of the reasons I picked the book up in the first place was because I was hoping for some factual information on Mary's later marriage - - I know she married a commoner, not a wealthy man, but how poor were they? I assume he was a gentleman farmer with servants. It seems incredible that a member of the aristocracy would gladly and merrily move to a life of poverty, which would involve extreme hardship and not the fun and games the author stupidly portrays. If Mary really married a poor man and had to do all the work, it would have been a horrifying and shocking learning experience on her part, true culture shock, and not the joyful romp portrayed in this silly book.All in all, this is a ridiculous and offensive book, insulting to anyone with intelligence and to any woman with any self respect."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The author lost my interest right off the bat when she proclaimed Mary to be the younger Boleyn girl. All historical sources agree that she was the elder daughter. That doesn't really matter to the story, so why not get it right? I was also annoyed by the portrayal of Mary as an innocent young girl when she first met Henry VIII...in fact, she had previously been the mistress of Francois I of France and had been kicked out of the French court for prostitution, which is why she returned to England while Anne remained in France. When Mary arrived at the English Court, an innocent she was NOT. I found the author's portraits of all 3 Boleyn children to be biased in the direction she wanted them to go, as opposed to being realistic based on the historical data available. The author was prone to conveniently leaving out facts that were relevant to the story but did not support her simplistic view of each character. Anyone who has read historical accounts of these characters and times will be severely disappointed in this book. I only hope that the general public does not mistake this book for history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Upfront, I must confess: I never read popular fiction, don't care for romance novels, and love classical and modern literature. I read 'War and Peace' at age eleven, and as an adolescent, devoured Balzac, Zola, Galsworthy, Hugo, the 'Odyssey' and 'Iliad', Emily Bronte, and a great deal of nonfiction, mostly history.I read TOBG out of curiosity, being a historian (specialties: Anne Boleyn's early years in the Renaissance courts of Margaret of Austria/France and how they affected her notions of queenship/monarchy; her lost portraits - reassessing a lost image). After forty years of formal (advanced degrees) and informal research, I feel compelled to write a review.What a disaster: I have no idea how this travesty was foisted upon an unsuspecting public with such extraordinary success.Let me begin by stating PG is a technically impoverished 'writer'. TOBG is rife with errors: grammatically incorrect sentences, missing commas, changes in point of view from first to third person omniscient; characters exit scenes in which they did not appear in the first place. Moreover, the 'style' - if one can call it that - is simplistic, clich&eacute; ridden, and without distinction. Modern idioms; telling, not showing; passive writing - all sins in 'Creative Writing 101', which most learn in grade school.Regarding character: PG resorts to stereotypical and old fashioned views of women: the bad (assertive/dark) girl meets a horrific end, and the good (passive/fair) girl is rewarded with true love. All rather ridiculous. What we now call the \\"Madonna/whore\\" complex. Mary Boleyn is the perfect lover, mother, wife, even tempered, wise, but delightfully sweet and alluringly innocent; whereas Anne Boleyn is a vicious, arrogant, not very bright, sour, manipulative, shallow, vulgar female dog, given to physical altercations. The latter's professions of being in love with Henry Percy? Impossible to believe.Katherine of Aragon, too, is portrayed as a one-dimensional character, noble and proud. Clich&eacute;. Curiously, Henry VIII is passive and easily duped by any pretty face; reduced to little more than a plot device, without a distinct personality.Beyond the above, I am deeply troubled by PG's deliberate distortion of history, and even more so by her constant insistence of erring on the side of historical facts, not fiction. This Anne Boleyn is utterly unrecognizable to me as a historian - what a slanderous, vicious, assault on a dead person. Like anyone, Anne Boleyn was a three dimensional character: brilliant, intellectual, an able politician, exceptionally loyal to family and friends, dignified, highly educated, elegant, culturally accomplished, known for her cheerful and spirited nature. But under stress, as during the protracted annulment and as queen, became short tempered, aggressive, overly intense and passionate.Of Mary Boleyn we know virtually nothing. However, PG (in a video interview) confessed to admiring her for bravely following her heart and marrying for love over her horrible family's objections. A modern perspective, a misreading of sixteenth century court mores and standards of behaviour - something she often does. PG claims there is no solid evidence for Mary's reputation for promiscuity at the French court, which I find bizarre. Franois I recalled Mary as \\"una grandissima ribalda, et infame sopra tutte\\", which PG downplays/denies. Anne Boleyn and the family assisted Mary as much as possible, but her rash behaviour was perceived as a major embarrassment. Henry VIII was not amused to have, as brother in law, someone from the obscure gentry.Other errors:The Boleyn - Howard family never pushed either sister into Henry VIII's bed; horrifying thought. Boleyns always MARRIED well, and virginity was paramount - any whisper of 'reputation' decreased an entire family's stock. Hence, Mary marrying William Carey, a minor noble after her disgrace in France, and it being highly improbable, even impossible, Anne Boleyn consummated her relationship with Henry Percy. Too great a risk for someone with great presence of mind.Anne Boleyn was the younger of the sisters, born c. 1501; Mary was born c. 1499 or 1500. Evidence? Anne Boleyn's first letter in French, assisted by Semmonet/Symmonet, a male tutor in the household of Margaret of Austria, which is in a mature hand; Lord Hunsdon, Mary Boleyn's grandson, supplicated Elizabeth I for the Ormonde title on the basis of Mary being the elder - to which Elizabeth, significantly, did not object.Henry Carey was not Henry VIII's son, born several years after Mary's affair with Henry VIII; Catherine Carey, the elder child, might have been Henry VIII's, but it is highly unlikely. The affair has been pushed further back into the early 1520s, shortly after her marriage (1520).Anne Boleyn never \\"stole\\" Mary's son, but rather, arranged a good education for him after his father's death in 1528. The paltry 100 stipend Anne Boleyn obtained for Mary is actually closer to 50,000 today. Hardly poor. And Stafford also received an income.Catherine Carey did not attend Anne Boleyn before the latter's death.Perhaps most disconcerting is PG's reliance on Dr. Retha Warnicke's legitimate historical revisionism, which has not passed the test of time. Revisionist history is best left to scholarly debate, not used as the basis of a bodice ripper romance novel. To her credit, Dr. Warnicke has vocally and publicly distanced herself from PG.George Boleyn, an avowed homosexual, in love with a man, lusting after his sister, committing incest? What? There is no evidence for a deformed foetus, incest, witchcraft, etc. in the historical record.I looked at her 'bibliography': shoddy. Outdated (Bruce - 1972), controversial (Warnicke), negative (Weir - not a historian, and unreliable), general and/or anachronistic works. Elton and Bindoff? I remember these as a first year undergrad. I suspect she skimmed the sources, and not actually read them. PG is no historian, despite protesting otherwise. Where is Dr. Eric Ives (1986)? Hugh Paget's watershed article (1981)? Only secondary sources, no primary?As for the charges, adultery by a queen was not a capital offense/treason: Anne Boleyn was accused of plotting the King's death, to ostensibly marry one of her 'lovers' after. These charges were deliberately constructed to impugn her moral character.To give weight to these ridiculous charges, as PG does, is utterly irresponsible. Cromwell and Anne Boleyn, both able politicians, were engaged in a bitter struggle over Church revenues and foreign policy. She would have struck him down, had he not struck first. The charges were sloppy and concocted in great haste - none of the dates and places matched; Henry VIII's behaviour remained curiously passive throughout, an element that puzzles historians even now. Not even Chapuys, the Imperial ambassador and Anne Boleyn's sworn enemy, believed a single charge.\\"Most people think the trial was a show trial, but it is an interesting accusation. Anne had three miscarriages by the time of her trial, and she was not a woman to let something like sin or crime stand in her way - she was clearly guilty of one murder. I think if she had thought that Henry could not bear a son she was quite capable of finding someone to father a child on her. If she thought that, then George would have been the obvious choice.\\"How grammatically incomprehensible! Three miscarriages? Three pregnancies. Not let sin or crime stand in her way? Slander; Anne Boleyn was deeply religious, in the New Faith. Clearly guilty of one murder? Not a shred of evidence. \\"If Henry could not bear a son\\" [sic]? Did I miss that possibility in biology? George, the obvious choice?Why this hatred of Anne Boleyn? Is PG a Catholic in the tradition of Sander, the one who created the six fingers myth during Elizabeth's reign? Well, she at least did not include that, for which deserves one star."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory seems to want to take up right where Anne Boleyn's detractors left off and accuse her of the worst possible, and then add on top of that a one-dimensional portrayal in a wildly sensationalist and inaccurate book.Many of the inaccuracies have already been pointed out. In historical fiction, a little liberty with the facts is fine--how else are we to get into the characters' heads?--but in this case lack of research shows a gaping plot hole: why on earth would Henry drop the younger, fertile sister for the aging one if he was so fixated on having an heir? Evidence is marginal and sketchy at best that George was homosexual (bisexual, perhaps) and it's fairly commonly thought that the incest charges were just to turn public opinion against Anne.My issue, other than the historical, is that the characters are so flat. We are told, rather than shown, over and over again, that Mary and Anne are rivals; yet Anne switches from slightly shrewish to ungodly annoying at the drop of a hat, with never a swerve into the tender sister Mary supposedly loves.And what of Anne the Queen? Just as we could dig into the relationship between these two sisters--what Mary thinks of Anne's reign, the implications Anne's Lutheran sympathies have for the Howards/Boleyns--Mary is conveniently distracted by a trite flirtation with William Stafford.May I recommend Alison Weir for accurate representation of this court?"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I cannot believe so many people love this book, despite that it has been recommended to me by many people.The first 200 pages read like this...OVER and OVER: As family meetings occur that predictably decide the current course/path to keep the Boleyn throne-happy goals on target, Mary Boleyn continually observes and is continually mystified by the horrible regard her family has for her own feelings. Anne Boleyn is continually portrayed as this one dimensional ambitious snake who is nearly solely behind and guiding Henry vIII's ultimate decision to denouce his marriage (hardly plausible), and every scene about the entire court catering to the king is played over and over in the same predictable manner: We all get that everyone kisses the king's you-know-what. I kept wondering, should I just've skipped a hundred pages?With such interesting subject matter, better character development wouldve been a good start for the author.I am in total shock that this book is as loved as it is. Yet again more evidence that people just enjoy the likes of today's manufactured steamy celeb gossip style prose."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It wasn't the historical background that irritated me, that was quite well researched and believable in its rendering of daily life in Tudor England. What bugged the crap out of me was the characters and their motivations. The overall tone of this book was that of a particularly bad romance novel. Henry VIII's most dominant trait was selfishness, both as a King and a man, and yet here we see him portrayed as a tender and devoted lover. I was near to gagging before I was half way through this book. It takes an awfully bad book to make me not finish it, but I came close to launching this one out the window. It went to the book exchange so fast that Phillippa Gregory's head is probably still spinning."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This woman knows absolutely nothing about the politics Tudor period, and it shows. She has Henry still claiming Katharine as his wife when from the moment the annulment trial was convened her official title in England was Princess Dowager; she has More and Fisher excuted in the wrong order (this is more important than it sounds); Henry Carey was never acknowledged as the king's illegitimate son; she has several wrong dates, birthdates and Catholic/Protestant terms; apparently absolutely nothing else was happening in England outside of the king's bed. Highly soap-opera but not history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The book was very well written and kept my interest until it was completed.

She tells her story from the point of view of Mary, Anne's sister, who is referred to as \\"the other Boleyn girl\\". Mary and Anne are depicted as true products of the Howard and Boleyn families, enemies when in competition for the same thing and allies when there is a threat to them and their family. They do the bidding of their elders who only care about advancing the family power and fortune. Their parents are cold and uncaring and their uncle is calculating and willing to sacrifice his nieces for his own gain. Anne is groomed to be the King's mistress during his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, with the hope of succeeding her as queen. Instead she is supplanted by her own sister, Anne, and is betrayed by her family and by the king. The court of Henry VIII is portrayed as a dangerous place, with shifting loyalties and alliances, and every man out for his own profit. Even though the reader knows the final outcome of Anne's story, author Gregory manages to make it a suspenseful climax."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was an incredible book. I have never read anything like this, and found it refreshing. My only complaint about the book is that for such a long-winded story (which I think is necessary in this book), she breezes over some things that left me confused. The book is so long that she should have found a way to remind the reader of who a character was from 500 pages ago. I would recommend this book to anyone. Also, this is a great book club book because there are book club questions in the back."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"There is quite a bit of raunchy in this one.

Gives you more details and makes you understand the time in history better. I highly recommend this book for leisure reading."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you missed the beautiful film, \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\", its probably because you were born after 1969, the year of the film, and watch videos on DVD (the film has only been released on VHS). The film, a historical piece, is a treasure, illustrating with some historical inaccuracy the schism between the Catholic church and the throne of England, which fathered the Reformation and the rise of the Church of England. To think that it was all caused by a fiery young girl that the King (Henry VIII) simply had to have, in the belief that she would bear him a son.Richard Burton shines in the role of Henry VIII, and makes you believe that the women in his life all married him for reasons other than queenship. He creates unbelievable chemistry with the then unknown young actress, Genevieve Bujold, who went on to some success in Hollywood in the next decade. She is bewitching as Anne, and gives one of the finest speeches on film ever made by a woman, when she vents her anger and fear at Henry in the tower before her death, and pledges that her daughter will become a great leader one day (Elizabeth I); a vision that came true.Phillipa Gregory may have been inspired by that film, because her Anne (in a secondary role in this story of Mary Boleyn)is just as conniving, feisty and beautiful as was Bujold's. She captivates all of the court, but her need for power (encouraged by the grasping Boleyn & Howard families) and lust for vengeance at a lost love turn her from the center of the kingdom to one of its most despised residents.Gregory's genius in writing her tale is point of view - that of Mary Boleyn, who was spurned by the king after giving birth to two of his children out of wedlock. Mary is a complicated woman who learns what Anne cannot; that happiness is more important than position in life. Gregory completely holds the reader's interest through good times for the Boleyns and bad, and populates the tale with strong characterization of supporting players, particularly Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first queen.George Boleyn, Uncle Howard, Wolsley the Cardinal, Jane Seymour,William Carey and Mary's children are all convincingly drawn, and Gregory makes it hard to know where fact ends and fiction begins, so compelling is her rationalization of the events that played out on the world's stage.The character of Jane Parker, George's wife, is perhaps the only false or shallow note -- too vapid to be believed.What a wonderful tale and a wonderful author! It will hold your interest, despite its length, and you'll remember it as every bit as well written as the historical fiction given us by Jean Plaidy some years earlier.Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I've read other books by Phillipa Gregory and like them, but I was very disappointed in this one. I love British history but this one contained too much focus on the sexual explorations of the main characters. Okay, I know Mary Boleyn had affairs, but I honestly don't need to read about how the king excites her nor about she and William sneak off every chance they can to have sex all night long. I don't need to hear descriptions of sexual intimacy that includes everything but \\"doing the deed.\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book at the behest of a friend. She said it was wonderful, and how she could not put it down. I could not put it down either, but that is just because I wanted to finish it as fast as I could to end up the torture. I found the fictional part all over, but in it's 672 pages the only historical part I was able to find were some names of people and places. I have read several books about Tudor England, and I would love to know where she got her sources, since she seems to be the only person to have come up with this theory. I wonder why!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I will preface this by saying that I love anything to do with Anne Boleyn, but I have a very low tolerance for books that disregard historical facts. That said, I'll start my review. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be very entertaining. However, I did not like the author's portrayal of Anne. Mary seems to be the perfect character with no flaws while Anne is made out to be a terrible sister. It shouldn't have been that black and white, since life has no black and white. I also didn't like the fact that the author used the idea that Anne resorted to incest in order to get a child. This fact made Anne actually guilty of the crimes she was accused of. The author did not need to do that. The fact that Anne had a fake trial is so much more fascinating and mouth dropping, it really doesn't need any more drama. The Tudor period is so full of it, I found this just to be put in for shock value. From all of the books I've read by Gregory, I think that Gregory has a low opinion of both Anne and her daughter Elizabeth, so I'm not surprised she made Anne out to be such a vicious woman. However, she has no compassion for Anne at all and I found I was frustrated towards the end that she tried to put as much drama and shock value as she could into the novel. That said, if you're interested in an entertaining read, I would recommend this novel. Despite the fact that I disagreed with her view of Anne did not keep me from enjoying the book. Although Gregory may not be the most historically accurate author around, she does know how to tell a story that will keep you hooked until the very end. Just a warning to look things up before you take them as truth."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is one of the BEST novels I have ever read.Philippa Gregory takes you back in time and make you feel the story as if it were your own. From Anne Boleyn's sisters perspective, you really get an amazing feel of what happened and what could have happened with King Henry the 8th.You fall in love with the main characters and this writer never fails to draw you in and make you in tune with the emotions and themes of the story.A serious page turner, The other Boleyn Girl will not disappoint. It give complete satisfaction in every way. This writer makes everything feel real and that you are living in the time period she so amazingly recreates.I would recommend this book to many, along with the rest of her enchanting novels, anyone who loves a captivation and historical story will not be able to put this mischievous story down.Philipa Gregory is Genius"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Literary critics will point out that Gregory's style is not based upon her literary prowess and descriptions. Gregory is able to engage the reader with a solid voice with the main character Mary Boleyn to the infamous Anne Boleyn. The heroine, Mary has her faults and her positive traits that allows her to be a well rounded character.She is thrust into the bed of King Henry the VIII after it is learned that the Queen and him fear they will never bear a male heir. You will notice that Gregory excels at displaying the status of women as pawns during this time period through Mary's explanation of events. She was recently married to a courtier, but it hardly mattered as the Boleyn and Howard family (Mary's mother belonged to the powerful Howard family) cared first and foremost about their advancement in the court and their female daughters were merely pawns in this game.Mary falls in love with the King, but everything goes awry. She gives him two children, but King Henry is fickle and starts to lose interest when the family throws Anne into the mix ensuring that he keeps himself interested in a Boleyn girl, any Boleyn really.What happens after the failed extra marital affair is where the story truly begins. Mary at one point attempts to rekindle her relationship with her husband, but the fates have other plans in store for her. When she finally finds love, it becomes one of the best moments in the novel. He is simple, stoic, neither flashy nor grand and offers Mary the one thing she desires most and that is independence and an identity, which she wasn't afforded being a Boleyn sister.It's difficult to see how Mary wants to be loyal to the Queen, but is forced to betray her due to the hold that her family has on her. Even her depiction of Anne's ascension to the throne is enough to make one shudder. The historical theories that are inserted are believable and the historical setting is seen as a backdrop, a detail, not something to become fixated and lecture the reader on. Any event of significance or social custom is slyly introduced so that the flow of the story is not broken.This book is a must read for historical readers, readers who seek a strong female voice (with flaws mind you), and those who mistakenly saw the movie, before reading the book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The point of view of Mary Boleyn is unique. The viperous political backstabbing within her own family, and the protituting of daughters by their own father is something the modern generation finds unthinkable. The clear, blind ambition of Anne, and the cowardice of George are in direct opposition to Mary's quiet nature. Uncle Howard (The Duke of Norfolk) is comparable to Rasputin in his manipulations. A great read, and leaves you with a yen for more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Having been on an 'anything Tudor' kick lately, I decided it was finally time to remove this book from my wish list and give it a go. I'm certainly glad I did...it was very entertaining, yet at the same time, a bit exhausting. The Boleyn family's never-ending pursuit of Henry was riveting and tiresome all at the same time. Even though I of course knew how the story ended, I too was ready to rid myself of Anne, and I could absolutely understand Henry's need to be done with her...for good. I had zero sympathy for her considering all the terrible things she did to others on the road to becoming the Queen.Now, as far as Mary goes, I really liked her. She did everything she was told to do, but managed to keep her heart, soul, and compassion for others...very unlike her sister who would plow over anyone who stood in her way. Mary was a breath of fresh air to Anne's heavy and turbulent personality.Overall, I really enjoyed the book. I do think that it could have been trimmed down about 100-150 pages though. While vivid descriptions of scenery and clothing are a very good thing, some things just went on and on. In the end I would absolutely recommend this book as well as read another Philippa Gregory novel. In fact, I've already added a few of them to my wishlist. She's a very talented author and has managed to put an interesting spin on a story that's been told many, many times before."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" - I thought it was fast-paced and interesting, I enjoyed the plot line and the characters, and I like Gregory's writing style. That being said - I liked this book for its entertainment value, not for its historical accuracy. While it's not that the book is wildly inaccurate, its also just not the most reliable fiction book out there in terms of what happened to Anne Boleyn and what kind of person Mary Boleyn was. Read this book if you want something to entertain, interest and amuse you, if you want to learn about Henry VIII and his court, read Alison Weir."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. I seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better. I finished reading it then started reading it all over again. This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on, and I never bore of it. And to think I owe it all to this book! It's from Mary Boleyn's point of view. You will see her challanges as well as Anne and the rest of their family. You will feel like your right there at court with them. It's an exciting and fearful time at the court of Henry VIII. It is also very accurate and I highly recommend it. Its one of Phillippa Greggory's better books. I've read all her books and this one is by far her best work. You will fall in love with the Tudor era if your not already."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I will tell you what everyone who read this book told me...I am not a history buff, I have never been into historical fiction and especially history about the European kings, queens and thier courts. But, I loved this book and had the most difficult time putting it down. It is excellently written, the characters are amazing, and the book is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Don't miss out on this book. I am researching to see what books I can read that are like this one! I just can't think of anyone who would not enjoy this book. Because I loved it, and I hated learning about that genre, then anyone would love it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Usually I am not into historical reads but this book was passed on to me. For those of us who dislike being bogged down with history this is a must read. It was a very contemporary read and the characters seemed very real to me.It did take me a chapter or two to get me hooked but once I got going I was unable to put it down.Thanks to Philippa Gregory who has taught me a bit more about history, she is a fantastic author!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was wonderful from start to finish. The characters came alive and seemed very real. A difficult book to put down as the story was always in my mind when I was not reading. During this very difficult time of war and uncertainty it was a welcome escape from the real world. The only disappointment for me was that the book ended. I would have loved to follow Mary's life after she left the court, as well as her children's lives. I'm hoping this is the first in another trilogoy!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"&quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; by Philippa Gregory is amazing. It's over six hundred pages long, but not one page of it was dull (like most long books turn out to be). I felt like I was right there experiencing everything with Mary and her siblings. It's hard to describe such a beautiful book in less than a thousand words. Just buy it. You won't regret it, I promise."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book happened to catch my eye in a bookstore one afternoon. I had never read anything regarding British Historical fiction, so I wasnt sure what to expect. However, once I began this book I could not put it down! It is wonderful. Now, I love reading about Henry VIII and his six wives. It has opened a new love of the subject."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is one of the best historical novels I have ever read. Couldn't put it down! If you like English history and a great read - don't hesitate - this book is a sure-fire winner."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A few years ago I read one of Philipa Gregory's earlier novels, \\"Wideacre\\" and was quite caught up with the way she writes and tells her story. I came upon this book by chance and picked it up right away. I loved it to say the very least! The story of the unknown sister of Anne Boleyn was intriguing and the detailed description of that unmistakeable rivalry between sisters was excellently captured. I loved reading it and recommend this to anyone's who was interested enough to drop by.It's great!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is the opposite of what is usually told about Mary Boleyn. I think this book might be a bit complicated for those who have not read any material before concerning Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn, Henry VII, etc. But other than that I could barely put the book down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a page turner! I couldn't put the it down. If you love historical fiction, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"An interesting take on the Boleyn family, narrated by Anne's lesser know sister, Mary. In this telling of the story, Mary is depicted as the younger sister, which I found interesting as most historical accounts list her as being the older. A quick and enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is wonderful. I couldn't put it down. Now I want to read everything I can about that period, and I wonder if there are other books about Mary Boleyn. Great book! Sorry I missed the movie, but I'll get it on DVD."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"From the very first page of this 660 page book I was hooked. And I couldn't stop reading it until it was finished. That's saying a lot because I considered this book and its popularity a little too lightweight for my current tastes. I was wrong. I loved it. The author captured the court of Henry VIII perfectly. The splendor and the over-indulgence and the excesses and intrigues that had formerly felt like the dry facts of history now came alive.Henry VII was married to Katherine of Aragon. Although she had given him a daughter, Mary, she did not give him a son. She was aging and he wanted to remarry. The Church would not let him do this and so he changed the religion of England forever in order to marry Anne Bolyen who he later had beheaded. According to the plot of this book, Mary Bolyen was Anne Bolyen's younger sister who had an affair with King Henry VIII before the king was smitten with the famous Anne. There is some history that supports this claim and the author in a \\"afterword\\" tries to justify the historical facts. This is a work of fiction however; I wouldn't want to write a doctorate thesis based on this book. But I must say that it certainly brought me back in time to the English Court and made me aware of all its intrigues, romance and cruelty.I loved this book, and gobbled it up in almost one fell sweep. And right after finishing it, I purchased two more books from this author and am currently enraptured by the second one.Highly recommended, especially for a long airplane trip."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, combining romance and British history...I wanted to read it before I saw the film, and I'm so glad I did, because although the film was beautiful and well-acted, thebook had so much more detail and made all the relationships understandable. I have read a lot of British history, and knew virtually nothing about Mary Boleyn. Phillipa Gregory did some amazing research, and then used her knowledge to create this wonderful historical fiction.Of course the characters were real people, but the conversations and situations that she creates bring them to life. I couldn't put it down.When it was finished, I wanted it to go on. Just a fabulous read!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book several months ago, but just couldn't find the time to read it. I planned on reading it before the movie, of course that didn't happen and I was tried of friends talking about how much they enjoyed the book. So, I picked it up during my spring break and couldn't put it down! I'm not really familiar with Tudor history so I didn't have any background information to compare it to. A couple of other reviews have called the book trashy and not accurate in it's historical information-I didn't expect it to be a accurate, it's a fictional account of King Henry VII, Mary and Anne Boleyn relationships. I loved the trashy elements of the book and can't wait to read the sequel. I've never been a fan of historical romances, but I look forward to reading some of her other books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a terrific book! It grips you in the first chapter and doesn't let go! I am not a person who is all that much into reading period pieces but this was just an intriguing story that was well written.I really enjoyed this book alot. Warning: this book will consume you! I found myself up reading until 2 am on many nights without even realizing it..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While I mostly enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's novel, The Other Boleyn Girl, I found myself constantly turning to the internet to \\"fact check\\", only to be disappointed that the novel was, more often than not, incorrect. When I began reading I had been under the impression that this was a groundbreaking, mildly fictionalized account of the life of the lesser known Boleyn sister. Thus, I was left baffled, much like I had been upon reading The da Vinci Code. Had I no preconceived notions of accuracy before I began reading, I would have enjoyed the novel much more because I could have read it purely as fiction. If you know little about history and do not care to know more, you will enjoy this book for its purely speculative nature. That P.G. firmly believes she is telling the truth will be of no consequence to you. However, if like me, you actually do know about history and do care, then you will find this book to be sordid and silly. As the saying goes, \\"take it with a grain of salt\\" and you will more than likely be entertained. Just don't read it expecting some revelation of history. You won't find it here."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Love to read. Did not know this was now a movie until after I read the book. If you like this era this is a book you will not be able to put down. It is an easy read and absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am such a huge fan of Phillippa Gregory -- and this book started it all. This historical fiction is exceptionally well-researched, and keeps you caught up in the sexy drama of the relationships between Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn & her sister Mary Boleyn, while offering some insight to the powerful family leaders trying to influence the king. Offers a beautiful feel for the period. Even though you know what's going to happen to Anne, it's a joy to read, and I hated for this book to end!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This abridgement completely butchers the book. I have never before experienced an abridgement that left out so much important information and that was this choppy. Although the reader is quite good, I can't recommend this form of this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"this book was a real page turner. not only for the compelling storyline but also for the historical documentation. it was like THE DAVINCI CODE for me..i couldn't wait to see how it ended but i dreaded reading the last words. this was my first gregory novel and have since ordered 3 others."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The well known story of the scandalous romance of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn is told this time through the eyes of Mary Boleyn, Anne's younger sister who was the first Boleyn girl to catch the king's eye and become his mistress. Mary, like all the Boleyn girls, was a commodity for the family to trade for things of value - titles, estates, connections. Their only worth was as wives or mistresses to the wealthy and powerful, only as valuable as the children they could produce.Mary had been forced into a marriage as a young teenager before she was old enough to fully understand all that was expected of her, and while she felt affection for her husband the only pleasure she got from her marriage was that it was something her sister Anne did not have. The two were only a year apart and had spent their entire lives in intense rivalry with each other. When Anne returned from the French court to join Mary as a lady in waiting to Queen Katherine the two quickly resumed their old relationship of defending each other against the world while competing with each other.When Mary becomes the King's latest conquest her chief allies are Anne and their brother George. They help her with the practical aspects of attracting and maintaining the King's attentions to further the directives of their father and uncle. Inevitably Henry's attentions turned elsewhere, this time to Anne beginning their long and scandalous courtship that lead to the overthrow of Rome and Queen Katherine - an act that meant that no English wife would be safe any longer. As Anne and Henry's story continued to it's well known conclusion Mary struggled to carve a place for herself and her children in the dangerous climate of the Tudor court.Gregory has based her story on the facts that are known about the times, filling in the gaps with her conjectures. Therefore Mary and the rest of the characters all existed and their actions are consistent with the accounts available from the times. By her skillful blending of the known facts and her speculations, Gregory has woven an exciting tale of life in the Tudor court as in the years that Henry began to change from charming young prince to cruel spoiled tyrant. The precarious life of the women is particularly emphasized, that while all women were at the mercy of the men in their lives perhaps the wealthy, privileged women were the most vulernable of all.This is an excellent, enthralling read. Gregory gives the reader both an exciting, sensational story of a love and tragedy in these interesting times. It would be a good introduction to the period for anyone unfamiliar with the story as well as a fresh interpretation for those who are. There are also sources cited in the back for anyone who wants to learn more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain; the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family. I have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything I could have learnt in history class.I recommend this book without really saying why (for fear of ruining parts) but coming from a history know nothing I say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was completely unaware of Anne Boleyn's siblings but they truly come to life in this novel. The intrigue, greed and cut-throat ambition of Henry VIII's courtiers knows no bounds. Philippa Gregory's novel is compelling, entertaining, educational and a must read for anyone interested in this period of British history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The air of competition and ambition that made up Mary Boleyn's life is not often the story that you hear when speaking of the Boleyns and life at the English court. Philippa Gregory weaves an almost fantastical tale of ambition, pride, and greed and two girls who were sacrificed at the alter of their family's desire for power. The relationship between Anne Boleyn, her sister Mary (the Other Boleyn Girl), and their brother George is at the forefront of this nearly 700-page novel. We follow the family for 15 years on their quest for the throne. Along the way there is marriage, murder, death, disgrace, and everything else you could imagine in a country guided by the whims of its aristocracy.The Other Boleyn girl is the first piece of historical fiction of its kind that I've read and I was impressed with it, if a little surprised. Gregory takes some liberties with the past, though in her author's note she substantiates them and cites references, which is helpful. In its efforts to depict the day-to-day life of a court more than 400 years old, Gregory has given us a story of a family so blinded by ambition that it tore itself apart. I found The Other Boleyn Girl an engaging true tale of the pitfalls of greed and when I'm in the mood for another 600-page novel, I'll definitely pick up another of Gregory's books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am amazed that there are people out there that did not like this book, because I could NOT put it down!It was one of the best reads I have had in a while. It was fascinating to get a look inside the English court of the times. No, it is not a textbook of history, but the author has done her research of the times and it shows.Reading it, I alternated between fury, sadness, delight, and all things in bewtween - which is what a truly good book should do to your senses!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I work in a book store, and whenever I walked by this book, I thought the cover was gorgeous, and so one day I signed it out and I absolutely loved it. I read it in about 3 days (totally neglecting schoolwork) and I was caught up in all of the family drama. I've read other of Philippa's books as well (The Constant Princess, Queen's Fool, Virgin Lover) and she is a wonderful writer. I love how these books tell almost the same story, just with different people. I absolutely recommend this book, it's amazing!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Another great book by Philppa Gregory. An Intense story about king, court and passionate rivals set in the time of Henery VIII. This is one book you wont want to put down...even if you think know the end of the story"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is an intriguing historical fiction novel based on the infamous Anne Boleyn and her often overlooked sister Mary, overshadowed by her sister's brazenness and tumultuous relationship with King Henry of England. However, the story focuses on how Mary, too, rose to be one of the most powerful women in England as mistress to the indulgent King Henry. It also shows the way in which women were used solely as pawns in the royal game of chess and how as soon as one started to lose her luster and the king's eyes began to roam, she was quickly withdrawn, virtually forgotten, and replaced in the blink of an eye by a woman often younger and even more beautiful. Mostly, though, it passionately illustrates the seduction, corruption, and intoxication of power that existed in the royal court. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"In this book Gregory tells the tale of the Boleyn family and there ambition to become prominet in the court of Henry VIII of England in the 1500's. The tale begins with the youngest of the Boleyn girl's Mary. When her family discovers that the king, who is frustrated with his current wife Katherine because she is unable to give him a son, is taken with Mary they push her to pursue the relationship eventhough she is barely 14 years old and already married. The Boleyn's hope to gain power and money through this relationship and hope that Mary can succeed where the queen failed by giving Henry a son. Mary has two children with the king, a girl Catherine and a boy Henry.After Henry is born Mary's family encourages her to try to get the king to divorce his wife who has gone through menapouse and can no longer have children and marry her. This way her family will be the family of the next king of England. However, all Mary wants to do is be with her children who have been sent to her family home and while she is away Anne takes her place and catches the eye of the king. She claims she does this because she does not want to see the king turn his eye to anyone else in the court but when Mary returns from her family home the king has cast her aside for Anne.The rest of the book centers around Anne's rise and fall from power as seen through Mary's eyes. Anne will stop at nothing in her quest to become queen be it murder or manipulating the king to get the church to grant him a divorce. Once she is queen she continues her power games stoping at nothing to try to have a son with the king. When she is unable to do this the King casts her aside much in the same manner he did the queen for someone younger. During this time Mary's reunites with her first husband who ultimatley dies and she marries another man for love against the wishes of her family.Overall this story is well told. I could not wait to find out what happened next and thus found it a quick read. Gregory does a good job with her charcters making them interesting and lively. She succeeds in giving a new perspective to a famous period in history and creats an engaging read in doing it. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The other Boleyn girl is a wonderful book because of the glimpse it gives you of history you never thought about. when you look at the known history afterwards, it is indeed an interesting question: why didn't henry marry the girl who had already proven fertile? Mary had already given him a son, because writings of the time tell us of little Henry Carey who bore such a strong resemblance to King Henry when he grew up.It's an interesting book with many layers in it, there are so many beautifully described feelings and emotions in all the characters, you can read it again and again and always find something new in it. the rivalry of the two sisters is portrayed in an exciting way, all the time you know they must love each other and it's interesting to see how ambition can drive people so far apart from each other and from themselves.in the end, it's just a lovely story, really a book to read in one go."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"There is nothing quite like a true inside look into the chambers of British Monarchy.I found myself getting swept in the dark, dank castles where Phillipa Gregory sat,watched and wrote her novel while Anne Boleyn made her manipulative moves to ensnare the infamous King Henry VIII.I became so totally engrossed in this authentically written piece of literature that I often lost track of the fact that I really lived in 21st Century America.Phillipa Gregory is a master of her craft, may she continue to write so beautifully.-Yvonne Bornstein, Author, Eleven Days of Hell."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Author Philippa Gregory always awes me.Her prose is exquisite, and her scholarship is of the highest order.These two aspects of her writing couple to enable her to create historical fiction of the strictest standards of accuracy.THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is an account of the courtship of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn--though, actually, Anne courted Henry--of Anne's reign as his queen, and of Anne's eventual denouement, all purportedly reported by Anne's only sister. In fact, it is ambiguous whether the \\"other\\" girl of the title refers to the sister or to Anne herself.Writing in the first person, Gregory's knowledge is so detailed that the reader truly can believe that this book is a contemporaneous account. It seems as if THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL easily could have been written during the 16th century, though the language actually is modern.Philippa Gregory is one of the finest authors of historic fiction ever to have been published, and one never can go wrong reading one of her books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Suffice it to say this was a great book, a captivating read. Fantastic piece of historical fiction. Even if you know how it ends, I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Philippa Gregory retells the story of Anne Boleyn as seen through the eyes of her younger sister, Mary. The Boleyn Girls, along with their brother George, have been attending the king of England's court since they were children. At the age of fourteen, Mary captures the attention of King Henry VIII. Despite the fact that both of them are already married, Mary and Henry become lovers at the insistance of the Boleyn family, which uses Mary as a pawn in its desire for advancement within the royal circle. Mary struggles with her desires for the king, her loyalty to her husband, and her rivalry with her sister, Anne, who eventually surpasses Mary in the king's eyes and sets her sights on becoming the next queen of England.There isn't a dull moment in this book...even though it's almost 700 pages long, I finished it in just a few days because I found it impossible to put down! Anyone who enjoys British history will get a kick out of this wonderful retelling of one of the most scandalous events in England's history. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" offers rich characterizations and an exciting plot that will keep readers entertained until the very end, even though anyone who's ever picked up a history book already knows what the outcome of this tragic story will be.I highly recommend this book to everyone...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This in my opinion is a great book. Philippa Gregory is definitely a writer who will trap you in the story. She incorporates historical facts with the interpretation of that time..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was the first historical fiction novel I've ever read and now I'm addicted! I was amazed at how the story felt completely fictional and yet in reality was so accurate to the true story of Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary! Who knew learning could be so fun! I have also felt sympathy for Anne, even though she could be very ambitious. I felt that Philippa Gregory did an excelent job of humanizing her and creating a realistic character that had a little angel and devil in her. Even if you think history is boring I would recommend this book to you ! I have read four of Philippa Gregory's books so far and love every single one of them with a passion, she is truely a gifted writer!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory, the author of fourteen books, soars high above her standard with the compelling novel, The Other Boleyn Girl. In a combination of historic information, lively story and rivalry between the two beautiful Boleyn sisters, Gregorycreates a rich tale of ambition, love, competition and deception. The story begins with sweet Mary Boleyn, the younger sister, in a constant struggle to win King Henry the VIII's affections and to be in the spotlight of the court. Through her family's ambitious plotting and scheming, she eventually succeeds and makes it her duty to spend every waking hour pleasing him.As Gregory stresses, men often tend to lose interest in what comes easily to them, and soon, King Henry's attention shifts to Mary's evil sister, Anne. Anne's backstabbing and self-centered confidence leads to the fall of good Queen Katherine and the beginning of the new Anne, the Queen of England. Barely surviving through struggle and heartbreak, Mary realizes that she must take her fate into her own hands and discovers that wealth and power does not lead to happiness.\\"Anne, I (Mary) warn you...I will not take this. I married a good man for love, I did no more than the Princess Mary Tudor did when she married the Duke of Suffolk. I married once to oblige my family, I did as they bid me when the king looked my way, and now I want to please myself\\" (Gregory 661). Mary lived most of her life trying to live up to people's expectations, but soon found her priorities were in the ones she loved, not the impressions others had of her.I highly recommend this novel, it targets teenage girls and older. The story line, although taking place a long time ago, deals with the same issues in which teenagers deal with today. Topics of relationships, love, sex, and dishonesty outline the plot. \\"Together they (Anne and a man of the court) are accused of being lovers and making the baby which was born a monster...you have been party to many late nights in Anne's room. You taught her to seduce the king, after you had been his lover for years\\" (Gregory 647).This book is extremely difficult to put down. The story evokes the rivalry of the two sisters and the quest for power in the exciting and glamorous court of Europe. The Other Boleyn introduces two women of extraordinary determination and desire."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The other boeyln girl is one of the best books I have ever read.

Not much is known about Mary Boleyn, but Phillipa Gregory does an amazing job with three facts: 1) Mary was the mistress of a King 2) her sister was Anne Boleyn 3) she defied her family and court to marry for love.I was delighted to discover that Mary's daughter Catherine was the mother of Lettice Knollys, who ended up marrying Queen Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Dudley (I adore all those wonderful Jean Plaidy/Victoria Holt novels like &quot;My Enemy, the Queen.&quot;)"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What did I think of the book The Other Boleyn Girl?

It was refreshing to read about these familiar characters from another perspective. I will read more of Philippa Gregory's books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Before I get started, I'd like to first and foremost admit that my knowledge in history is severely lacking. I was not a good student in school, and of all the subjects I floated through, history was certainly one of the subjects that took the hardest hit. Plus, they didn't have the History Channel when I was in school, which would have been WAY better than the lackluster instructors that turned me off to the past. That said, the only thing I really know about King Henry the Eighth is that he existed at some point in time and there is a children's song about him (and I do not even know the lyrics to said song).Given that I have no previous knowledge or opinion of King Henry the Eighth, his first wife Queen Katherine, or any of the Boleyns for that matter, I went along with the story just fine, finding things quite believable (even though, as a work of historical fiction, we all know that they are not truth). I was not shocked, upset, or disappointed with Gregory's treatment of the characters like some readers have expressed, simply because I was a blank slate that knew next to nothing about these historical figures or their lives to begin with. So, while I found the work to be pretty entertaining, I accept that it is in all probability, to some extent, a deviation from historical fact.The book sucked me and kept my attention quite well for most of it's duration (600+ pages) however it did lag a bit about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through. It just hit a couple of points when all I could think was \\"Is Anne ever going to marry the King already?\\" and \\"Is Anne ever going to get pregnant and carry a baby to term again?\\" Of course, given the nature of the book, the drama carried me through. And although many people have said the depiction of Mary's character was historically inaccurate (as well as the King's and Anne's for that matter), it didn't mean I couldn't relate to her wanting to get the hell out of that court and live a more pure and simple life with the man she loved in the country. I'd churn butter any day over having to deal with the stuff that went down in the court.So, overall, a pretty entertaining read and a page turner."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Ms Gregory did it again.

I had no idea that it was a true story and it was only out of curiosity that I decided to google Boleyn and discover the world of the Tudors. I was by that time absolutely fascinated with the story and intrigued by the history. Some viewers commented about some inaccuracies with history and there are some ongoing arguments about who is the older sister and whethe Anne really did some of the acts she was accused of. Irregardless , for me, a great story (storyteller) is one of the best ways to get someone interested in history (otherwise factual, objective and hard to \\"just read\\". Love this story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon..and I loved it! My mother , who has passed away now, loved these stories about Henry the Eighth and the Queens..and I sure enjoyed this one! Lots of different characters in it and I am a slow reader...but when a book is good, I like to savor it and make it last..I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really enjoyed this book. From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat and found it really hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Because of this book, i read 4 others written by Gregory. I was hooked on the book from page 1 and couldn't put it down. Absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have read many books on the Tudors, some more fiction based and some more fact based. I have read books from writers like Alison Weir, Jean Plaidy and even though I have enjoyed their books immensely, I have to say that Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite writers in the historical fiction genre!! When I read this book \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", I knew next to nothing about Mary Boleyn and this book opened my eyes to her world and made me want to find out more about her and what she was really like. Now I have read other books about her from writers like Alison Weir and Karen Harper, but I keep going back to this book because even though it's not totally historically accurate, it is such a good story in and of itself that it is worth reading! Philippa Gregory is such a good storyteller that she makes these people and places come alive so you believe in their lives and struggles!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"We have all read and been taught the story of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII. What we know little of is Anne's sister, Mary. Mary was the favorite and youngest lady-in-waiting for Queen Katherine. She was also married at age 13 to William Carey, a good friend and man high in favor with the king. When Mary catches the eye of the King, Mary's family, The Boleyn's and the Howard's, decide she must leave her husband to be available to the King. Soon, Mary finds herself in love with the King. She gives him two children. When the King begins to lose interest in Mary, the family decides she must step aside in order to let her sister Anne, seduce the King. Anne indeed catches the King's eye. For three years, she keeps the King's interest without giving into him sexually, although she does satisfy him in other ways.The King wants her so bad he will do anything to have her. She convinces him to leave Queen Katherine and to obtain an annulment. She also introduces him to Martin Luther's religion teachings. This change in the church practices begins the new Church of England. Anne becomes quite ruthless in her need of power, not only over the King, the Court, but also her family,Mary had spent time at her family's estate in Hever. After her children were born, the children remained there to be cared for and Mary returned to Court to perform her duties. She was allowed to return to Hever during the summer months. On one of her trips, she was escorted by William Stafford. He stayed at Hever with her and they fell in love. Eventually, they married without permission. He later built her a home in the area, and they moved there to raise their children.There is so much more detail and story lines in this book; Queen Katherine, the King's spoiled, selfish rants and needs, the relationship between England, France, Spain, and the Catholic Church, the sibling relationship between Anne, Mary, and George, and the dynamics of the Boleyn-Howard family.We must remember this is historical fiction of the Tudor Court. There are inaccuracies but it gives us a very vivid look into the time period and life of King Henry's court. It was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"They sent the book exceptionally fast for coming over from the UK. Brand new never opened just like the discription said. Very pleased."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I cannot understand the negatives of this book. It's not meant to be an accurate story of Anne Boleyn, but a historical fiction story of Mary. I am a huge Anne fan, and I loved this book. It's what got me started on reading TRUE biographies of her life and as much of Mary as I can find also.This is a wonderfully written, and very crafted story of the entire Boleyn Family. I enjoyed it so much, I've probably read it 5 times now.Philippa can do no wrong in my reviews! She's a true story-teller!! You'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I kept hearing about this book but hadn't found the time to read it. When I found it on CD, I made the purchase and immediately began listening. It was unlike any book I had \\"read\\" before and I became a Philippa Gregory fan. The detail of the period pulled me right in and I also found myself shocked at the extremes others would go to so they could have what they want. I will now be looking for other books by Gregory"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was very happy with the purchase. I love any story of King Henry VIII of England, and find the book very interesting. I decided to buy a used one since I prefer to save environment and this book is pretty fat. The quality of the second hand book satisfied me."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I don't think I liked this book as much as the others that Gregory has written. It was from the point of view of Mary Boleyn. She was shown as a whinny and almost immature woman, being over shadowed by her evil sister, Anne. We all know that Anne Boleyn was an incredibly awful woman. She was power hungry and had almost no soul, so there was nothing for Mary to be except for the obedient sister. I don't care if there are people that disagree with me, all I know is that the book wasn't very historically accurate on Mary's part, but was spot on on Anne's. I love Philippa Gregory and will continue to read her books on the dangerous life in the court of Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found this book to be a very fantastic read and really enjoyed the story, the characters, and the excitement of it all. This book added to the story line and helps peak the interest of the reader. All of Philippa Gregory books are well written. I find it very interesting to learn about the history of England's king and queens. I have read all of her books in the series except The Other Queen which I did find to be written poorly which is a disappointment that I had to pay for something written this bad. But Other then that book all the others are worth the price. A Must Read"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I guess I should first put out a disclaimer that I know barely anything about English history. Therefore I don't look at this book from a historical perspective, but rather just read it as I would any fiction book. Out of all the ones I've read from Gregory, I do have to say that this is probably my favorite.Mary Boleyn is the younger daughter of a great house. Already married, that doesn't stop her when her family decides to use her to seduce King Henry VIII as he has shown interest in her. She bears him two children and while she is doing so, her older sister Anne then catches his attention. Anne has bigger plans though, plans that include the crown if she can manage to convince Henry to quietly remove the current Queen who has produced no heir for him. Mary has to help her sister despite being heartbroken herself, and the game becomes dangerous with intrigue as each step must be played right or they will face the hangman.I liked Mary as a character. She may have been too sweet and good at times, but as the narrator there is a certain charm about her. She just seems down to earth when compared with the rest of the characters and she wants the same things I do from my life. Anne was a snippy thing and I think Gregory made it hard for any reader to like her as she was full of ambition without a care for hurting anyone. King Henry was as selfish a King as he was in Gregory's other book, The Constant Princess. He is also another hard to like figure in history. Mary and Anne's brother George was an interesting character. He had a bright personality despite all his troubles in the court.Since this is based on history I thought that it flowed pretty well. There was enough of a draw that I had to keep reading and didn't want to put it down. It did move slowly in some parts but luckily that never lasted to long. I would have much preferred to hear more about Mary's life but she is slowly taken over by Anne in the book, even though she is the narrator. For those faint of heart there are some somewhat graphic scenes about childbirth, miscarriages, and sex in this book. They aren't horrendous descriptions but still enough that if you picture it in your head you might be queasy.An interesting tale. I found it engaging and will definitely read more by Gregory.The Other Boleyn GirlCopyright 2001661 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love to read about the Tudor era and this was full of information I had never heard before. The fact that Mary had two of King Henry's children fails to make it into most biography's or movies. I have a sister and can't imagine having to compete against her for the kings affection. Incredible novel and great fast read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was never interested in historical novels and knew very little about this time period, but I found this book incredibly interesting. I could not put it down and didn't want the story to end. I would recomend this book to anyone, even if they are not interested in historical novels. I enjoyed the perfect blend of historical accuracy and the imagined emotions of the characters. It is a glimpse into what time was like during this very interesting time period. The story and characters will stay with the readers for a long time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I've read much Allison Weir and Margaret George, and while they are great, this book reads much more like a novel. There is a Q&amp;A with the author in the back which explains how much is historically accurate (and from what sources) and how much is fiction. There are also discussion questions to use if you are reading the book for a report or book club. This book primarily focuses on Mary Boleyn. I don't think there is quite as much available material on Mary as on Ann and it was great to have one possibility of her viewpoint of this terrible and exciting time in England's history.I would definitely recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction as well as newcomers to the genre. If you haven't learned to love historical fiction yet, you will with this book. I am just waiting for more from Gregory to satisfy my appetite."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read a lot and was looking for something a little different when I picked this up at the bookstore. I do not usually read historical fiction. But I thought I should try something different and I am so glad I did. This book is well written and the characters are developed very well. I began to identify with the Characters and became very involved in the story. It is true that historically it may not be the most acurate but to those who are so critical of that let me remind you this is FICTION. YOu may want to try something nonficiton or biographical if you are looking for straight history.This book is a big book and may seem intimidating but it is not, I found it to be an easy read and I found myself up late at night trying to finish it. When I did finish it I was sorry it was over but so glad I had read it. I am now a huge Philippa Gregory fan and have already started another Of her books &quot;Wildacre&quot;."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a wonderful book revealing the way of life in England in the Middle Ages. The little known Mary Boleyn telling the story of her family and her sister Anne as queen of England gives insite previously unknown. This is actually as romance novel, but it gives a real feel for the subordination of women during the time of Henry VIII. It made me want to learn more about Henry's other wives. A great quick read even though it's over 600 pages. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read an obscene amount of books and rarely do I find one that leaves me wanting more. Since I read this book I have had trouble getting into other books because they seem so much less. From the first page I was hooked and drawn into the story. The characters were stongly developed and I found myself sharing their emotions and thoughts. I could not put the book down, I finished it in two days and was sad to come to the end. I cheered for Mary, wished ill to Anne and sympathized with Mary's first husband who was cast aside. It was a side to Tudor history that I have never faced for little is mentioned about Mary in other books, except to make her seem like a trashy plaything for the King. I passed this book on to a non-reader and she was unable to put it down also."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. From the very beginning, the reader is swept up into another time and place. I've read historical fiction before, and one thing I've always appreciated is when an author relates even small details of what life was like in the period they are writing about. Ms. Gregory does just that with this book. A reader can almost visulize what court life was like during the reign of Henry VIII - as well as smell the food at the feasts and feel the cloth used to make gowns.This book is longer than most at 600+ pages, but I still finished it in a week. It moves along very quickly for the most part. There are a couple of times in the book that scenes seem repeated, but it truly comes together at a later time. Also, there are a few historical inaccuracies, granted. But that is to be expected in historical fiction - operative word here being fiction. If this book were to be a biography, it would fall far short. But it is a work of fiction, and as such, the author does a fine job.I would give this book 5 stars, however, I felt the ending was a bit weak and contrived. But then again, anyone who knows about Anne Boleyn knows how it is to end, right? Yet, I felt Ms. Gregory could have worked in something a little more entertaining. However, this book is nicely written, moves along at a good pace, and draws the reader into its presence. With all of that, it is certainly worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A friends daughter gave this book to me knowing how much I love to read. I knew nothing about the book when I got it. It is going to be high up on my all time favorite list. It's a thick book, but it's so good when I'm not reading it I'm thinking about reading it!Even though it's fiction, there are so many historical facts that I wasn't aware of, it's very educational and has made me want to read more accounts of Anne Boleyn and the other wives of Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thoroughly enjoy reading historical fiction; I find it both entertaining and educational. That said, this was one of the better books available in the genre. The Other Boleyn Girl revealed a side of the pawn-like roles assigned women in the past I'd never considered. Imagine, sleeping with a man (ok, so he WAS the king of England)at the express instruction of your family; being forced into adultery, dis-avowing an existing marriage merely to enhance the family's standing in the king's eyes. Such greedy, self-serving behavior at the expense of a young woman's virtue is considered shocking in the modern world. Imagine the outrage if it were discovered Monica Lewinsky's parents had instructed her to do what she did, for the sole purpose of financial gain for their family.Philippa Gregory sheds light on the rigors of court life as no other author has ever done. I felt weary myself simply reading about the time and effort both Mary and Ann Boleyn put into pleasing the king. The plotting and scheming done by the Howard family was diabolically amazing. Uncle Howard's lack of feeling for anyone but himself and the advancement of the family name gave me chills.The romance between Mary and William Stafford was the only warm and fuzzy aspect in a novel filled with the darker facets of human nature. Gregory's decision to refer to the rumored incestual relationship between Anne and brother George further added to the image of the overall depravity of the Howard family. Anne's willingnes to sleep with her brother in an effort to produce an heir illustrated her desperation not to be put aside by Henry, and foreshadowed the evidence given for her ultimate demise.This book has it all: greed, murder, sex, incest, homo-sexuality, love, treachery, war, religous and social upheaval.I recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a surprise to me. It gave such a great insight in to the Boleyn Family; a refreshing look at Anne, and especially Mary, the main caracter. Wow!! Great pageturner, changed my perspective entirely on the perspective of women of Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Oh my, oh my, oh my! I could not get enough of this book. So riveting, so much diabolical, self serving behavior! You can't make up a story like this. And the writing is wonderful. You read and read and realize you have covered 100 pages in a blink. Very fluid writing. A wonderful story. A must read and reread a few years later."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory's story reads quickly, it is really enthralling and entertaining, but it is not that well-written. Not to mention, at times it is like a \\"bodice-ripper\\" Harlequin novel -- the sex scenes were surprising and prevalent. In my opinion, it is a light \\"beach read\\" and not a serious work of literature, but enjoyable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The title of The Other Boleyn Girl pretty much says it all; it's the story of Anne Boleyn's sister Mary, who was Henry VIII's mistress before he became infatuated with Anne. The historical Mary seems to have been very different from the rest of her ambitious family, receiving virtually nothing of value from Henry herself and eventually marrying, after her first husband's death, a comparatively humble man and becoming the only one of the three Boleyn children to die in bed. In this novel, however, although she is the pawn of her family, pushed into the path of the king in her mid-teens, she is far more.In Gregory's portrayal, Mary is an extremely sympathetic character but also a flawed one. She admires Queen Katherine but betrays her not only with Henry, a situation in which she has little choice, but also in more reprehensible ways. She allows her first marriage to become all but meaningless, but eventually, after Henry leaves her for Anne, begins to feel a growing closeness to her husband and, after his death, finds the strength to defy her sister and father to marry a man she loves. Despite her sometimes bitter rivalry with Anne, Mary and her daughter are the only members of the family who defend her upon her arrest. By the end of the book, Mary has truly become her own woman and can leave the court, as well as the world stage, for a real, fulfilling life.The politics of Henry's court are also portrayed in all their sordid detail: family gatherings centering on which sister should be pushed into the king's bed and how to keep her there; the bribery of maids to find out whether the queen has had her period and the secret disposal of miscarried babies; the pimping of his own sisters by their brother George, who has his own shameful secret; the intrigues of councilors and churchmen to achieve the king's desires and their own ambitions. Yet for the most part, these people are portrayed as living human beings, not angels or monsters.My main quibble with this book, and the reason it doesn't rate five stars with me, is its portrayal of Anne Boleyn. Gregory gives a realistic picture of her charm, drive, and relentless ambition to become queen, but other aspects of her character are not delineated as well. When she falls in love with Henry Percy (son of the Earl of Northumberland, not the Duke), I find it hard to believe, although Gregory obviously means for it to be a real passion that affects the course of Anne's life. Also, even though Mary mentions her (Anne) reading theology with the king as well as her wit, I never get a sense of her real intelligence or of a personality behind the obsessive ambition.On the whole, however, I recommend this book very highly; despite its almost 700 pages it only took me a few days to get through it and I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Don't be deterred by its length, The Other Boleyn Girl is a worthwhile read. With this novel, the reader gets history, mixed with drama and adventure. As a reader, you grow to have true feelings for these characters, while you might know what historically happened to them.A fine novel!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was captivated by this book. Philipa Gregory created an amazing picture of Anne Boleyn. I was shocked and surprised by so many of the events in the story. I loved it and can't wait to read another."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had given up on finding any more books that suited my liking. After reading this novel I became obsessed with obtaining the rest of the Philippa Gregory works. I'm currently reading The Queen's Fool and The Virgin's Lover at the same time. They are fabulous books and brought me back to reading. The politics are exciting as well as the love stories that made history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book as a sort of break from the 'heavier' reading I usually gravitate toward, and I found it immensely enjoyable. There is nothing particularly poetic or soul-stirring about the writing itself, but the storyline is fast-paced and intriguing; it took me less than 24 hours to get through these 600 pages.From a woman's perspective, it is truly startling to see the role that women were forced to play at this point in history; even the so-called 'fortunate' women of society were nothing more than pawns for power, or the playthings of men. Anne Boleyn is absolutely tyrannical in her own ambition, lacking any sense of inner morality, which makes her repulsive. Yet she and Mary each have the strength, in their own ways, to take charge of their own destinies.The book's conclusion definitely left me with a haunted feeling. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting, quick read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an easy read....great for summer beaches or tired minds. It is a bit trashy. I expected more history outside the bedroom."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a real page turner. Historically accurate. And entertaining at the same time. I have become a fan of P. Gregory's as a result. Can't wait to read &quot;The Virgin's Lover&quot;.It opens up the world of the English court of Henry VIII, and lets us experience the day to day dealings of being a courtier. The love story between Mary and William was delightful."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I never knew anything about Mary Boleyn and I have always been interested in the wives of Henry VIII. I would reccomend any other books by this author, especially \\"The Queen's Fool\\"."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Until this book, I have not really gotten into historical fiction, but once I started reading, I was captivated. The way the story is woven, the characters pop to life. Very well done, I look forward to reading many more of Philippa Gregory's books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am actually a bit torn between a 3 star and 4 star rating on this one. I enjoyed the book and thought it was at least an interesting picture of sibling rivalry. I loved that it took a different sort of look at this time in Henry VIII's court. But I felt that the characters were a bit vapid--especially Mary, who seemed to change her mind depending on which way the wind was blowing. Still, the novel as a whole was fairly historically accurate and did keep me interested, even though of course I knew how it would end--at least for Anne."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is captivating and provocative. You will not be able to put it down. I am a newly converted fan of historical fiction because of this book and am on the hunt for others like it. The movie will be released in February, 2008 and I hope it does justice to this magnificent story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It was as if I could project myself into this time period and see, feel, smell and touch everything. I will read it again."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was an excellent book. The characters were believable and I almost forget that it was a work of fiction. It brought out so many emotions in me. I laughed, cried and even hurled the book at some points. I highly recommend this book as a must read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this down. Although it's listed as fiction, the way the author wrote this story in such beautiful and readable historical context I was motivated to read more by her and other fiction and non-fiction reads on the Reformation."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book as an airplane read, but found myself enthralled with the characters so much I couldn't put it down until I read every last word. Despite knowing how it would end, I read every page in suspense and hope for the Boleyn family. The story is still lingering in my mind while I wait for the next historical fiction novel to be delivered.The Other Boleyn Girl is narrated by Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary Boleyn, the most notorious adulteress of the time. When Queen Katherine becomes barren after not producing a male heir for Henry VIII, political families jockey for the king's favor, and the queen's crown, by manipulating the young neices and daughters of the family. As soon as she hits puberty, Mary is trapped into a life of serving the Howard and Boleyn families' ambitions for wealth and power. Intent on getting a legitimate heir for his throne and fulfilling his every desire, Henry VIII uses his supreme power to manipulate even the laws the church to get exactly what he wants. Mary, Anne, and their brother, George Boleyn are in the middle of the mayhem. Gregory's book draws you into the seasonal consequences and rewards, merriment and distress, of being a member of Henry VIII's court and what it takes to stay there."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I simply couldn't put it down for 1 minute. Once I got caught in the life and times of a courtier, I was intrigued. The mixture of court life and the \\"real life\\" insight into the ambition and schemes of the families left me wanting more with each page turn. I've never experienced old England like this before. Great novel....I couldn't wait to share it with my friends."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"English history has always been a favorite of mine, especially the era surrounding QE-1. This book was an extremely interesting read, in additon to entertaining, in that it provided a completely different opinion of the Boleyn girls. This story provides a look into the sacrifices each sister made in order to have favor with the king, with Anne being \\"the bad\\" and Mary being \\"the good.\\" I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a different perspective on the lives surrounding the young Boleyn women."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I Loved this I will read it again. I never wanted to read anything twice.I of course continue to tout her books. Never have I purchased a series before and I hope Phillipa selects other historical periods to write about."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Even if you are roughly aware of the history and know the outcome, this book is great."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I could not put this book down! Even if it didn't stay true to the facts, it was still an engaging read that I recommend to everyone I come across. I have never read historical fiction before, but this was a delightful introduction to the genre."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Interesting reading. Helps to understand English history in the time period. Sad to learn how badly women were treated. Would have liked a bit more follow up to ending."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Just a quick review.. No Spoilers.. Awesome book even though it may not be exactly true in history, it was a great read.

An entertaining, have-to-keep-reading story! I will definitely read this book again (and again when I am in the mood for a good read!)"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have never read historical fiction, but when I saw this coming out as a movie I decided to read the book first. It was a really good book and made me want more. I am now reading more Philippa Gregory novels."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Once I started this book I couldnt put it down. It is a good book and I will definitely read more Phillipa Gregory books in the future !! I highly recommend it !!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book in accord with the release of the movie, and I loved every minute of it. It's a great mixture between history and fiction that will not be disappointing. Philippa Gregory truly captured Henry VIII time in history and it was fantastic for those of us that love to research for what is fact and what is fiction. No regrets here!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I usually avoid any novel that isn't properly considered literature, however every once in awhile I crave an escape that lingers without requiring much additional thought or 'unpacking' and The Other Boleyn Girl certainly hit the spot. The writing is simple and straight forward - nothing special - but the story is great (you can't make [most of] that stuff up!) and Gregory makes the characters truly compelling. I love how she shows the change in Henry VIII as he gets older and after his crippling leg injury. The Tudor period has always been fascinating to me, but her book actually renewed my interest and I have ordered books off of the bibliography Gregory included. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a satisfying page-turner."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book has all the elements of a good juicy story. Unfortuantely it is based in part on history. The characters are well defined and deliciously evil people who are motivated only by increasing their own power and position. Although it is 600+ pages, I think i read it in 10 days which for me is a small miracle. I am now reading hte Boelyn Inheritance and it is also really good. Great author."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Totally exciting read from beginning to end"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am a writer and an avid reader, and this is simply one of the best books I've ever read. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end without a lapse. It created such a vivid picture of the people and their time that I feel as if I was there, that I knew them. The writing is faultless. The only problem with it is that it is over! I've finished it, and I can only wonder when again I'll have a reading experience as complete."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book single handedly launched me into an investigative research on Tudor history and specifically Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary. I had picked up the book based on the knowledge that Philippa Gregory wrote fairly historicaly accurate books. After the first chapter or two, I was absolutely hooked.The story is told through Mary's, Anne's sister's, perspective. If you are at all aware of the history of Anne Boleyn, then you already know the gist of what happens, however, that doesn't spoil the book by any means. The beauty of the book relies on Mary's observations into the social atmosphere of the court under King Henry the VIII. Perhaps the most intriguing part was the relationship and interplay between the three Boleyn siblings. There's plenty of scandal to keep the plot barreling along and the end leaves you wanting to know more. In my case, the moment I ended the book was the moment I began looking up Mary's life."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book twice. Each experience was rich, and in the end of each serving, I remebered the mood from the story and it stuck with me. I'd have to say I quite admire the stubborn spirit of 'nan bullen' and also the wisdom of her sister, mary.Not only is this book detailed historically, it serves for an excellent experience. As an avid reader, I am usually going on from one book to the next. This book, however, proved to be worth a second read AND one of the most cherished it my library collection. If &quot;nan bullen&quot; still lived, (impossible nonetheless)I would thank her. Thankyou, Nan, for teaching me ambition and flirtation!**** GRUDGE WHO GRUDGE"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was given to me by a friend and I put off reading it for a while - it wasn't &quot;my kind of book.&quot; Luckily for me, I started reading it and couldn't put it down! This is the story of Anne Boleyn and her sister, Mary Boleyn, and their drive to attain the King and the throne. But, it's more than that - it's a very well written history of the people and events of the time and is fascinating to read. There's nothing dry or boring about this book. Try it - you'll like it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boylen Girl was in my pile of books waiting to be read ~ I don't know what took me so long to finally read it. I loved this book!! I loved Mary reading her story I wanted her to find true happiness and true love. Her sister Anne was something else, I was getting so mad!! I hated the way she treated Mary, Anne thought she was all high and mighty. Like when they send Mary away she didn't have any contact with her parents or brother and sister. Then When Anne is send away she gets a taste of what it felt like so I was happy about that. Mary just wants her two children and live in peace but her parents want great things from her they want her to marry the King even though he is already married but since the Queen can't have any children she can't give him a boy, but Mary doesn't want that life style and Anne does. As you keep reading along you are hoping everything will turn out good for Mary. This book deserves 5 stars great read!!Happy Reading Lisa"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"An elaboration on a well-known story could easily turn off many history buffs, but not this novel. Unique and well-developed, the reader feels pulled into the plot line and torn between wanting to savor the tantilizing details or rush headlong into the story. A very unique perspective... not for the historically squeamish. Worth the time, every time!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Narrated by Mary Boleyn, the lesser known of the Boleyn sisters, this book touches on every aspect of a good fiction novel. Love, trust, deceit, passion and romance. The author is extremely vibrant in her writing, you find yourself glued to the book and without realizing it, you have finished another 100 pages. Awesome book! I'm so glad it was picked as a book group choice."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The story of Anne Boleyn has been told numerous times over the years in various formats, so I was intrigued by this book and discovered it is just as much Mary's story as it is Anne's.Anne Boleyn's younger sister Mary catches the eye of King Henry VIII of England at the age of 14 and, at the direction of her family, becomes the king's mistress. No matter that the girl is already married, her family sees Mary's relationship with the king as a way to advance their social status - if only Mary could bear the king a son, the family's future would be secure.Mary bears the king a daughter and later has a son (whose parentage is, to this day, in dispute) and the king soon tires of her and turns his attention to Anne, whose story we all know from high school history classes. Yet, it was interesting to see the story told from the viewpoint of Mary in the first person, rather than a narrative or an historical book.Sadly, Mary was the only of the three Boleyn siblings - Mary, Anne and George - who did not have a date with the executioner. She was also the only one to marry for love, and not to advance her family. This single act caused her to be disowned by her family, although it is believed she lived a happy life.I'm a sucker for those crazy Tudors. I have read Alison Weir's \\"Six Wives of Henry VIII,\\" Elizabeth I\\" and \\"The Children of Henry VIII,\\" all of which I count among my favorite books on the Tudor period. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" has joined them on that shelf."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful. It intrigues all kind of readers, and it creates a wonderful chemistry of romance, intrigue, sex, scandal, love, evil, and every other possible emotion that can make you hate,love, and empathsize with all the characters in the book. I personally loved getting into the minds and atmosphere of the time and court of Henry VIII, and found I couldn't put the book down. Once you get to the last page, you feel yourself wishing to be able to continue experiencing the lives of the characters. I totally loved this book, and can't wait to read more from Philippa Gregory.

I could not put it down, from beginning to end, I was completely engaged. I recommend this book to everyone I know. Beautifully written and exciting.

Still a good read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My mom lended me this book about 5 years ago, but I didn't pick it up until one day when I was bored and out of reading material.However, once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down. The characters and scenery were rich, the details intriguing, and I found myself in Hever Castle with Mary, Anne and William. For those who took offense to the less-than-accurate details, it was not written for the purpose of replicating history; it's a novel, first and foremost. And while many criticize the one-dimensionality of the characters, I found both Mary and Anne to have both faults and virtues. (Admittedly, Gregory could have evened them out a bit, but what fun is that in a historical romance novel?)George, the ever-present brother, presented much-needed comic relief.I thought this was a richly told tale, resplendent in details about the Tudor era. I could envision the court, the dress and costumes, the food and entertainment of the era, the 16th century ignorance about whether the male or female determines the sex of a child, how important a male heir is, and most certainly the dominance of men over women. Even most historical non-fiction authors agree that Anne Boleyn was not a woman who susbscribed to this theory, and, in fact, was quite ruthless in her pursuit of power -- especially that with which she held over Henry VIII.In the end, it was obvious that despite his charm, hunting prowess, literary finesse and intelligence, Henry VIII became overwrought with his own power and could not clearly identify who his friends and enemies were. As such, he made poor decisions that would rock the English kingdom for years to come.Not having been a scholar of the Tudor period, this book prompted me to expand upon that interest. I just picked up \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" by Ann Reid, which is a non-fiction account that I hope will fill in the blanks.All in all, I guess I'm not so erudite that I couldn't wholeheartedly enjoy this page-turning novel, even knowing that every single detail wasn't absolute fact. Hey, I have 4 kids and grocery shop at Wal-Mart."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The story is a fascinating one and Ms Gregory has breathed life into all the characters for me. It's made me hungry for more. I've trawled the web these last couple of days reading everything I can find on the Tudors. My existing knowledge of Henry VIII was limited to schoolgirl history and I only wish I'd had this book, back in the day when History was on my timetable. You know it's a good book when you seek out any little bit of info on the web that relates to the story you've just read.I'm really amazed though, at the negative reviews here, which site 'inaccuracy' as the reason to give 1 or 2 stars. It's a work of fiction. The characters were real people, but Historical Fiction is just that - Fiction in an Historical setting.I can't believe people are saying it's a terrible book because it's not 100% accurate. It's fiction. If anyone is looking for 100% Historical accuracy, perhaps a work of non-fiction would suit better?As a work of fiction, it's a good book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What an intriguing story, you must read this book before you ever see the movie. The book is 100 times better. Not one minute spent reading is boring."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Arrived quickly. Great condition for being used.Book itself was a gret read if you are into this genre. Very well written and it held my interest the whole way through. Couldnt put it down. Fantastic."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's no secret that I like good historical fiction, but Philippa Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl literally blew me away. While it is actually the second book in the Tudor series, it was the first one published and remains, in my humble opinion, the best of the series.The Other Boleyn Girl follows a fictionalized, but surprisingly accurate account, of King Henry VIII of England's marital status & romantic involvements in the early 1500's. Mary Boleyn had been sent to France for an education on societal interactions and came to the English court at the young age of 14. Now, early 1500's 14 and present-day 14 are two completely separate animals, and so she was considered a proper lady of marrying age.Instead of being married though, she catches King Henry VIII's eye and falls madly in love with him. The novel follows their affair, because the King was still married to Lady Katherine of Aragon whom Mary served, and their love for one another. It's when Mary realizes that her family is using her to further their own interests that she understands that her future is not as secure and comfortable as it seems. There is a new woman in the court who is starting to appeal to the King. And it is the other Boleyn girl, Anne. Will Mary risk her safety and potentially her life to defy her family and king to live the life she has always wanted?I'm not even exaggerating when I say this was one of the more compelling novels and attractive characters I had read. Mary was so dynamic, I felt like she could do anything she put her mind to in the face of immense danger. She seemed to know so much and be aware of so many things that it was just unreal. Her sister was simply demented though. Philippa did a wonderful job portraying Anne as the conniving, scheming individual that she truly was. There is no doubt in this story that everyone has flaws, but the way they manage their flaws is fascinating.The setting was absolutely breathtaking as well. Philippa spends quite a bit of time and energy making sure that the scene is fully set in the reader's mind before she moves the storyline forward. It's almost as if she really wants you to experience something, that is very difficult for most people to imagine, firsthand. The clothes were opulent, the settings were mesmerizing, & the interactions were captivating. Nothing was spared in this story and it shows. This book is truly a fascinating read for court-based historical fans and anyone who loves some steaming romance scenes and betrayal.P.N. While the 2008 film \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Eric Bana was overall decent, I found the storyline deviated far too much from the book. It was obviously made more sexual for audiences and I felt that it lost some of the poetry that the story lived in. Not bad, but the book is definitely better (as it almost always is)."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Although we don't know if the \\"other\\" Boleyn girl refers to Anne Boleyn, or her younger-by-a-year sister, Mary, Mary is chosen by author Philippa Gregory to narrate this book. She is a close observer and participant in the Boleyns' schemes to advance the family during a period of turmoil as Queen Katherine of Aragon is unable to produce an heir to the throne of King Henry VIII.This is a very easy and engrossing read. I think it's better enjoyed by lovers of historical fiction, but will be appreciated by anyone.The book begins with a teenage Mary, who is newly wed to William Carey and part of Queen Katherine's court. Her sister, Anne, is being summoned from France, where she attended at that court, so she may join her sister as one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, but really so that the family may make her an advantageous marriage. At this point, \\"Annamaria\\" and \\"Marianne\\" are like yin and yang, frick and frack. Not for long.As the ambitions of the Boleyns and the Howards (the family of Anne's and Mary's mother) to advance their place in society grow, Anne and Mary are set loose as rivals to each other at court for the sole aim of capturing the attention of the King. The Boleyns sense, as do many other families (like the Seymours) that the Queen's inability to produce a son will open the door for one of their daughters to step in.Although Mary is married, her husband is forced by her family to take a backseat to the King as the King initially takes a shine to the \\"golden-haired\\" Mary. The affair continues as she bears him two children. There is a moment in the story when the King, who by this time has had a son and daughter with Mary (albeit illegitimate), privately expresses to her his belief that his marriage with Katherine was cursed and should be annulled. Even though Mary knows that, during this moment, he is vulnerable, she just cannot seem to seize the moment and suggest to him that she step into Katherine's shoes. Maybe she's prohibited by her undying (and inexplicable) loyalty to the Queen, or to her husband, or by her sense of right and wrong. Or maybe it's just Mary's good sense as she knows what a risky and dangerous proposition that would be.The drama builds as Henry's court becomes more raucous, dangerous and intriguing, no thanks, in part, to Anne. The King eventually loses interest in Mary as Anne puts on the \\"full court press\\" to usurp Mary's place as the King's favorite, in part, out of jealousy, and in part, out of her growing impatience with the family's failure to marry her as she continues to grow older and less desirable. Anne gradually gains the King's attentions as she has no problem helping him understand that Katherine must be put aside. The more Anne grows in the King's esteem, the more ruthless she becomes in her ambition and demands. I found it clever that the author painted Anne to be venomously ambitious and hateful throughout the bulk of the story, but by the end, you buy the author's premise that she got a raw deal. Also by the end, I unexpectedly despised Jane Seymour more than Anne, even though Jane was painted to be no more threatening than a fly whereas Anne was mean and nasty.It is clear that the author adores Mary, so much so that she seems to suggest that England would have been better off with Mary as Queen, and that Henry would not have had any reason (because she was so even-tempered and had bore him a son) to toss her aside.I think the author gets into a bit of a jam by making Mary the narrator/observer because then she must make Mary important and indispensable to all the key players in the story. For instance, even though Mary is supposedly despised by Anne, she is also called upon by Anne to assist her, of course, on the eve of every historical event (no doubt, so Mary can observe and talk about it). Also, Mary, a mere mistress, seems to have the King's ear and counsel, even after their affair had ended, which is a bit awkward to the story.I do ultimately think that it was interesting, although imperfect, to tell the story from Mary's perspective, as it is notable that she was the only Boleyn sibling to get out alive. She must have been an clever person to achieve that.Ms. Gregory has sold me on her ability to craft an engrossing historical fiction novel. I just can't decide which of her books I'll read next."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found this book to be a very good read, and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to read more about the love/hate relationship of sisters, the love triangles, the power struggles. After finishing this one, I read The Queen's Lover, and now I'm finishing The Queen's Fool. The books are thick but the pages turn very quickly, a wonderful historic fiction!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book - great writing, nice development of plot, and a slight blurring of fact with fiction makes this a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Transport yourself into the time of King Henry VIII!! I felt like a fly on the wall, or at least one of the courtesans watching this drama unfold.It's an amazing story, and told best here. How the women of the era wove their way through through the power, greed and deception is fascinating! I couldn't put it down...my BOOK CLUB loved this book also! It does not disappoint and I felt like I was learning something about the time period as the \\"fact\\" blend seamlessly with the fiction!ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This novel is so JUICY! It was reccommended to me by one of my best friends who is a history buff, so i had my reservations about reading it at first, thinking that it would be a bunch of facts thrown together with a simple plot - But as soon as i picked up this monster of a novel, i could not put it down!the relationships are intricate and the characters are fascinating... overall a really great read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Why can't all history lessons be embedded within the luscious words, flowing movements, and vivid descriptions of a book such as The Other Boleyn Girl? I was so taken aback by this author's historical fiction piece, to find myself curled up on the couch savory every word like the last bite of creme brulee, the last taste of a juicy steak cooked to perfection. Get started on this book, and you'll abandon reality TV, soap operas, and every other object of trashy consumerism just to turn page after page and be seduced by history.Despite the nail-biting plot twists and the wickedly delightful tug of war between the characters, this book allows the reader an opportunity to put historical fact into a realm for discussion and contemplation of many things---nepotism, politics, religion, family dynamics, marriage, and something that hits closer to home during these turblent times---leadership. Yes, I've heard about King Henry the VIII, and I knew as most probably do, that he was some kind of magnificent bastard back in his day. But, looking at these pieces of his life, while considering those he manipulated and abused, I've come to one sorry realization....he and George Bush have a lot in common! Times really haven't changed much.But, seriously, do yourself a favor, and read a beautifully written piece of historical fiction, and let it sweep you into the eyes and ears of Mary Boleyn, a side character, a person cast aside for causes born out of lust, greed, and deception. You will wish that all of your history lessons in school had been this clearly laid out and conceptually delivered."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love history and I love characters that act within the context of their historical eras-- I love the trappings to be right but more I want the characetrs to act right and though I'm no scholar it seems like everything in this book could have happened, including the thoughts and motives of the many fascinationg historical figures. Really enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl reminds me of a play, with characters constantly exiting and entering. It is Shakespearian in the motives and plotting of the players.

DEFINITELY A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE WHO LOVES HISTORICAL FICTION."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Mary Boleyn is a fresh face in the court of Henry VIII and he takes a fancy to her and her manipulative family couldn't be happier. As the Kings mistress Mary acts as a pawn for her families interests as they play for the kings love and rewards that will bring the Howard/Bolyne family to a higher possition at court. Queen Katherine, Henry's loyal wife seems incapable of providing him with his much needed son and heir and the Howards hope their Mary will be the mistress that will provide Henry with the son he needs. But the kings eyes and interests gradualy start to wander to Anne Boleyn, Mary's beautiful, strong willed sister, her friend and rival. This story is of the battle between two sisters, so different in so many ways yet both nothing to their families but steps on the families ladder to sucess. A war filled with love and hate. A family full of secrets that could be their ruin but the promise of sucess if they succeed. Told from the point of view of Mary, a character easy to fall in love with as she begins to see the corrupt greed of her family and chooses to take her life into her own hands and live for life itself rather than power and wealth. The book provides an endless supply of rich characters and provides an endless source of intrigue from cover to cover. Read it, I swear you wont regret it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this from start to end on my flight from the States to Africa. A true page turner! I couldn't put the book down. It gave me an insight about the Tudor era and sparked my curiosity to learn more about that historical period. Critics may say that Philippa's account of the era isn't entirely accurate, but bear in mind that this is fiction & she definitely keeps her readers intrigue from start till end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Forget about your life, forget about sleep. This book will take over until you have finished reading every last word. I like historical novels that pull me into the times, the setting, the mood.A few reviewers found fault with the historical accuracy. I am no expert. I am glad they set the record straight. The author should consider adding historical notes. But this is worth reading as is 'The Queens Fool'. I'll get around to her new one in this series eventually."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of those fastpaced \\"can't put it down\\" novels. I have heard several people complain about the historical inaccuracies within the novel. However, if you can put those aside and accept the book's universe as Gregory unfolds it, it is a joy to explore. If you enjoy historical fiction and are interested in Tudor England, I would highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have always been a fan of historical fiction, especially the Tudor era. When I saw that there was a book about the Boleyn girls I was very intrigued, since Mary Boleyn is an ancestor of mine. I already knew much about Mary and Anne, but this brought everything to life.It was a phenominal read. I literally could not put it down. When I wasn't reading the book, I found myself thinking about the characters and the events constantly.I suggest this book for anyone who likes the Tudor era, but anyone in general. Don't be intimidated by it's length. There was never a dull moment, and you won't want to miss the end, which is the most exciting part."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was completely enthralled by the fact that Anne Boleyn had a sister who was mistress to the king! This story has it ALL--romance, intrigue, betrayal, lust, and a lot of history. I've read this book fifty times and look forward to reading it fifty more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book out of interest in the Tudor times. I've read quite a few disappointing historicals in my time. What with the pages and pages of tedious description to tread through in some of the stories. This is most certainly not the case in The Other Boleyn Girl! It captures the essence of the period in the most effective way. I felt literally as if I was there in this time and space. The author pays attention to details, such as food, apparrel, and community.Anne Boleyn was drawn as a villain, which shatters the empathy a lot of folks felt for her. I too felt sorry for her at one time, but that's done with, though no one really knows if she is deserving of symapthy or resentment. The long and short of it is that I couldn't put this book down. It is most highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For the most part, this was a gripping story that revived my interest in the Tudor period, the kind of story with a &quot;you were there&quot; feel.However, I gave it four stars instead of five. One reason was that, for all its compelling qualities, it did lack a little in the drama department. When the final tragedy sweeps over George and Anne, witnessed by Mary, I wasn't as engaged as I thought I would be. This may be an inbuilt problem with making a minor character the center of the story. Anne's trial, imprisonment and execution are experienced by Mary only at second hand, or from a distance. I wanted more.The second reason (SPOILER alert) has to do with the author's choice to take seriously the accusation of incest between Anne and her brother. Her reason for doing so--that in Anne's desperation for a son, she took a lover, and George would have been the &quot;obvious choice&quot;--seemed far-fetched. It's difficult to imagine any situation where one's brother would seem the &quot;obvious&quot; choice to father your child, no matter how desperate you were.That Anne might take a lover I could believe, and that she would trust George as her go between, absolutely; but that a woman raised in such a highly religious culture, and surrounded by admirers, would turn to her brother? It makes no sense, except as a sensational plot device.The fact that before his execution, George confessed to homosexuality but not incest, supports this. It is as if he were saying, &quot;This was what I really did.&quot;Henry had a string of stillborn children with Katherine. Ironically, another stillbirth is probably the best proof that Henry was the father. (If Anne had taken a lover, or even produced a healthy boy with Henry, it's interesting to think how different history would have been.)The accusations, along with witchcraft and multiple adulteries, seemed obviously design to blacken Anne's name, so that Henry would be justified not merely in divorce but execution.Henry had followed a similar with Katherine, convincing himself the marriage was invalid and, crucially, it was really Katherine's fault.Probably it was also meant to salve his conscience. Having gone to such great lengths to put Anne, a commoner, on the throne, only a very good reason would seem to justify setting her aside.Mere adultery apparently wasn't enough. But an incestuous witch who trafficked with the Devil? Who could blame Henry then? I think it shows the depth of his hatred, and perhaps fear, of her. Certainly, there was more than a touch of cruelty in persuading Anne to sign annullment papers (making her only child illegitimate, with no right to the throne) in the belief that she would be spared, only to take her life anyway.In any case, Gregory's unorthodox interpretation made it difficult for me to connect with the story after a certain point. Not difficult enough, however, to dock the book more than one star."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in the Tudor Court.Gregory does a fantastic job of developing an engrossing story with the soap-opera of Henry VIII's court at its center. I've heard differing opinions on just how historically accurate this novel is, but in the end I think it matters little. Gregory stays close enough to the facts to be believable and ultimately it is a work of fiction.My only critique is that she works so hard at sanctifying Mary Boleyn while villifying Anne. She asserts on several occasions that Mary is as preoccupied with family and personal advancement as Anne, but the story she tells seems to indicate that Mary is an unwitting participant in all the intrigue.In the end, that one flaw vanishes in the sheer beauty and scope of the novel. It is not an undertaking for the faint of heart, at over 600 pages, but it is well worth it. I found it to be a quick read despite its length.Here's to, as Eddie Izzard would say, \\"sex, death and religion in an interesting night-time telly kind of way\\"!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Excellent book! I didn't think I was going to be interested, but I couldn't put it down. All I did for three day was read The Other Boleyn Girl. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Yes, it is THAT good. I must say that so far this is my favorite read of the summer. I didn't know what to expect, the concept of a common history told by an uncommon character (Anne Boleyn's sister Mary) is touchy.But I loved it, for Gregory not only writes well, but she has quite an imagination. I was impressed and intrigued by the way she took a history known to many, many people (we all know Anne's fate here) and made it fresh with murder and tons of dark little Boleyn family secrets. Mary, Anne's younger, obedient to the end, golden sister tells the tale of how the family gave, risked, and gambled everything, often at too high a price, to put Anne in the King's bed and ultimately on to the throne.And I also love the way she has made Anne Boleyn out to be a complete monster in this novel, when she did meet her fate I have to say that I didn't feel too bad for her.A must read for anyone who is looking for a great story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For the most part I liked this book. It was an interesting approach to have Mary, Anne's sister, narrate the story. It's a twist, and I admire the author for trying it. However, I do believed the story dragged on in some parts. At times I felt as if it would never end. I don't blame the author so much as I do the editor who could have fixed this problem. I enjoyed Mary's evolution, but I was annoyed by her constant whining about her kids. Overall, I would have to say I liked this book. But if you are a die hard history freak, who wants every detail correct, you may not like this book. The author does take some liberties."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Flawlessly and artfully written, I can't say the last time I so enjoyed a book! This book takes you deep into the intrigue of the English court and the story of the Boleyn family's strategic political rise through the bartering of it's daughters to a lecherous, philandering king. Told from the perspective of the less infamous oldest sister, and the king's first Boleyn mistress, Mary; Historical fact is seamlessly blended with fiction in an exciting tale of political intrigue, backstabbing sibling rivalry and one woman's insatiable and unstoppable ambition to be crowned queen. I couldn't put it down!--This isn't the history they taught you in school!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you are reading the Customer Reviews section, don't bother...JUST BUY THE BOOK!

Then, you'll find yourself thinking about it day and night and wishing that the author would write a sequel, exploring the generations to come!The Other Boleyn Girl gives an entirely new and surprising peek into the lives of the Tudors in England. Anglophiles will love the book for it's modern-day slant on the historical record, and history-phobics will also love it because of the author's ability to convey fantastic visual images without bogging the reader down into unnecessary details. The 600+ pages will fly by so quickly that it feels like reading a book half it's size."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had just finished reading \\"The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers\\" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory is a talented writer, I'll give her that, but she should stay far away from actual historical characters. Mary Boleyn as an innocent girl of 12? Come on! I'm not really against Mary, but she was actually the closest thing to a whore that the Boleyn family had (she was sent home from France around 1520 because her indiscretions were enough to shock the most indiscrete court in Europe) and was no where near the dramatic heroine portrayed here. She wasn't a bad woman, but she didn't really do that much. Mary was around 20 when she was married, far from the child Gregory makes her out to be. Anne wasn't as much of a b*tch as Gregory likes to portray her as, and she and Mary never fought over Henry VIII. I could rant on and on about the historical inaccuracies, but I think I'll just let you know those main ones. When I read this novel, I had to close my eyes and pretend that this was not based off real people and historical events to take the least bit of joy out of it. If you can live with this knowledge, go ahead and read TOBG because, as I mentioned, Philippa Gregory is a talented writer. I just don't want to hear another person quoting something out of this book and calling it fact..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. It was well written and engaging and I found myself not able to put this book down. In the end I wanted more and became hooked on this writer. Everything she writes is amazing (Except the Wideacre trilogy which I hated) But Everything else is well worth the money"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a fascinating and enthrawling book. You are catipulted into the lives of this family and render yourself unable to pull yourself out of the downward spiral of the Boleyns'. This book not only gave you a look into the life of Anne Boleyn and her family, but a look at Henry VIII and the people of the court, amazingly filled with beauty, laughter, love and manipulation."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Like eating a whole box of truffles!!!!!! You just cannot stop yourself from sheer delight! I have NEVER been a historical fiction fan, and I know this may not be the most accurate book- but this was one of the most enjoyable books I have read. I could not put this book down...I knew what the ending would ultimately be- Anne's beheading, yet still could not wait to see what happened to Mary. I read at least two books a week and as a result go through a lot of garbage- I have recommended this book to everyone I know that loves a good read- Not a lot of deep thinking involved, just a delightful story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had some reservations about reading this novel, as I am not a history buff, and I could not see myself wading through over 600 pages of middle English dialogue and melodramatic prose. I am so glad I took the chance.Told in the first-person narrative of Mary Boleyn, Anne's younger sister, this is a fictional aacount of a family of courtiers in Tudor England. The novel begins a little over a year after Mary (aged 13) has been married to a British nobelman. All sorts of things are happening for her. Her family is gaining power within the monarchy, she is reasonably happily married, and her older sister Anne is returning from the French court. Mary has caught the eye of Henry VIII, much to the Queen Katherine's chagrin. Pressed by her family, and in particular her sister, Mary begins an illicit affair with the king. Two children later, Henry has moved on from Mary to her sister Anne. The story then shifts to Mary's first-hand account of her sister's reign and eventual execution.Make no mistake; this is definitely Mary's story. While a great deal of the novel is spent on Mary's version of what happened to Anne, there is no loss of who Mary is as a person and of what happens to her life. I highly recommend this novel as it paints a rich characterization of one of the most fascinating and tumultous periods of English history, with a plausible plot and witty dialogue. Gregory has deftly captured the ruthlessness and greed of the noble class, and paints a particularly ambitious portrait of Anne Boleyn.As we read how Mary matures, we suffer with her, especially during her adolescent phase. It's difficult to discern if Mary is a worthy heroine, or a complacent whiner. Good! Just like a teenager. We see her through her first love, the births of her children, and finding true love. There's not a false notion here. For fiction, this is unparalleled. Great fun!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Marvelous, fresh version of the Anne Boleyn episode of history, narrated by her younger sister, Mary. I found myself totally caught up in the story, even though I've read and seen many versions of the tale of Mary's sister Anne, Henry the VIII's second wife. I had a difficult time putting the book down and could not wait to get back to it. The times and lifestyles are so clearly dileneated that I felt part of them."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thought this book was awsome. Im used to reading period peices like Jane Austen and seeing the purity of the Olden days, but this book was more the coruption. It kept me hooked on every page and had so many twists and turns i couldnt put it down without it being in my mind for the rest of my days."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was very interesting, although very long, I read it in record time because it was so hard to put down. It opened my eyes to the treacherous ways of the old courts of England and it fanned out beautifully from the facts we know about Anne Boleyn and her family's lives into an interesting and tragic, fictional account."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a GREAT book, I'm an avid reader and I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Tudor English History. Althought is not technically a true account, it does have some historical truth and the thoughts and feelings of the main character are absolutely riviting.. Great Read A+++++++"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought the book on a Friday afternoon and finished it in bed on Sunday night - as another reviewer said, don't let the size of the book put you off! This book was satisfying from a historical and fictional perspective without bogging down in the details that can stall a plot. I was very pleased with this book and plan to seek out other titles by this author. This book is the ultimate &quot;smart&quot; beach book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"After being sooooo disappointed by &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot; by Gabaldon, I was looking for a new author to try out. And I must say that this is what I was looking for. It does have some historical inaccuracies, but it is FICTION. The plot was great and the characters were really well done. It read so fast that I was done with the book in 4 days, SIGH. My best compliment that I can give the author is that I am now looking at the library for her older books...."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm going to be upfront with readers of this review, I am not a very smart girl. So many of you giving negative reviews really know your Tudors' History. Everything I know about the Tudors stems from *cringe* the television show (love it), Wikipedia, and various other websites around the internet.But even I, with my very limited knowledge of Tudors History, was seriously annoyed with the mistakes in the book - especially when you consider how self serving they were to the picture perfect main character. I have never seen ANY historian claim (even on Wiki dang it!) that Mary was the younger of the sisters. If I remember right she was actually likely the eldest of the living Boelyn children. This makes sense considering that Mary was the first presented at court and the first married. As another reviewer said her being the youngest adds nothing to the storyline so why not just get it right? I think PG was trying to make Mary as innocent as possible and being just a young teenager made her more likeable to the reader perhaps. However pretty much everything I've read about Mary agrees on the fact that she had some miles on her (classy terminology FTW) when she arrived to the English court. I think the fact that she married someone who was generally deemed below Boelyn level is proof that this is true. It's pointed out how great the Boelyn/ Howard family a million times in this book and someone as pretty as Mary was said to be would have probably fetched a husband from an even better family...unless she had a bad reputation.In PG's mind sisters are apparently polar opposites. Since Mary is blonde, sweet, and shy, Anne is dark, vile, and loud. I have to say this author really does not seem to like Miss Anne Boelyn very much. This Anne is nasty to everyone, clever but somehow incredibly stupid at the same time, thinks negatively of everyone around her, and even tries to seduce her gay brother several times (what the heck?) in the book. Also, pretty much every thing that Anne was accused of, things that most historians agree are probably false and made up so she could be executed without much argument, are true in this novel. If a person only read this book and never anyhting else about Anne Boelyn they would not have a very good image of her, when in reality Anne was said to have done lots of nice things in her short reign as Queen of England.As I said before, I am not very smart. I do not usually pick up on misogynistic language and themes - even obvious ones (Snow White anybody?)- but in this book you're practically slapped across the face with it. Mary is quiet, shy, conventionally beautiful, listens to her male handlers (for the most part) and gives into the King's sexual desires as soon as he asks. She is rewarded with beautiful children, a loving husband, and a nice quiet life in the country (because being a farmer's wife in the 16th century was easy as churning butter I guess). Anne, on the other hand, is mean, agressive, sexual (while withholding herself from the king so as not to be another used and disgraced woman), and most of all DARES to think of herself as equal to or (le gasp!) better than the men in her life. No, these behaviors would have NOT been acceptable in Tudor England from a woman, but this book was written in the 21st century by a female author, no less. A little perspective please?So yes, go ahead and tell me that maybe I'm just too dumb to understand this novel, but I think i'll stick with other adaptions that don't take such a negative veiw of poor Anne."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"Henry the VIII and his fistful of wives\\" has been popular reading for me and my contempraries who grew up in Indiain the 1960s. I recently had time to read \\"The other Boleyn girl\\". I inhaled it rather quickly because the topic was of interest to me and also because Phillipa Gregory cast of characters was very predictable. I agree with C. Spinney \\"tunispinney\\" (Reston, VA United States) that it is more like a pithy gossip novel. The historical facts could have been handled more delicately and the characters brought to life in a more sensitive manner. They do appear predicatable like a comic book. Mary is the \\"dumb-blond\\" Anne is the\\" Mata-Hari\\". Henry is the \\"pompous-...\\". Jane Seymour the \\" Simpering-ninny\\".....I think readers who loved this book just like to eat their meals predigested. I have an interesting idea though, I wonder if someone else would write this book with a modern twist. What if ultrasound, amniocentesis and genetic counselling was available to KIng Henry and his wives? Probably Endland would have considered artificial insemination????Boggles the mind, but perhaps fewer queens would have gotten the axe."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I don't mind that there are historical inaccuracies in this book. The story is an interesting one that I enjoyed reading about. However, the book went on and on for so long about the story that it became dreadfully boring and tedious. This story could only capture my interest for 250 or so pages.The girls are fixated on their ambitious goals, they are shallow and vain, and they are treated terribly by men. Every now and then Mary's unique and good side comes out. Well so what. They are still boring and unlikeable.Why do people like reading this? Is it the sex? Is it the court? It is the same thing, page after page after page. The same thing happens during every meeting with the King, during every hunt with the King, during every glance at the Queen, during every secret family meeting. The only part I found interesting was the witchcraft and incest, which wasn't a large part of the book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved it. This is historical fiction at its finest. Depicting Mary's POV, very eloquently written. A very provocative story with fascinating characters. I found myself ingnoring the world around me 'till I had this one finished. A fine piece of historical fiction. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The historical inaccuracies started in the very first chapter. Everybody knows Mary Boleyn was the older of the two sisters, that she went to France with her father, and that she had an affair with King Francis while there. King Henry VIII never executed anybody for simply questioning his ability to father children although he did execute people who rebelled or plotted against him. Did the writer not feel it necessary to read even one Anne Boleyn or Henry VIII biography?The writing is about what one would expect of a high school student. The narrative voice attributed to Mary Boleyn is not even remotely believable as that of a teenager, much less as one who actually lived in the Tudor period. The use of a character to ask a stupid question that a real person in that situation would not have to ask is a transparent device to reveal information to the reader. Most professional writers realize this.I got fifteen or twenty pages in and realized that neither the writing nor the historical versimilitude was going to improve. So I threw the book away. Out of the thousands of books I've bought over the years, this is only the second one I've thrown away before finishing it.I can't imagine why any publisher would have bought this book, why any professional reviewer would have recommended it, or why anyone would want to make it into a movie given its clear lack of merit. It would have been far more ethical to have the author change some of the names, invent an imaginary country, and throw in a wizard or an ogre so as to market this book as what it really is: badly written fantasy."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"There's only one thing worse than this book - and that's the television programme that was made from it. Don't know if it's been screened in the US yet but believe me, it was truly terrible."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Historical mistakes aside, and there are many (take for example the age of the Boleyn sisters), this book is just poorly developed.There is very little historical in this historical fiction, but I would be willing to overlook that if there was a compelling lead character or cast of characters.Alas, it is not to be. Anne Boleyn plays the wicked step-sister and Mary a rather disappointing narrator. A passive character can be an interesting character and the inner-turmoils, the love and hate between siblings can make for powerful stuff; but here it is watered down into melodramatic pastiches.The author was not able to draw me into the time period nor the characters. In fact, the characters would have been more at home in a modern setting, in a Desperate Housewives universe than Tudor England.The writing is not extremely lyrical or brilliant to forgive the mistakes I've mentioned above.Overall, I found it a rather mediocre read. A shame, for I rather wanted to like it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was so excited to read this book for a number of reasons: I am familiar with the history of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, I read and enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's book \\"Wideacre,\\" and I heard good things about this novel. What a surprise when I opened it, read the first 100 pages or so, and found it extremely mediocre. I'm honestly surprised that so many people enjoyed it as to give it a 4.5 rating on Amazon.Some of the bad reviews bashed this book for being historically inaccurate, but I won't, because the author seems to have done her research and she has a right to add/remove whatever from her own book to make it flow. One of the things that bothered me most was the anachronistic writing. The characters said phrases that would never be heard in pre-Elizabethan England (for example, Anne had a \\"sexy little laugh\\"?). And for another thing, are the vivid descriptions of sexual acts really necessary? In one scene, Mary tells Anne exactly how to pleasure King Henry while staying a virgin, by using her mouth or letting him watch her, etc. etc.Her characters are extremely inconsistent, especially the title character of Mary Boleyn. The heroine of the book should be someone you can sympathize with, not scorn. She is a weak, whiny little thing, and her stupidity is truly fitting for a dumb blonde. I realize that Phillipa Gregory needs to draw comparisons between the milder, feeble-minded Mary and the quick-witted, vivacious Anne Boleyn, but really, make your main character more sympathetic. Mary's relationships are extremely inconsistent and confusing. At times, she loves Anne very much (though it's hard to see why) and at other times, she wishes that her sister's ship had sunk in the sea, a violent wish you would never have for a beloved family member. At times, she is head over heels in love with Henry, and at other times, she couldn't care less if he slept with her sister. She professes to adore and admire Queen Katherine, yet betrays her consistently. She loves her husband William, then hates him and wishes she could escape and return to court.The funniest thing is to read about how Mary, a pampered, spoiled girl who wears silks and sleeps in a rich chamber in Henry's castle, longs for the life of a farmer. She whines about it over and over, how she could leave her glamorous and luxurious life as a queen's lady and go live on a farm, washing clothes, feeding pigs, pulling in the crops. It's laughable and not realistic.The only bearable character in this book is Queen Katherine, portrayed as a dignified, graceful, loyal woman.I am honestly surprised at the reviews this book got. If you want a good story that portrays Anne Boleyn as more than just a crazy psycho maneater, try Jean Plaidy's book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was intrigued by the idea of reading a book about Mary Boleyn. Unfortunately, this is a book mostly about Anne Boleyn, as narrated by Mary - the book ends with Anne and George Boleyn's beheading, although Mary survived them by a number of years. I was really disappointed by this; I would actually have been more interested in reading about her later life, which is rarely covered in history books. Ah well, I see that Karen Harper's Passion's Reign, recently reissued asThe Last Boleyn: A Novelhas gotten good reviews; I'll give that a shot.It's not very good history - I give it three stars only because it was it was readable and held my interest at the beach. When I got home, I rushed to my books on the Tudors; no, I was not remembering wrong, this is filled with errors, as other reviewers have pointed out. I will point out another: I know of no evidence that Anne wanted to adopt her nephew, nor do I think it would have made her more valuable to Henry. Outside of the fact that it is not clear that the boy was Henry's son, he already had an acknowledged illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond. Henry seems to have doubted that he could successfully leave the throne to Richmond, so I cannot see how the belated acknowledgment of another illegitimate son would help. Her nephew was Anne's ward, but widows were not usually the guardians of their minor children at this point, indeed they were often given into the \\"care\\" of avaricious strangers, so it seems as likely that Anne was being protective as predatory. I leave it to the reader to decide whether historical inaccuracies bother them or not, but I think they should be aware of them.Gregory occasionally picks up on some interesting angles: Mary is somewhat ambivalent about Katharine of Aragon. On the one hand, her family is trying to bring about the Queen's downfall, on the other, she admires Katharine and feels guilty about her participation. I also liked the scenes of Mary with her grandmother when she is in exile from the court.I am something of an Anne Boleyn fan, but I understand why people don't like her. What I can't understand is that none of the anti-Anne writers seem to be able to imagine her as a three dimensional person - I thought that writers always had trouble making the virtuous as interesting as the villainous. Anne should at least be a clever and alluring (but not beautiful) seductress a la Milady DeWinter in the Three Musqueteers. In this book, as in Suzanne Dann'sThe Queen of Subtleties: A Novel of Anne Boleynand numerous others, Anne is once again a caricature of a shrill, coarse harpy - how could Henry have stood a single hour with such a person? The story is a bit crude and torrid for my tastes - the sex scenes were too many and too detailed and sometimes downright implausible. The relationship between the sisters never makes much sense - it's not so much complex as inconsistent.Overlooking the historical errors, it's not a particularly good novel, but certainly not the worst that I've read. It certainly didn't inspire me to read more of Philippa Gregory. I finally picked up her novel about Katharine of Aragon, but I didn't think that it was even as good as this.For Philippa Gregory fans and people (and we are legion) who read just about anything set during this era."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Throughout the centuries Mary Boleyn has been portrayed as either a simple little ... who was too easy going to go for the crown or as a helpless victim. This book goes a long way toward making you see Mary as something else. Is this the real story? Perhaps or perhaps not. This is historical FICTION afterall. The real Mary not only outlived her brilliant siblings but managed to find marital happines. It's a fascinating story and well told. My favorite Boleyn book is The Concubine by Norah Lofts. This book definitely deserves to sit on the same shelf."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I know this book has gotten a lot of buzz and reviews already, even more so now that there's a movie coming out, but I'll go ahead and throw in my two cents.Since I was a teenager I've been an avid reader of everything to do with the Tudor dynasty, from the Wars of the Roses through Elizabeth's reign, so there was no chance I wasn't picking this one up! I applaud Philippa Gregory for going at this through a previously obscure viewpoint - that of Mary Boleyn, Anne's older sister. Before this book, I don't think most people were even remotely aware of her existence. Not that they should be - the poor girl was just another one of Henry's playthings, but Gregory fleshes her out beautifully. At only fourteen years old and already married to a courtier her family had chosen for her, Mary catches the king's eye and soon becomes his mistress. This is at a time when Henry is still young and virile, and considered one of the most handsome men in England, and Mary, like many other women before her, is enthralled by him. She bears him two children before her ambitious younger sister, Anne, displaces her in Henry's affections. Not an unusual or particularly gripping circumstance in and of itself, but it's Gregory's portayal of the Boleyn/Howard family and their ruthless ambition to win court favor and power that is so compelling. Both Mary and Anne are simply pawns to be used by their parents and uncle, and personal happiness is of absolutely no importance whatsoever. They're bartered for like common prostitutes, and the brutal coldness of it sends a shiver down the spine. The complex relationship between Mary and Anne - part sisterly love and devotion, part bitter jealousy and rivalry - also rings uncomfortably true, and illuminates just how insidiously a larger family dynamic can wreak havoc on a relationship that might have been healthier had it been allowed to flourish away from all the scheming and manipulation of those with a bigger agenda. We all know how it ends - with Anne's head in a basket - but we come away breathing a sigh of relief, at least, for Mary, who manages to elude the axe herself and live out the rest of her days in peace with a man she loves. It's that personal growth of Mary's that will hit home for a lot of women.Readers should remember, of course, that ultimately this is a novelized account and there are some things that shouldn't be taken as fact, such as the always-titillating accusation against Anne of having a sexual relationship with her brother George and bearing a horribly deformed, stillborn child by him. That and other speculation has always been bandied about, but none of it is proven fact. Keeping that in mind, this is a wonderful read that brings that particularly fascinating, troubled period in history to glorious life.(For a great read about Anne Boleyn herself, I recommend Mistress Anne by Carolly Erickson. I read it last year and thought it was terrific. It doesn't shy away from the truth - that Anne was ruthlessly ambitious in her quest to become queen - but it's one of the few studies that really portray her as a whole, flawed woman and not just a scheming witch. Highly recommended)."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Although the author uses overused descriptions of sexual desire and at times the novel is suggestive of a tabloid romance, this is a fascinating fictionalized history. It graphically portrays the repressed role of women during the reign of Henry VIII, and brings that entire era into colorful 3-D. I read all 660 pages in one week and could barely put it down to go to work. This was my first book by this author and it has spurred me on to read others."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory's &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; is an utterly fascinating and masterfully written story. While there are a few places where Gregory has taken more artistic liberty with history than I would have liked, the overall effect of the book as a story in itself is terrific. Most people will have heard of Anne Boleyn, the ill-fated second wife of England's King Henry VIII and mother of Queen Elizabeth I. Little attention, however, is paid to Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister. Mary was one of Henry's many mistresses and had two children by him, but few texts say much else about her. She is, in every sense, the &quot;other Boleyn girl&quot; of the title. Therefore, Gregory's choice of Mary as the narrator for this story lends it a fresh and intriguing perspective on life in the Tudor court and her sister's well-known rise and fall.The book opens in 1521, with a young and naive 13-year-old Mary watching the execution of her uncle, the Duke of Buckinghamshire. It then skips ahead to the following year, when Anne returns from France and enters service alongside her sister as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine of Aragon. Though historians are not entirely certain which Boleyn girl was the eldest, the author has chosen, for this story, to place Anne's birth one year ahead of Mary's. As it becomes apparent that the Queen is unlikely to provide the King with a male heir, and also that Henry has taken a fancy to the nubile Mary, the Boleyn family is quick to push this youngest Boleyn girl into the King's bed. Their hope is that she will bear him a son and that Henry might eventually marry her. They would then be blood relations to the future King of England, making them the most powerful family in the country.Mary quickly provides Henry with two children - first a daughter and then a son. After the second child is born, however, the King's attraction to Mary begins to wane. It is then that Anne decides to play for the King's favor herself. The two sisters find themselves to be both fierce rivals and each other's only allies at the same time. Eventually Mary steps aside as Anne aspires to the greatest prize of all, the Queenship of England. From here on we see the Boleyn girls take very different courses in life. Anne must do everything she can to hold Henry's attention and maintain her position. Mary, meanwhile, wants nothing more than to leave the duplicitious world of the court behind and settle into a peaceful life in the country. But she cannot be free while Anne needs her help. We watch Mary struggle with her opposing duties and desires right up until the end of the story in 1536.While the story is excellent, I do have a few quibbles with Gregory's twists on history. The real Anne Boleyn was not so cold and heartless as she is portrayed to be in this novel. She was simply highly ambitious and lacking in propriety and discretion. Likewise, Mary was not as overwhelmingly innocent and virtuous as Gregory would have us believe. She, too, was ambitious, and schemed along with her family. I must admit, however, that for the sake of the story these adjustments by the author are beneficial. What disturbs me more is Gregory's implication that Anne had an affair with her brother, George Rochford. This was, of course, one of the accusations that led to her execution, but most modern historians agree that it is highly unlikely that it actually happened. An excellent book for more information on Anne Boleyn is Alison Weir's &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; - I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about any of Henry's wives.Despite the fact that Gregory made some alterations to Mary's and Anne's dispositions, she nevertheless did a spot-on job with most of the other key players in the book. Her portrayal of King Henry VIII in particular was excellent. Based on all I have read about him (and I've read quite a bit), she has captured his personality perfectly. We see his transformation over time from the robust, fit, flirtatious youth to the obese and moody tyrant of his elder days. In fact, Gregory seems to have a gift for showing changes in a character's personality over time. She has done the same thing with Mary. At the beginning of the book she is young and almost irritatingly naive, but by the end she has grown into a strong, intelligent, and well-rounded woman. It is fascinating to watch these changes unfold.This is the first of Philippa Gregory's novels that I have read, but I'll definitely be reading more in the future. She is a gifted writer and I like her style. There is enough of a factual basis to keep the story plausible, but she adds her own interpretations that lend much intrique and excitement. Though the book takes place in the 16th century, Gregory has modernized the dialogue to a point where it still sounds authentic but is much easier to read. This is definitely a worthwhile book for any historical fiction buff, and while it's not a completely accurate history of the time, it is nevertheless a colorful look at the Tudor court and a fascinating story. Don't take it as a history lesson, but definitely do read this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am torn between love and hate of this work. On one hand, it is true that the court intrigue is rendered in fascinating detail. And characterizations are generally quite fulsome and believable. But in addition to the sometimes weak writing alluded to by other reviewers, Gregory seems to slip into full Jacqueline Susann gear from time to time. A Harlequin romance is still a Harlequin romance, even if it is set in Tudor England."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Lately, I have been really into historical fiction, so when the clerk at Borders recommended this, I figured I'd give it a try. At first, I couldn't get into it. But within an hour, I was hooked. Later I was rushing home from work to see how the story would unfold. I knew little of the history behind it, which made it more interesting for me. (I think history buffs could enjoy it as well though.) I simply could not stop reading this book! It is so well researched that I felt I learned a lot about the time period as well as being so entertained. It's long and detailed, but the result is a rich plot and complex characters."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a great example of not only wonderful historical fiction but a great book. I really loved Mary and her story. It is cleanly written and fun, I actually felt like a member of Henry's court."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Good old love em and leave em Henry. Philippa Gregory tells a good tale - the characters come to life and the story is well worth telling. I didn't know the depth of the relationship of Mary Boleyn with Henry the VIII. In many books she is just a passing footnote - here its semi-center stage, after all there was her sister, Anne."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl tells the story of Mary Boleyn, sister to the infamous Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII. Mary becomes caught up in a series of political intrigues, as her family plots to become more powerful, especially against the Seymour family. Mary gives birth to Henry's child; in the meantime, Anne swoops in to take her place as Henry's mistress.Serving as backdrop is Henry VIII's court in the 16th century, where Henry and Katherine of Aragon's marriage is coming to an end. Tired of Katherine for not being able to produce a male heir, Henry breaks away from the Catholic Church in England and starts his own, so that he may divorce his wife. Philippa Gregory describes all of this in startling detail, as we watch Anne and Mary Boleyn vie for the King's affection. Power and status is what drives everybody involved. Its a fascinating look into life at court under the reign of Henry VIII.We get to see what Anne Boleyn was really like. Of course, we've heard stories, but I was amazed to see just what kinds of things she could do. Mary was the best kind of narrator for this novel, as we got to see firsthand the court and its going-ons. We often see Katherine of Aragon depicted in the history books as the frumpy, housfrou; here she becomes a real, genuine, loyal woman, who wouldn't give up her religion, no matter how much she loved her husband. That spoke of real character and courage on her part.The book takes us up to Anne's beheading. Again dissatisfied with the fact that he does not have a male heir, Henry trumps up charges of adultery against Anne. The ending is frightening, an account of what such a gruesome moment might have been like. It is said that, when the executioner lifted up Anne's head afterwards, the mouth moved. Gregory uses exquisite details to describe this event, and many others throughout the book.I've read many other works on historical fiction, and none other compares to The Other Boleyn Girl. It is very definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Truthfully, I can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Initially I got this book from the library because I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it has turned out to be the best historical novel I have ever read (and that's saying something). Gregory is a master at writing; take her character of Anne Boleyn for example: sometimes she was so horrible that I looked forward to her death, but at other times you can't help but feel sorry for her. I think that telling the story from the view of Mary, the &quot;other Boleyn girl&quot; and Anne's rival, was an excellent choice, as it offered great insight into a woman's life at court during the reign of Henry VIII. Yes, this story does have a lot of romance in it, but I really feel that it's tastefully done and certainly doesn't subtract from the quality. All in all, an excellent book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I picked this book up by chance at the grocery store and read 300 pages the first day, staying up way too late. The next morning I was late to work because I foolishly picked up the book again during breakfast and could not put it down. So many people know the fate of Anne Boleyn, and you would think that knowledge would spoil the suspense of a book like this, but Gregory plays it so masterfully that it becomes an asset, especially since the narrator is her sister Mary, about whom most people know nothing. The language and pacing of the novel are nothing less than genius, and the characterization is stunningly real. I can't say enough about the wonder that is The Other Boleyn Girl. Get your copy ASAP."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I LOVED this book! I don't really like reading historical novels, but this book was amazing. I could not put it down and would read well into the night because I could not get enough. The author does such a wonderful job with the characters, you feel sorry for Mary and how horrible her family was to her, but at the same time, you quickly begin to despise Anne and how awful a woman she was, especially to her sister. I found myself surfing the internet reading up on Henry VIII because I didnt know much about that time in history. Before reading this book, I would never have been that interested in the English monarchy. If I could rate this book a 10 I would. I would rank this up there with &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. Buy this book, you will love it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I purchased the hardcover when I visited London in January 2002, I was so facinated by Philippa Gregory manner of emblishing her stories with human passion and historical facts. I tried to purchase the book soon after in the states and it was not out yet. In fact, I found only two hardcovers. Now that the paperback is out, I have given each of my friends a copy. After reading this book, I ask myself why we don't incorporate European History in our schools. It is far more interesting, to me anyways."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"...but an even better story of a girl's journey to womanhood. Philipa Gregory's Mary Boleyn was a three dimensional character who sprang to life in the pages of the book. Mary Boleyn was her family's pawn, married off at an early age and tossed in the king's bed shortly thereafter. But as the story unfolds, Mary finds herself and finally has the strength to marry for love.Gregory's ability to weave a fictional story into a historical work was breathtaking."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"_The Other Boleyn Girl_ is an engrossing and often saddening novel about Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn, and her sister Mary, who was Henry's mistress before Anne snagged him. Mary and Anne share a deep bond and a deeper rivalry, born of the fact that their family views them merely as pieces to be played in a great game of social climbing. Their value is equal only to what sort of advantages they can bring to the family. Love, marriage, honor? All are sacrifices to be laid upon the altar of ambition.Sweet, romantic Mary, newly married, catches the eye of the King, and at the urging of the family, leaves her husband and becomes Henry's mistress. During her pregnancy with the King's bastard son, her family pushes Anne into the King's eye so that he will not stray to a girl from another family. But Anne, her heart hardened by losing the man she loved, is playing for the crown, not for love or for a few extra estates. Soon Henry is captivated by the mysterious Anne and will turn the world upside down to have her.The rest is history, but Gregory manages to keep us reading even though we know exactly what will happen to Anne. We see the formerly dignified court become a playground for spoiled children once Henry declares that he answers only to himself; we see the handsome and sympathetic Henry become the biggest of the spoiled children himself, growing fat, drunk, and fickle. We see Anne's high-strung desperation growing to the point of near-madness as she fails to give the King a son, and the doomed and strange relationship between Anne and her brother George. We witness the King's head turn from maddening Anne to the insufferably sweet Jane Seymour. And as the whole court goes to hell in a handbasket, we also watch Mary find love with an obscure gentleman farmer.Anne taunts Mary when she becomes queen; Mary will henceforth be only \\"the other Boleyn girl\\", forgotten by history, while everyone will know Anne's name. But which is more important? asks this book. Anne's name is still familiar to schoolchildren, but she lived a desperate life and ended up missing her head. Mary is barely remembered, and those who do recall her only snicker that she was a trollop too dumb to win marriage from the King, but she lived a life of contentment. Anne's motto was \\"The Most Happy\\", but perhaps that title must be given to Mary."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the one Philippa Gregory book to begin a rewarding journey of becoming a fan. She writes about this time period as an expert. She knows it so well you become engrossed in the story. Mary Boleyn's story comes to life in these pages. This is historical fiction at its finest. And the best part is that there are more books to enjoy after this one!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is divine. You will not want it to end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a delightful and entertaining historical romance, that explores the life of Mary Boleyn as well as her more famous sister, Anne. It does not seem like Philippa Gregory did extensive research, as the book was rather short on description of life in the Tudor era. But the characters and their relationships were interesting, and kept me turning the pages until the end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For starters I am legally blind, so if I read for to long I get aweful head aches. But while was on a trip I saw this book ,and the cover attracted me to it. I read the jacket, and had to buy it. I really could not put it down. When I finished last night I wished the story would have continued. Have since bought \\"The Queens Fool\\" and \\"The Virgins Lover\\" I hope they are as good. I have not been so into a book since \\" Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" by Gregory Maguire"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"i loved this book!!! it was hard to put down. the authors insight of the life at court was facinating. its hard to believe people actually lived this way. i would highly recommend this book. the story was extremally interesting as well as the historical insight. i will be looking for other books by this author to read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's quick paced and features characters and people that have been a source of interest over four hundred years. However, after reading the book and following it up with nonfictional accounts of Mary and Anne, the truth is Mary was no puritan. She supposedly was quite free with herself in France and only had one child with Henry. But since this is fiction, it was a great read and one must take historical fiction with a healthy grain of salt. The nonfiction accounts are just as riveting as the fictional accounts and I recommend readers follow up with Carrolly Erickson's biography of Anne. Anne also was no saint and had quite a temper."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a very entertaining read. While it's mostly about the Boleyn sisters' efforts to bed and wed King Henry, you can feel good about reading it because it is relatively accurate from an historical perspective."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This well-known author of historical fiction has outdone herself with this rich and absorbing tale of the notorious Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary. The Tudor court, with all its pomp and intrigue, is seen through the eyes of the beautiful Mary Boleyn, who at the age of fourteen arrives at court and becomes lady-in-waiting to Katherine of Aragon, Queen of England and wife to King Henry VIII. Although already married to courtier William Carey, Mary captures the heart of King Henry VIII, whose roving eyes land on this innocent young miss.In the eyes of the grasping and greedy Boleyn family, Mary is but the fatted calf through whom their ambitions, they believe, will become realized. So, they offer her up as a sacrifice to their ruthless ambition. Forced to separate from her husband in order to become the King's mistress, Mary betrays the Queen and becomes mistress to the King, all at the behest of her family. Every step of her affair is choreographed from the wings by her family, with the adept aid of her sly and clever sister, Anne, in the role of chief manipulator.Mary struggles with her own code of honor and personal morality, which is often in conflict with what is mandated by her family. Still, despite her best intentions, Mary disappoints them, as her nature is not the kind that takes well to intrigue and manipulation, as she has sincere feelings of affection for the King, as well as for the Queen. After bearing the King two children, however, she is set aside by a formidable rival, her own sister, Anne, in whom the Boleyn family now place their hopes and ambitions.This is, first and foremost, the story of Mary Boleyn, a woman who has generally been reduced to a footnote in history. It is notable, however, that she was the only Boleyn sibling to survive the purges of the Tudor court and who, ultimately, married for love in an age when this was not the norm among those of her class. It is also the story of Anne Boleyn, her rise and fall, as seen through the eyes of her sister, Mary, with whom Anne was to have a lifelong rivalry.To a lesser degree, it is also the story of their brother, George, a more remote, though no less interesting, personage. His interjection into the story is necessary, as the author attempts to address the issue of incest that arose at the trial of George and Anne Boleyn. She gives quite an interesting perspective on the issue, weaving it, part and parcel, into the story in an effort to explain his downfall, as well his betrayal by his own wife.Told against the magnificent backdrop of the Tudor Court in all its splendor and majesty, the author weaves a complex tale of greed, ambition, sex, and political machination, as well as unparalleled intrigue, in sixteenth century England. Filled with well-fleshed characters taken right out of the annals of history, the story is one that is sure to delight all those with a love for well-written historical fiction. In particular, fans of beloved author, Jean Plaidy, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an excellent story for fans of the Elizabethan Era. It gives the story of Anne Boleyn's rise to power and explains how Mary Boleyn is comanded to become the King's mistress at the pushing of her very amibitious Howard family and watches as her own sister steals away her lover and the father of her children. It gives a very human view to a story about two sisters, one considered a mistress to the King of England and the other the girl who insisted upon marriage before allowing the King in her bed and ends up dying on a scaffold with all of England declaring her a witch. It is a very easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was ok. A good read if you are looking to fill up time, but not somewhere you want to go looking for valid historical information. However, once again Anne is portrayed as a spoiled gold/power-digger, as usual. I wish someone would say something nice about her!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book has entranced me over and over. Even though I must have read it a hundred times by now, it never fails to wrap me up into it's world. As far as it's historical value, the Author admits that most of it is pure make believe, based on a loose timeline of obscure facts. Nevertheless, the book made me believe in Mary Boleyn and her struggle to be the famous Boleyn girl, and her pleasure in finding that the &quot;Other Boleyn Girl&quot; is just what she wanted to be all along. Read this book, you'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a wonderful story about the power of siblings and what status and favor can do to a family. The Boleyn family is brought to the kings court when they are children. The three siblings, Mary, Anne and Gregory, grow up around the king's court while their uncle plots for the family to move up in favor.Mary, the story's narrator, is chosen by the family to become the king's lover at barely 14 and produces a son and daughter for him even though she is already married to one of his courtiers. It is then decided that it is to be Anne that takes her place as the king's lover and the family's hope is for her to become queen in place of Katherine of Aragon.Through lies and plotting Anne eventually marries Henry and strives to give him the son he always wanted. When after a few attempts, she fails to do so, she and Gregory commit the ultimate sin so the family stays in favor even though he is in love with another man. As history will tell, Anne is eventually executed and Henry marries four more women before his death.The story is extremely engaging and the book kept my attention throughout. I was sorry for the story to end. I would definately recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have previously written a review on this book and have decided to include more information. This book was wonderful. It really made you think about how cruelly women were used in the past. Mary was treated like an animal, a person without feelings, like an object. She was used as something to further her family's importance. The king's mistress at 13! And Mary really had no one's shoulder to cry on. Her sister Anne was jealous of her, her brother was nice but would have told their father or uncle. I was happy at the end where she married someone she loved, I was angry when her sister banished her from court, I felt happy when Anne finally got what she deserved. Mary didn't want much. All she wanted was to be with her children and husband..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its purely entertainment value. I agree with the other reviewers that this book contains some glaringly inaccurate historical details, but if you are looking for true historical fact, then reading historical fiction is probably not the route you should pursue. I do not know for sure if the inaccuracies were intentional or not, but my feeling is (from the author interview at the end of the book) that the author attempted to write this story as accurately as possible. Unfortunately, that attempt was not successful.I do have some reservations about the characterization that Anne Bolyen received. The author appears to have used all the ugly and malicious rumours that swirled around Anne during her &quot;show&quot; trial as a basis for her character. While it is true that Anne was a strong, ambitious and tempetous woman, I feel her treatment in this book almost makes her look insanely self-centered and power-seeking. BUT! This does make for an fun read!All together, the story is entertaining and well written. You are able to get a true feel for court life and the machinations behind the throne. The characters are well defined and the plot line is clean.I recommend this book - just don't get distracted by the inaccuracies. This is fiction and fun fiction at that."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. Easy to get into the characters and stay involved -- the heroine is wonderful and I believe true to the period but modern enough for modern women to sympathize with."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have always loved Tuder England and this book was a wonderful surprise. It has always been obvious that there was more to Anne Boleyn than met the eye and this fictional account seen through the eyes of her younger sister, Mary, was imaginative and provacative. Ms. Gregory has a splendid way of taking the rumors of Henry VIII's court and breathing life into them. However, it is obvious that the Boleyn siblings were pawns in their families' desire for power. It was a fast, easy and enjoyable book to read and I was sorry to have it end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As a fan of Tudor England and of Anne Boleyn in particular, I was very interested and excited to read this book. I was not disappointed. It was a wonderful and seamless blend of fact and fiction. Although, I don't necessary agree with the thesis that Anne was guilty of the crimes she was executed for, the book was so well written and intriguing that that made no difference. I was sucked in. I stayed up two nights in a row until 3 am reading (and I had to get up around 7 the next day) because it was so engrossing. Everyone I made read the book loved it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this book down! What a wonderful way to learn history...what a wonderful story. A enthrawling story of the Boleyn family (queen Elizabeth was born to Anne Boleyn) and their struggles and triumphs in the King's court. A must for anyone that likes a good love story, or an excellent historical (fact and fiction) account of King Henry."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time!I put my life on hold so that I could finish it. I've discovered a great author and plan to read all the other books she's written. I was never interested in reading English historical novels, but now I'm hooked! Do not pass this book up!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read; I could not put it down. It has opened a whole new area of interest for me. It always had me wondering what would happen next and I never for a moment lost interest."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The first thing you need to know about this book is that it is a work of fiction! If you want to read a biography of members of English monarchy, then strolling through the fiction shelf is a bad idea. A lot of people are casting doubts on the accuracy of events in this book. It's not meant to be accurate, it is fiction. A lot of people had the same reaction to The Da Vinci Code, another brilliant book. That was not meant to be an accurate account of the Catholic Church and this particular book is not meant to be one of the Boleyns. To accuse \\"historical fiction\\" of inaccuracy is such an obvious oxymoron that well, strange that people do it!The plot: It is absolutely brilliant; starts and ends on the gravest notes possible. We begin our journey through 16th century England right at the execution block and end it there. The story is woven to delight any reader and it is the kind of plot which makes you reach out for the book every time you put it down.The characters: I must say, I have been utterly blown away by the character development. Who cares if the original people involved were any different, if Anne was any less of a plotter than she is portrayed to be in this book? The characters stick with you and your first instinct upon ending the book is to go online and look for The Boleyn Inheritance to see what became of the survivors.Writing style: The writing style is, if anything, immaculately compatible with historical fiction. I have to say this book defines the genre and as you can probably see, it has over 800 reviews with a stunning average. The writing has stayed in my head while I was reading the book and I literally had to force myself to put it down before going to bed.All in all, this book was an absolute pleasure to read and for those of you wondering whether you should take the plunge into historical fiction, it's the ideal platform to start."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I devoured this book in two days. The author's writing style compels you to keep turning pages...you have to find out what (usually awful) It is kind of like seeing roadkill, you want to look away, but you just have to find out what the heck that thing was... I found the book to be somewhat disturbing in several parts. When I got done, I felt satisfaction at being finished with it, but unable to really recommend it to anyone in that it really was depressing to follow all the characters through bad choices and the farce of their lives. I think the author is a very talented writer - but I didn't care for the storyline."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The story of Henry the VIII is so convoluted that it can be hard to believe it actually happened. Based on historical facts, with the dramatic flair and touches of a true fiction novel, Gregory does a wonderful job bringing everyone back to life and depicting the relationships and situations that made Tudor England so memorable."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I never had much interest in historical fiction, the Boleyns, or royalty for that matter, until I read The Other Boleyn Girl. I was engrossed from the beginning. Philippa Gregory made me feel like the third Boleyn sister living at court with them. I liked that some of her prose were 21st century because it added spice to the book. It may not be historically accurate, but who cares? This is fiction, afterall. There are plenty of history books out there if you want to read accurate accounts. Overall, this book was hefty and satisfying!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am an avid reader of literature so I wasn't quite sure what I would think of this novel. I thought that perhaps it would be a throw away beach-type read with no other redeeming qualities other than to pass a blistery summer afternoon. I was mistaken. I absolutely love this book. I could not put it down. All my waking hours were spent reading this novel much to the chagrin of my 4 year old son. The story is very intriguing, it has a lot of forward momentum and if you are a fan of historical fiction, such as myself, do not pass this up. As I approached the end, I felt sadness coming on because I knew it would soon be over. It's a fun read, but one that will not insult your intelligence."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I got addicted to reading it and would stay up so late at night. It has AMAZing characters, plot and twists, and the writing is incredible. My favorite part of this book is the story is not wholly non fiction, and it makes these historical characters come alive."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book got me started on the Tudor family. I first read it because Scarlett Johansen and Natalie Portman were in the movie and I love them. I read the book before I saw the movie and I liked the book even more than the movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie was great but in my opinion it ignores the best parts then totally makes up it's own ending. The book was so much more juicier with scandal. You are horrified with how manipulative Anne Boleyn was and how she harshly she treated ger sister Mary. Anne would do anything to be Queen which is what got her killed. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Very long, but I finished it in a day because it was so enthralling. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Many disgruntled reviewers are disappointed in the accuracy of the book. I will remind them that this is historical FICTION. The book is not intended as a biographical piece. I am on my second read as this is not a new book and enjoying it very much. Don't get caught up in the inaccuracies just enjoy it for what it was meant to be....historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I think that Philippa Gregory is a wonderful writer! She pulls you into the lives of the people in her books. After reading one of her books I ran out and bought 4 more of hers. Each one that I read; I kept finding myself unable to put them down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the first time I have ever read a historical fiction, and I don't know why it took me so long. I couldn't put this book down. I usually read suspense and this had suspense and much, much more. It is probably the best book I have read in about 5 years. Definately a change of pace. It is a long book, but before you know it, you will be reading the last page. I definately recommend it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Thought I have never read much historical fiction, I found this book to be absolutley engrossing. I find myself absolutley fascinated by the scandalous monarchy in a way I never knew. I finished this book within days of picking it up - it's a good read, through and through."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is a fascinating tale of the role that Anne Boleyn played in Henry VIII's court, but that's not until at least halfway through. First, the reader is taken on an emotional and captivating journey through the life of Anne's younger sister Mary, who, at age 14, is taken away from her husband to serve as the king's mistress.Mary is clearly in love with the king and enjoys the fact that she has temporarily won a round in the sisterly war against the older Anne. Their brother George, who has issues of his own, is a key player in controlling the Howard family's involvement in and control over the throne of England.Told from Mary's point of view, we finally see through King Henry as a womanizer, and Anne as a political player to the death. None of the characters however, is predictable at all. Mary grows wise with her age; George vacillates back and forth between brother, lover, and politician; Anne feigns love for her family and her king, only to later commit shocking atrocities in the name of power.Katherine of Aragon becomes a beloved but pitied figure in Mary's eyes, and a pawn in the wicked game the Howards play. The reality of her position on the throne is revealed quite deftly by this talented author.Although the historical account of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and the fight for the throne of England are familiar to almost everyone, the reader will find many complexities in the characters and the unpredictable plot that make the story riveting right to the very end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Being a junkie who loves to read about British nobility, I have found some books on the subject to be big yawners, much like college text books, but not this one. Philippa Gregory has a wonderful perception of the lives of her characters, which is evident in her writings. They have become more alive for me than with any other author.I would highly recommend this book and am looking forward to reading the others she has written."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a really good book, the first couple pages were a little hard to read but then you get the hang of it. You also have to look up some people because there's so many Thomas', Henry's, Elizabeth's, etc. But I couldn't put the book down after I started reading it and I took the book everywhere with me. And I've bought all the other books Phillipa Gregory wrote about that time period. They are also making a movie based on the book which comes out in 2007 I think and Scarlett Johanson is Mary Boleyn and Natalie Portman is Anne."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Without a doubt, Philippa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is entertaining. Gregory chose as her narrator Mary Boleyn--the \\"other\\" Boleyn woman that was part of the Henry VIII harem. Gregory focuses on the rivalry between sisters Mary and her more infamous (and unlucky) sister Anne, playing on traditional archetypes in fairly obvious ways: while Mary is presented as fair, conventionally pretty, not especially bright, and all English, Anne is dark, intelligent, ambitious, \\"French\\" (with all the negative associations that are attached), and self-centered. Yet it is these flaws that make both characters compelling, and readers have to pity the lack of freedom and individual agency the women have as pawns of the powerful men in their lives. While the book is not historically accurate, the miscues and factual errors aren't glaring enough to disturb the flow of the novel, and Gregory should be commended for nailing the sycophantic and cutthroat atmosphere that prevailed in the Tudor court. This is a quick, fun read--one I would recommend to those who like historical fiction and who want to curl up with a good book on a cold, rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a great book. I am not an avid reader. I had a long plane ride ahead and picked it up in the airport. It takes a lot to hold my attention and this book did just that. I didn't want to put it down. Yes, it is a bit long but with something happening constantly it goes by very fast."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book!!!! I could not put it down. I cannot wait to get my hands on more of MS. Gregory's work. I loved how the book was sset in the time of Henry the VIII, but they spoke in modern language, so it was easily understood. And, to top it all off, I even learned a few things from the book.A must read!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. It was an absolute page turner. The book was perfectly broken up into short increments. The best of this historical fiction novel, is that my favorite part is true (Mary and her lover's relationship)! I have read Doomed Queen Anne by Carolyn Meyer (highly recommended along with all the Young Royals Series) and this book was a welcome addition to my fascination with Anne Boleyn. The relationships between Mary, Anne, and their bother George was riveting. The rivalry between the Boleyns and the Seymours was fun to read and experience. This book was fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone who loves historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a MUST READ for anyone in love with passion and scandal, romance and the Elizabethan / Tudor England time period. Quite frankly, the best historical fiction book I've read in the past two years. Happy reading~"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Judging from other reviews, this book seems to fall into either the \\"love it or hate it\\" category. As an ardent Anne fan I was naturally disappointed in it but I can understand why others were not. It is a good plot read and gives a new spin on what is ultimately the story of Anne rather than Mary Boleyn. However, I also noted a lot of historical mistakes - the least of which was a complete omission of Mary's scandalous past in France - and the writing style was just left of bad romance novel. I recommend a much earlier Anne book called \\"Brief Gaudy Hour\\" by Margaret Campbell Barnes."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I understand the need for a historical novel to be entertaining, to be liberal in the interpretation of historical facts and to invent when the records themselves are lacking.That said, I often wonder why writers (and film makers) feel that they must attempt to re-write history in order to have an exciting product. To begin with, most Tudor historians agree that Mary was the older sister of Anne, with a birth date of approximately 1499. She was also not the blushing bride of the novel, as information appears to point to her being the mistress of Francis I while she spent time in France in service to Henry's sister Mary. So much for the 12 year old virgin.Our own knowledge of Mary Boleyn is not that extensive; irregardless, the storyline itself is quite interesting and keeps one turning the pages. But it is important to keep in mind that what one is reading here is fiction with very little basis in fact.I'm not sure what credentials Ms. Gregory has as a historian, but almost right off the bat she indicates that much \\"wine and water\\" was drunk at a royal feast. In Tudor England no one drank the water; it was extremely unhealthy to the point of transmitting fatal diseases. Mostly \\"light\\" or \\"short\\" beer was the beverage of men, women and children due to this fact. To her credit, the author then seems to have come round and has everyone drinking the proper brews, but that one slip up was a harbinger of things to come.A positive side of this novel is the way Ms. Gregory teaches us how ambitious and vicious the court of a monarch was. Aristocratic families jockeyed for power, watching, waiting and trying to win even the slightest favor from the king. Women were, as she illustrates, useful only as pawns in gaining more prominence and power for the family involved. And unfortunately, it was also not unusual for a woman to be cast aside once she had fulfilled (or failed) to advance the family's fortune.What I can't understand, however, is why Ms. Gregory felt that she had to demonize Anne and George Boleyn to the extent that she did. We know from contemporary writings (both pro and con) that Anne was a high-strung, nervous and sensitive woman given to bouts of hysteria and often works of cruelty. In that sense, she departed from the ideal court lady, and she ended up paying a heavy price for it. But she was also well-educated, holding opinions about religion and politics that was unusual for someone of her gender and station. None of this comes out in the book.Anne is made so vicious, I suppose, in order for Mary to appear as the soft-spoken woman she probably was. But I doubt very much that the sisters' relationship was filled with so much vitriol and lack of feeling on Anne's part as this book portrays. It would not have hurt to have given the relationship between Mary and Anne a bit more sensitivity and understanding.The one who suffers the most in this novel is George Boleyn. There is absolutely no evidence that he was in love with, and had intimate relations, with Anne. This was typical slander and an accusation so bizarre that at his trial it caused much mumbling and anger in the spectators, so much so that some were betting that he would be acquitted. Unfortunately, we know this was not to be the case.All in all, if you want to read an interesting novel set in the court of Henry VIII, then this book will satisfy that need. Just remember that most of it is conjecture and goes out of its way to make Mary Boleyn appear as an angel while Anne is the Wicked Witch of the West--or at least of Hever Castle.P.S. Publishers need to assure that their books are proof read not only for spelling, but also for grammar. This work is replete with commas all over the place, mostly where they do not belong and make no sense. Perhaps this is just the sad result of a dumbing down of the English language in our modern era of \\"internet speak\\" and texting messages."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this down. I don't waste my time with nonnsense. This book is packed with informationa revolving around King Henry's Court. And it was so entertaining I was sorry it ended. I went right out and bought \\"The Queen's Fool\\" because I wanted the saga to continue. This book is so well written and researched and entertaining you don't realize you're getting an education. All the facts you ever wanted to know about the difficulies of daily life in the era as a backdrop to the intrique as 2 sister's vie for the affections of the King while he is still married to Kathrine of Aragon. All done as a political move by their family with the girls being used as pawns. I had never really understood the \\"Inquistion\\" but that was a backdrop to the story as well and I now understand what motivated it as well as the start of the Church of England. Historically accurate & delightfully entertaining. A Masterpiece.

As a lover of historical novels, I was curious on how the author would portray the famous Anne Boleyn. To my disappointment, she was one-dimensional and flat - like all the other characters in this book.I understand that there are historical inaccuracies or distortions in such a book in order to make the plot flow or more interesting to readers. Fine, I accept them because this is a historical FICTION, not a history textbook.However, to make the characters in the story either vicious and evil or virtuous and kind, made the plot tiring to read and to accept. Anne Boleyn is portrayed as a selfish and manipulative woman, at times so psychotically unhinged and unreasonable that I found her character to be laughable. On the other hand, we have her sister Mary Boleyn - that poor, innocent girl used by her scheming relatives to attain wealth and status. The author wants readers to love her, to sympathize with her - but I am sorry to say that I could not. She narrates this entire story from the age of 13 to her twenties and sadly, her character's voice does not mature or grow up. She was still the naive and wanton teenager at the age of twenty, with just the addition of various proclamations of love to her kids. Also, I found her thought process fragmented and just plain weird because at one point, she hates her sister to the extent where she wishes her death and then at the next moment, she's all best friends with her. I mean, what? Other characters are also this poorly constructed and unbelievable - from the almost saintly Queen Katherine to the lurker-like, nosy-to-the-point-of-wanting-to-harm-her-own-husband's reputation Jane Parker.The prose and style this book is written in is also not particularly special. Rather, her sentences are very simply constructed and at times, repetitive. I felt no emotional response at any point while reading this book because how can one feel anything when the author merely uses a sentence to describe the death of so-and-so. She 'tells' us too many things rather than showing us. Without the sexual themes, this book could be easily read by a middle school student.I can not understand why people are giving such high ratings for this book. To me, it was like reading one of those romance novels you can get at the convenience store. All I wanted to do was to chuck it out the window in between readings. This novel lacks well-developed characters (at times, I felt offended at the portrayal) and the prose is not particularly beautiful or inspiring. I suggest borrowing it from the library if you really want to read it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory does admittedly have a wonderful writing style, which is what first attracted me to the book. The topic: Queen Elizabeth's mother. As I'm an avid reader of anything relating to Queen Elizabeht, I thought this book was a perfect find. Alas, the enchanting writing style of the first few pages falls flat when the historical inaccuracies can no longer be ignored. If you don't care what really happened FINE, but remember that this book and all the events are NOT what happened. If you enjoy historical novel at all, this book is not for you!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl / 0-7432-2744-1They say that history is written by the victor, and thus do we have two very separate histories for the engaging character of Anne Boleyn. The first history, written immediately after she was cast from power, is that of a cruel, commanding, incestuous witch. The second history, written after the ascent of her powerful daughter Elizabeth, is that of a pious, kind, faithful wife. The truth is most likely located somewhere between these two caricatures, but it's important to note that \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is much less interested in finding historical \\"truth\\" and much more interested in telling a compelling story.Make no mistake: this is not history. For the sake of her story, Gregory has taken several major \\"what if?\\" questions and has run wildly with them. For instance: What if Anne was an evil and conniving contrast to her sweet and innocent sister Mary? What if Mary's affair with the king had been one of deep love and tenderness, only to be shoved aside when Anne deliberately and cruelly supplanted her? What if Mary's disappointing marriage to a displaced noble was not one of disgrace, but rather a marriage of true love and happiness, in marked contrast to Anne's famously ill-fated marriage? These assumptions are not good history, but they do make for an interesting framing device.The characters here may be inaccurate, but they are compelling. Henry comes closest to accuracy, with his mercurial moods and petty childishness. We are lead to understand that Henry is a bad monarch because he lacks the self-awareness to realize that the flattery laid upon him by his courtiers are not the truth. Mary is the madonna of the story: sweet, innocent, desirable, spiritually virginal, and with such a bad head for politics that even her lover calls her a 'sweet idiot'. Her incompetence with politics feels largely like a plot device so that matters can be carefully explained to the reader, but the device isn't too awkward. Anne contrasts as the whore of the story; cruel, conniving, vicious, tempestuous, and also surprisingly stupid, despite her ability to lead Henry by the nose for the first part of the novel. It doesn't make sense that she can be fantastically charming prior to marriage and yet descend quickly into a withering shrew afterward, considering the stake she has in keeping her husband happy, but we are lead to believe that the distracted Anne is descending quietly into madness.The story moves at an enjoyable clip, and the tale of one sister waiting patiently in the wings while another grabs all the glory to her eventual ruin is an old motif but still plays out well here. We worry for Mary; will she find happiness, will she find love, will she escape her family? We fret for Anne, because as hateful as she is here, we hate Henry all the more. While I would have preferred a more historically accurate novel, I still enjoyed this one - you may too, as long as you remember that this is bad history in order to make a good story.

I am familiar with the story of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, and was looking forward to a masterful retelling by a reknown author. A friend had read it and raved about it. Amazon readers are raving about it. I wish I could rave about it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this retelling for several reasons. Firstly, I found the writing style simplistic and unauthentic. Sometimes it seemed that the characters were speaking in 21st century phrasing. I found the characters themselves to be unrealistic and underdeveloped. There was no depth to any of them, such that I really didn't care what happened to any of them. Anne was a grasping, hysterical, diabolical, selfish user. George appeared to be no better than a hanging-on go-for, interminably lolling around in his sisters' bedchamber. Henry himself comes off as an easily manipulated, not very smart, spoiled brat. He demonstrates no kingly qualities and is usually either whining to Mary about his lack of an heir, raging at Katherine, or following Anne around like a love-sick, helpless puppy. Mary, the main character is made out to be a sweet, generous, unwilling pawn of her evil family. Although she was pushed into her affair with Henry, she really wanted nothing more than the simple life of a country matron surrounded by her beautiful children. She seemed to be completely in love with Henry at one moment, and then totally emotionally indifferent to him the next. Her relationship to her first husband, William, is nonexistent one minute, and loving and devoted the next. I found it amusing that she could claim complete devotion to Queen Katherine, continue to betray her time and again, and then come sniveling back professing her great love and respect. The only character which I did feel a sympathy for and was protrayed with sensitivity and grace was the character of Katherine. Other major characters in the drama were relegated to minor incidental roles, such as the powerful, brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, the sinister mastermind Thomas Cromwell, and the courageous, honorable Thomas More. They all became background props for the silly one-dimensional story of Mary Boleyn. The momentous event of Henry's declaring himself head of the English church, and the devastating power struggle that surrounded it is dismissed in one sentence. On comparing this story to Antionia Fraser's excellent \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", one learns that 1) Mary was actually the elder of the two sisters, 2) Mary had led quite a sexually promiscuous life in France before returning to England, even having had an affair with King Francis 3) Henry never acknowledged Mary's son as his.At the end of the book (which I really only skimmed because by this time I couldn't stand it anymore) Mary manages to predictably retire to the country with her lovely family and new husband, whom she's conveniently madly in love with, and live happily ever after while the rest of her family goes down in flames. Oh well, I guess such high virtue as Mary's provides its own reward."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am a historical fiction fan who has read countless books about the tyrannical reign of Henry VIII and his collection of wives. I have always found the love affair between Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII to be particularly fascinating and have read and reread the story from the point of view of several of the characters including the self-serving Anne Boleyn and the &quot;woe is me&quot; Henry VIII. Philippa Gregory has certainly added an interesting perspective by writing this story from the heart and mind of Anne's all too often forgotten sister Mary Boleyn. In &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, Mary is portrayed as the heroine who is mercilessly forced by her power hungry family to become Henry's lover, and not the blithering buxom empty shell that she is typically portrayed as. Mary Boleyn is a woman with the morals and the courage to stand beside those that she loves. Without a doubt, &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; was a great read that kept me up at night turning the pages of a story that normally I could recite by heart, however written in such a new and refreshing manner that I could not help but hope that the final outcome somehow, someway, might be different this time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As both a student and teacher of history, I approached this novel with more than a little trepidation. Historical fiction is frequently a genre that takes such liberties with the history that all that is left is the fiction. The film \\"Elizabeth\\" is a case in point, where Mary Queen of Scots finds her death being depicted not as a trial and eventual execution in February 1587, but rather as a bedroom dalliance with Australian actor Geoffrey Rush. Dramatic licence is one thing, but to so distort the historical events to such a degree is too distressing, especially when many of my students having seen the film accepted this version of events as real.Philippa Gregory has done a fine job with this novel, however, by steering clear of any sensational tracks, but rather maintaining a steady and reasonable course throughout.Based around the unfortunately sketchy character of Anne Boleyn's sister Mary, the titular \\"other Boleyn girl\\", this is a novel that captures well the flavour of the intrigues and personal ambitions of those at the court of Henry VIII. Mary, the pawn in her family's quest for rank and privilege, is promoted ruthlessly to capture Henry's eye and in time becomes his mistress. Mary bore Henry two children, a boy and a girl, before his interest waned and the Howard family instead promoted Mary's sister Anne into Henry's bed. A demoted Mary is then coerced into aiding her sister's cause at Court, all the while becoming more and more disillusioned with palace life and wanting instead to forge her own future with her children in the country.The story keeps fairly well to the major historical events between 1521 and 1536, and the portrayal of Henry is done well, reflecting the physical and intellectual vigour of his youth, and his decline into the bloated monster he became.A quibble is the portrayal of Anne as a calculating harpy throughout the book. One senses that Gregory wants us to suddenly feel a measure of sympathy for her as she meets her fate in the Tower. This is impossible, and as a reader one can only feel what Henry did at the time of her execution, and say \\"good riddance\\".Over-all this is a very fine piece of historical fiction that expands on an interesting footnote in English history.Incidentally, in a recent customer survey by New Zealand's largest bookshop chain (where I worked for five years), this novel was voted 38th favourite book of the last year."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm still not to sure what possessed me to read this. Sure a bunch of people I knew said it was great. Now I'm seriously questioning their sanity. For some reason I kept reading, as I hoped it would get better. 600+ pages later, I've realized that I'm never going to get that time back. The author manages to reduce the Tudor Era into a cheesy soap opera. Seriously, one could have just replaced the names with modern day ones, and set the story in some inner city, and made it about drug dealers and prostitutes, and it would have more or less read the same.First off, the main character. Besides Bella in Twilight, I'd find it difficult to find a more bland and boring main character. Her sum goal in life seems to be, I want to marry for love! and have lots of bouncing babies! The author glorifies this, by contrasting her to her nymphomaniac of a sister, Anne, who's depicted as cruel and comes off as an insane harpy. Now, the author considers her self a feminist, yet she portrays the active woman as a monster, and the \\"good\\" woman, as passive and bland. Oh, and if its not subtle enough, Anne has dark hair, and dark features, while the good sister, has blond hair and pale features. Coincidence? I think not.Now, on to the history of this book. For some reason the author decided that all allegations made against Anne were true. This is the historical equivalent of saying that all the allegations made during the communist show trials of the 50's were true. The author takes this to the extreme, and in her book, Anne sleeps with her own brother in an attempt to get pregnant. At the end, the whole thing just comes off as offensive.The writing is pretty bad also. The heavy use of foreshadowing doesn't help the situation. I'm pretty sure people already know what happened to Anne, so they aren't going to be saying when they reach the end of the book \\"Darn...I should have seen that coming!\\"In short, save your money, save your time and read some good historical fiction. Like Susanne Alleyn's A Game of Patience, or The Caviler of the Apocalypse."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you're looking for well developed characters, thoughtful dialogue, or intellectual stimulation, don't pick up this book. The Tudor period is fascinating and offers all you need for a gripping plot. The story itself is quite intriguing when written about by others. Despite hearing rave reviews, I found Philippa Gregory's prose to be poorly constructed and incredibly irritating. I wasn't bothered by the historical inaccuracies; after all, it is a \\"novel\\" and many of the facts are debatable.If you want a long read on par with a Harlequin Romance (actually, those are better), then this would be a perfect fit. I would have given \\"0\\" stars if I could have."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I will start by saying that the book is entertaining.....if you care nothing about historical accuracy, you'll probably really enjoy it! Gregory took what is an incredibly interesting topic and turned it into a sleazy, tabloid read. Gregory just twisted or omitted facts to suit her novel and that really annoyed me. It is widely recognized that Mary is older than Anne. There is no proof that either of Mary's children are Henry VIII's. When Anne banished Mary from court, Mary never returned, but in the book, she is summoned back and witnesses Anne's downfall. Completely inacurate. I found it appalling that in the book, Mary even sends Anne a letter while she is in the Tower. I've read many Tudor experts say that Mary never contacted either George or Anne at all after they were taken to the Tower, and Mary's daughter Catherine most certainly was not there. Also, it is commonly accepted that King Henry declared Anne the care of Henry Carey after his father died, there is no evidence to support that Anne demanded him and \\"stole\\" him from Mary. The author just adds in these ridiculous tidbits to continually portray Anne as some crazy, horrible shrew. Gregory put several known lies about Anne in the book. There is also no historical evidence that Anne gave birth to a \\"deformed monster\\", nor that it was fathered by her brother George. I felt this was a cheap way to \\"dirty\\" up the novel to make it more interesting. Upon her own execution later, Jane Parker admitted she lied about George and Anne Boleyn's alleged incestuous affair. So I don't think Gregory had any reason to insinuate that it actually happened other than to make her novel juicier. I can't respect that at all. I concede not much is known about Mary Boleyn, so it must have been challenging to create a whole book from her perspective, I just wish Gregory had respected the widely accepted facts from the era and not basically made her own cheapened version of history. What saddens me is that a lot of people who don't know much about the Tudor era will accept much of this novel as fact when it is not."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Because Gregory's other books tend to be of the romantic genre I haven't read her before. This one was recommended to me, and I am glad to have read it. From start to finish I was entranced by the story. She is an excellent writer and knows how to move the plot along quite seamlessly so that 600+ pages seemed like nothing.However, call me old fashioned, but I do like some historical accuracy with my historical fiction. While I enjoyed her ideas and theories about character motivations, I do think she was a bit heavy handed. While Anne certainly was not the innocent victim as she has been protrayed elsewhere, she certainly was not the evil witch in the book. And the author seems to absolve King Henry from all blame in the things that she supposedly did alone. As far as Mary, its well to remember that little is really known about her, aside from the fact that she did have at least one child by Henry. I did like how she made Katharine of Aragon a much more complex and interesting persxon. But then, I question her portrayal of the Howards as totally cold, calculating and vicious. There are always at least three sides to every story, and its good to remember that this is one of them.That being said - if you like good writing, can gloss over the historical inaccuracies, can accept a young narrator who seems to have unusually 21st century sensibilities for her time period, and remember that this is fiction, I'd recommend this book. Excellent summer read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As a history buff and huge fan of Anne Boleyn, this novel made me sick. There is a limit as to how far a novelist can stretch the truth while writing historical fiction, and Gregory went too far. It is clear that Gregory did hardly any research on Anne Boleyn's character (as is evidence by the fact that she did not even consult THE biography on Anne, Eric Ives's book) and instead was too concerned with making Mary Boleyn out to be more important than she actually was to English history. Gregory unfortunately just reiterated the slanders that Anne Boleyn's character incurred after her execution by her Catholic enemies. It is sad that an author today could do so much disrespect to a historical figure in one novel. Furthermore, she cites Retha Warnicke's research as being her primary basis for the novel, yet after Warnicke heard this, she publicly distanced herself from the novel--mainly because Gregory misinterpreted Warnicke's theories completely. In my opinion, Gregory may as well have made up characters and kept the story she wrote, because she completely changes the personalities of these figures as we know them from the years of reasearch done by actual historians. I am all for using creative license to \\"fill in the gaps\\", but Gregory uses far too much license in this book, and instead changes the facts for her own interest--in order to make Anne appear as the horrible, manipulative sister, while Mary is an innocent victim of Anne's wrath. It is proposterous. For example, Gregory completely ignores Mary's behavior in France before she joined the Tudor court. Historians are pretty certain that she slept with the King of France, as well as others, during her time there. Gregory chooses to believe that Mary is a virgin when she comes to Henry, just to make her appear more innocent. Another example is Anne making Henry Carey her ward. She did this because Mary did not have enough money to give Henry a proper education, so Anne was helping her, and actually did an extremely nice thing by giving him such a good education. Gregory spins this to make it seem like Anne is stealing Henry from Mary--a ridiculous notion and quite the opposite of what actually happened.Besides the switching around of facts, the book isn't even very well written. The characters are very black and white, as is true in most of Gregory's novels (one woman=good, other woman=bad). I would not recommend this book to anyone.. if I could give it a 0 star review, I would have."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Historical fiction is a favourite guilty pleasure of mine, and I came to this book with no pre-conceptions; in fact, I actually expected to like it. Unfortunately, and many reviewers have said it more eloquently than I, TOBG is poorly-written, vulgar and offensive on a number of levels. It is reminiscent of self-indulgent internet fanfic, where the only constructive criticism received must have been along the lines of \\"Soooo need more!!1!!!\\" I am still mystified as to how it even got published in its current form.I get that this is historical _fiction_, and that that means an author is free to make up details as he or she sees fit. Of course, one can never expect complete accuracy; I am pretty tolerant of historical errors and literary licence, provided that these are acknowledged and disclosed to the reader. I've enjoyed numerous historical novels, most of which could never be regarded as classic literature or accurate, but which bring to life the era and the personalities vividly. I did not expect the definitive biography of Anne and Mary Boleyn by any stretch of the imagination. What I did expect though was at least an attempt at treating the characters with a modicum of respect and remaining true as far as possible to what we know about them, as well as a gripping and enjoyable story. TOBG provided neither.This author claims to be a \\"feminist historian.\\" However there is nothing \\"feminist\\" about the portrayal of the women here, in fact like a previous reviewer, I think it's bordering on misogynist: Mary and Anne are reduced to one-dimensional representatives of the \\"Madonna/whore\\" stereotype, with Mary being the ultimate Mary Sue, embodiment of all that is pure and virtuous (complete with some 21st century attitudes about marrying for love), and Anne a vicious, megalomaniacal, amoral troll with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Mary's reputation - which comes to us from contemporary accounts - as a good-time girl of the French court is completely whitewashed over; in this universe, she is a sweet, innocent teenager when she becomes Henry VIII's mistress. There's no sign of Anne Boleyn, the cultured, very well-educated, multilingual Renaissance lady and Queen, who produced the great Elizabeth I and during her lifetime, patronised the arts, generously dispensed charity and was deeply interested in religious reform, to name just a few things.This novel does both of these women, as well as the other characters, a disservice with this flat, caricatured portrayal. There is no light and shade, no complexity; in fact, some of the characterisations are completely implausible. The dialogue is frequently anachronistic, the prose is often turgid and heavy-handed - Gregory tells, rather than shows - and I found myself skim-reading a lot of it just to finish it. The language evokes little sense of the period, with characters being attributed with modern attitudes and opinions. It takes some doing, but TOBG manages to turn interesting, dramatic and complex events into a dreary, tedious family soap opera, with a substantial dose of gratuitous and disturbing sleaze.Fiction dealing with people who really existed is tough to write, as I believe there is a responsibility to remain as close to the facts as we know them as possible; one must have very good reason to diverge from the accepted historical record. This means researching the era and the personalities almost as thoroughly as one would a biography. As other reviewers have pointed out, Gregory's research - if the listed bibliography is all that was consulted - appears shoddy at best: she ignores the definitive biography of Anne Boleyn by Eric Ives, for example. Some of the plot elements are so removed from the historical record (let alone basic human psychology) and thus so implausible that it is hard to take the novel seriously. Mary becoming Henry's mistress at 13 - why make her so young? Anne marrying Henry Percy? Being sent to France as \\"punishment\\"? Henry VIII fathering both of Mary Boleyn's children? The Boleyn parents effectively being pimps for their daughters? Anne seducing Henry away from her sister? \\"Stealing\\" or \\"abducting\\" Mary's son to establish him as a \\"potential Tudor-Boleyn heir\\"? George Boleyn sleeping with Francis Weston (this element did nothing to advance the story whatsoever, and seemed to be included for the sake of it) but also happens to be sexually attracted to his sister ... and acts on it? Mark Smeaton being _ Weston_'s musician? Deformed incest babies? The list goes on. Sorry, just no.Again, an author is entitled to take liberties and deviate from the historical record for dramatic purposes, but here, there is no disclosure that this has occurred; in fact, there has been repeated insistence to the contrary. Further, it is difficult to see how the plot and the central themes of the novel would have suffered had some of the above elements been accurate.This would have been a far better novel had it focused on purely imaginary characters, set in Tudor times. The same themes could have been explored just as effectively had the protagonists been say, two fictional noblewomen vying for the attention of the Duke of Whatevershire, and there is no restriction on how the personalities are portrayed or the course of events.I respect the fact that many readers have enjoyed this novel for what it is, but I sincerely hope those whose interest in the period has been sparked by TOBG will go beyond this frankly bizarre alternate universe and sketchy bibliography, and discover the fascinating story of the _real_ Anne Boleyn. Excellent non-fiction sources include Ives' \\"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\\"; and Antonia Fraser and David Starkey's works on the six wives. As for novels about Anne Boleyn - although dated, the best I've found are probably those by Margaret Campbell Barnes (\\"Brief Gaudy Hour\\") and Jean Plaidy (\\"Murder Most Royal\\")."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's hard to understand why Mary Boleyn was relegated to the sidelines of History. The sister of the beheaded Ann Boleyn, the aunt of Queen Elizabeth, and the mother of two of Henry VIII's illegtimate children, including a much coveted son, should rate more interest. But such was the strictness legitimacy laws at the time, that no child who was definitely illegitimate could inherit the throne.Gregory tells the story of Katherine of Aragon, Henry VIII, Ann Boleyn, the formation of the Church of England and intrigueat the Tudor court from the point of view of this salient but much neglected Historical character. Her Mary is really just a child at the beginning of the novel, and she never outgrows valuing love over power. Her value for love and genuine caring for the effect of her behavior on others contrasts sharply with the hypocritical selfishness and merciless intriguing within the all too glittering Tudor court, and more ironically with her family, the grasping and ruthless Boleyns/Howards who pimp out their daughters to the whims of their excruciatingly spoiled and divinely selected monarch. Ironically Mary finds that she must use her abilities as a courtier to defend and hide her own values, not to mention her children, from the court as well as her family. Meanwhile her sister Anne marches inexorably towards historical immortality and personal destruction.Mary is a sympathetic and interesting character, and Gregorydoes a good job of painting the vivid attractions and tragic flaws ofthe Tudor court, including the manipulation of religious law forpersonal gain. At times Mary's ability to outgrow the pettiness of her training and environment seems underexplained, at others one would like to hear more detail about court personalities and customs. Nonetheless The Other Boleyn Girl is well written and an enjoyable reading experience; highly recommended for those who enjoy dabbling in Tudor England."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Having read other books and seen movies about the Tudor period, I found it very interesting to read The Other Boleyn Girl. It was fascinating and horrifying at the same time to realize just how young these girls were and that they were considered goods to be used by the family for its advancement. It was also interesting to see how Henry VIII evolved into the &#34;monster with total power&#34; as these girls were paraded before him and discarded by their family when they were past their &#34;Use By&#34; date. I found the Author's Note ironic but pleasing and am glad Mary's life story was completed. This book was recommended to me by my sister. I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the first book I read from Gregory. I liked it very much, it is definetely a page-turner.It left me wanting to read more about the Boleyns.Despite that, the next book I choose will be from someone who's more accurate in the facts.As so many of you have pointed out, the book has many inaccuracies. I know this is a \\"historical-fiction\\" book and gives the author liberty but I think she took a lot of it.Why did Gregory said Mary was younger than Anne? I don't see why she did not left this as it was.I could keep on with inaccuracies but then again, so many people have already did it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"You just keep on being sweetly stupid, Mary. You do it beautifully.\\"Mary Boleyn is one of Queen Katherine's many ladies-in-waiting. But things change when she catches King Henry VIII's eye. Her family, led by Uncle Thomas Howard, quickly push her into becoming the King's mistress, but Anne, Mary's sister, is never satisfied. Set amidst the turmoil of King Henry's early rule, we follow Mary through her affair with the King, the strife between King Henry and Queen Katherine, and the marriage of King Henry to Queen Anne.The best way I can describe this book is \\"guilty pleasure\\". There is so much to dislike about the book, and yet I was entertained for the entire part. Not to mention, this book made me research Tudor England and the whole drama with King Henry VIII and his many wives, and any book that makes me interested in looking up history or researching the backstory gets a bit of a boost in my book.PLEASE NOTE: I am no historian, nor am I particularly well-versed in this era. Therefore, I am not going to get into much detail about whether or not this book is historically accurate. There are other reviews that go into FAR better detail about whether this is accurate to history; I will defer to them. But I do caution: if you are expecting 100% accuracy, I would encourage you to pass this book up. Just the itsy bitsy bit of research I have done doesn't seem to quite match up to what PG presents here.With that out of the way, let's get on to the good stuff!First off, I really didn't like our \\"protagonist\\", Mary Boleyn. In Gregory's story, Mary Boleyn, the sometimes \\"other Boleyn girl\\" (though the term was applied occasionally to Anne), is the younger sister of Anne (this is one of those areas where historians will tell you that most likely, Mary was the eldest--and in this book, I really felt that Mary acted more like the eldest than the youngest). She is married to William Carrey and quickly attracts the eye of the King. Her family then tells her to seduce him and bed him, which she does. But after the birth of her second child, Anne whisks the King's attention, and Mary is left in the background.I'll admit, I like it when characters aren't perfect, aren't the best or smartest in a field, aren't able to make the right decision each and every time, have actual flaws. But Mary really tries the patience. According to history, Mary was the beauty but not so bright (it was Anne who was the brains), but Mary in TOBG seems unable to put the simplest conclusions together.For instance, when William Stafford leaves to secure a farm for a \\"court lady\\" he's been interested in, Mary IMMEDIATELY assumes he has been seeing someone BESIDES her and snubs him. OF COURSE, we know that William, who knows Mary's desire to be a simple farmer's wife, was actually purchasing the farm for HER. (In Gregory's defense, this Misunderstanding did not last very long.)Another count against Mary is her passivity. I know women in this period do not have the freedoms that modern women do, but Mary was a complete doormat. She rarely even tried to defy her family. Most of her actions are either A) forced upon her or B) reactions to other people's actions. She doesn't initially WANT to seduce the King, but her family forces her. She balks at helping Anne, but her family tells her to. She wants to see her kids, but her family won't let her; therefore, she doesn't see her kids.What is almost worse is when Mary complains about how she can't do anything, how if she had her own free will, she wouldn't have done X. She could have put up a little more defense, tried a little harder, pushed a little more. Or she could have just been kicked out of her family. But personally, I like Queen Katherine's response to Mary's BS best:\\"If you had not been tempted, you would not have fallen. If it was not in your interest to betray me, then you would have been loyal. Go away, Lady Carrey. You are no better than your sister, who pursues her own ends like a weasel and never glances to one side or the other.\\"And that leads to my other complaint. Mary likes to think she is way better than her sister, Anne...but most of what Anne does, Mary has done before. Or she gloats (and I mean GLOATS) about what she didn't do. Such as:+ When Anne was sent to Hever, Mary writes Anne every week and gushes about her pregnancy and how the King lurves her so much.+ Enjoying how Anne has to wait on her, then being p!ssy when the tables are turned.+ Being upset when Anne gets married to the King, but legitimizes her affair with the King (in fact, I never felt that Mary was at all guilty for sleeping with the married King or committing adultery against her own husband).+ Being upset when Anne is pregnant with the King's baby, but when she was pregnant, she rubbed her sister's nose in it.And then we have how she has an affair and can't BELIEVE how her husband William Carey is upset at her (uh, duh?) or her claim to be loyal to the Queen even though she is sleeping with the King. For the latter, she even names the child she bore through Henry after Queen Katherine! (How tacky!)But it seems that Mary is supposed to be the perfect, sweet sister. She is loyal to the Queen, even turning against her sister. At one point, Mary becomes a confidant of sorts to the Queen, and the two giggle about how awful Anne is--sure, that's believable! We also know Mary is \\"good\\" because she wants to abandon court life for country life after a mere 3 month stay at Hever! And then, when she becomes a farmer's wife, she ADORES making cheese and cooking and has NO PROBLEMS with all the work she suddenly has to do. And while Anne meets a terrible end, Mary gets a happily ever after--her children, a loving husband, a little farm, and all the things she ever wanted.Instead of being the perfect, sweet, innocent, beleaguered sister, Mary came across as a dense, two-faced, passive hypocrite, unable to do anything for herself, who somehow got everything she wanted but didn't deserve.But as much as I despised Mary, I adored Anne and Queen Katherine. Sure, Anne is personified as a bawdy devil, a woman desperate for power and the Queen's throne instead of an intelligent, highly religious woman who really did love the King, but I felt that a lot of what she did was understandable. She was smart and cunning; when her family didn't support her (and for a good portion of the book, it seemed they did EVERYTHING to make her life miserable), she made her own way using her own wits and skill. Mary needed guiding throughout her entire time of her affair; Anne was more than capable of handling herself. Her struggles to give birth to a son were heart-rending; her desperation understandable (not that I really believe she slept with her brother or was a witch). As for Queen Katherine, she was a respectable woman, a good wife. I felt bad for how King Henry put her away in favor of Anne.As for the rest of the characters, they are pretty one-dimensional. King Henry is ALMOST ALWAYS called a \\"boy\\" by Mary, which was irritating and disturbing. King Henry, I always got the impression, was a pretty strong, charismatic guy. I'm sure he had some childlike aspects, but I felt nearly every other time Mary saw him, she was comparing him to a child. If Mary found him so childlike, how could she have a years-long affair? Ew! Jane Parker is so snoopy and awful; Jane Seymour is so virtuous and sickeningly pure; Uncle Thomas was pure evil; George honestly felt campy gay (I'm surprised more people didn't find out about his orientation); William Stafford is so \\"wonderful\\" and \\"manly\\", I wanted to be sick. None of them really stood out; none of them felt like people whom I could interact with and meet on a daily basis.A key component of this story, the whole reason I believe it was written, was to show the competition between the two sisters, to compare and contrast. But while The Cranes Dance did an EXCELLENT job of showing two sisters who love each other but feel threatened by each other as well, this book flopped. I felt like both girls hated each other viscerally, until one of them would do something unexpectedly nice to the other or say how fond they were of their sister (and mean it).Another thing that I felt really hurt the story was one key historical component. I know I said I wouldn't nitpick history, but I felt this component REALLY affected the story. There is NO WAY Mary's son would have ever been considered an heir apparent to the King, even if he were to marry her after the fact. The King already had an illegitimate son through Bessie Blount; he would have been the first in line if illegitimate children were in line for the throne. So all of the family's crazy talk and effort to get Mary married to King Henry and how their illegitimate son would be heir is silly and ultimately pointless. Sure, if the King married Mary, she MIGHT have another son, but that is the only way for an heir to come.After Mary's affair with the King, the story really stops being about her and is instead about Anne. I guess it makes sense, but when the story tries to return to being about Mary, it is boring and so drowned in sugary, sweet sappiness, I thought I was going to go into a coma. Mary and William are a boring couple. They meet, they fall in love, life goes perfectly for them (with a few mild speedbumps that are IN NO WAY Mary's fault). William is not at all frustrated with Mary for being unable to do simple household tasks; Mary loves being a housewife and getting her hands rough and dirty. William is A-OK with Mary's earlier affair; Mary has no problem giving up court life to live in the country. Oh, and they have AMAZING MIND-BLOWING SEX. The relationship COULD have been interesting; these two characters come from wildly different worlds. But because Mary has to have everything turn out perfect for her, there was no drama.I must commend PG (or her editors, future books will tell which of those is true) on the brisk pace. Very rarely does the book just sit around and do nothing; for the most part, the story moves and is pretty engaging. I might not have liked some of the characters, but I WAS interested in seeing how they would turn out. And I listened to this book to the very end with little regret for the time I put into it (and I've regretted many a book I've sat listening to through to the end).One more thing: Susan Lyons, you are an amazing narrator! Pat yourself on the back!I do not recommend this book for history buffs or hard-core Tudor enthusiasts, but for those that don't mind some mindless, deliciously catty entertainment, this is a decent read. At the very least, it will make you head to the library or the ebook store or to Wiki to do some research of the time; at the best, you will have spent a few hours (depending on whether you are reading or listening, of course) immersed in a time left behind long ago. I certainly don't regret the time I spent listening to it or the new knowledge I have of the Tudors.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Phillippa Gregory is one of my favourite authors when it comes to historical fiction, and she lived up to my expectations in this book too, I didnt know much about Henry VIII and the tudor period before I read this book, and I feel like I got a bigger knowledge now about that time. I like when books can make me feel something like happiness, anger, sadness etc. and this book managed to do that."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn girl was a highly engrossing novel, and while there was an amazing story to be had, it was not without its faults. But first, the good! Gregory delved into her characters and was easily able to make the reader sympathetic to at least the plights of Mary and her children, constructing rich characters straight from the pages of history. Also, as the book went along, I found more and more that I just couldn't put the book down, especially after page 250 or so. It was entertaining, especially having known the history of the Boleyn family, and combined that special amount of historical fact and fictive embellishment to create a very entertaining novel.On the other hand, there were a few faults to be had, which lowers my score by only a star. The end was very sudden and forced, and by that point things just were wrapped up in the blink of an eye. The climax of the story in my opinion happened three pages before the end of the book. The book seemed too long and drawn out in parts, especially at the beginning in the first two hundred pages.All in all, this is definitely a book I would recommend for those looking for a more fictive retelling of history. Gregory took the truth and made it more interesting to modern day readers."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I admit it. I was completely ignorant of the story of Anne and Mary Boleyn. I guess it's historical or something. And I had no intention of reading something that at first glance looked like some bodice-ripper in need of an editor. But one chapter in, and I was hooked.The medieval (or maybe it's simply \\"historical\\", I don't know) setting is expertly crafted. Scenes, props, costumes, dialogue -- all of it feels authentic. The book sucks you into a king's court, and provides a fascinating glimpse into the minds of several courtiers. At its core, the book is perhaps a champion of women's rights, but the intriguing gamesmanship of the major players turns it into something more than message-y melodrama.The whole thing hinges on the relationship between the two sisters, and the complexity here is far beyond simple sibling rivalry. I think it's to your advantage if you slept through history class, since you won't see the twist ending coming. The story definitely took a different spin once Mary Boleyn began to wane and Anne Boleyn began to rise. The final pages provide a shocking conclusion. I'm sure liberties were taken to make the story more \\"cinematic,\\" but it's a fine novel worthy of the time investment."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I would put this novel up there in my top two or three picks. If you really want an interesting view of King Henry the Eighth and his wives from a new perspective, read this book. It hooks you right away and never lets up. I didn't want to do anything but read till I finished the story, and the details are still so fresh in my head even though I read the book two years ago.The movie was surprisingly well done, though, understandably, much was left out. The character of the mother was also different.I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Many reviewers are condemning Miss.Gregory for the harsh portrayal she made on Anne Boleyn (Introducing her as a power hungry/evil woman who manipulates other people's feelings and is striving for Global recognition) In short Miss.Gregory has used all those false/inaccurate accusations that were against Anne Boleyn as solid facts in this novel to further our dislike for her person. As if it weren't enough that the character is already portrayed as an ungrateful/spawn of Satan/absolute b*tch to everyone around her including and perhaps especially her own innocent sister but it is also strongly suggested that Anne Sleeps with her own Brother George and for what you say ? For creating a male heir, when Henry couldn't give her one when Tudor England was a time commoners and nobles heck even doctors alike all believed women were responsible for their child's sex !I'm not sure if the author was willing to neglect this fact like what she did so frequently while writing this book but the science of genetics didn't exist in Tudor England. We know this things now after years and years of research but people back then [weren't] aware of the X & Y chromosomes. So for Anne Boleyn to commit incest with her brother George [because he can give her a *male* heir to the throne] is not only improbable but highly inaccurate.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't help us as [readers] sympathize or empathize with Mary Boleyn [Who is portrayed as the sweet/naive/innocent girl that falls into the claws of her overly ambitious family] which is something Miss.Gregory very clearly wants us to do. Historical inaccuracies aside there isn't much likable about Mary's Characterization in this novel she is represented as a sweet/innocent child of 13 [I know it was common for women to marry early back then] but yet she already commits adultery with the King and avoids her husband in the process but it's O.K because her family forced her into this. She betrays her Queen Katherine of Argon by stealing the letters she sends to her Spanish relations for her family to use it in their spawn but yet again that's perfectly suitable because she loves Katherine. Her Husband eventually dies and Mary gets over his death in lighting speed [which is perfectly fine but doesn't render any affection towards the character] then she falls in love with another man, marries him and leaves her maddening sister to her own devices which would render her downfall. A sister that she doesn't even care about and hates.The Plot yet again doesn't make sense. If we were to believe that the Boleyns really pushed their daughters into the arms of King Henry VIII and eventually into his bed [Yet again another inaccurate assumption/doubtful] and that both Mary's children were Henry's [yet again another improbability] then one keeps wondering why would the Boleyns replace the Younger [more] fertile sister with the Older and shrewish sister ?Anne Boleyn wasn't a Power maniac who seduced the King ruthlessly and tricked him into marrying her. Thus ruining her family's good graces and digging her own grave. It is was [death] to disobey the King. If Henry VIII wanted Anne in his bed it would've been really foolish for her to tell him [NO] or to run away. She knew the destiny of her sister Mary and how she was no more than a mistress, she probably didn't want to repeat that fate and did what she could with what she had. Got the best out of the situation. Whatever Anne was it is clear enough that Henry wanted her badly to not only leave his Queen of so many years for a woman of no noble blood but to break with the Church of Rome in a time were the protestant faith was looked upon as heresy.If Anne was [What] this novel claims then it's a wonder she didn't have her head cut off the first five minutes she entered the court. I'm Not a fan of Anne Boleyn having more interest in her daughter Elizabeth but she was more than just sex and lies. I know it's Historical [Fiction] and the authors take some liberties but show the woman was some slack. And the reformation ? Show us that this is what had caused England years and years of Religious turmoil.Can this Novel be enjoyable ? Yes, but only if one treated it as the way it should be a [fictional] account plucked out of the author's imagination Not as what Miss.Gregory want us to treat as which is Historical facts or High Probabilities.PS, It is mentioned somewhere in the novel that Anne & Mary's mother has also been rumored to sleep with the King. In this light the author portrays the Boleyns as nothing short of concubine providers for the King's amusement which is ridicules and unnecessary. Plus, almost disturbing to think that Henry was possibly but improbably a father to either Mary or Anne ! [Disgusting]PSS, The author claims to be a feminism writer and wants to show that in her novels. I think derogatory is the more accurate term. Portraying women who are sex slaves as angels while ambitious once as evil to society."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"'The Other Boleyn Girl' centers on the relatively unknown life of 16th-century aristocrat Mary Boleyn (little sister to the famously headless Anne Boleyn) and her affair with King Henry VIII, as well as the subsequent fury to push the (as yet) headstrong Anne to the throne when, after bearing his son, Mary fails to hold the king's interest. The story takes place mainly in the heavy walls of the kings castles and court, but also follows Mary home to her farm in Hever.Plenty of intrigue, jealousy, rivalry, politics, and even real romance in this one. The main conflict centers on Henry's inability to bear a male heir to the throne. Mary's father and uncle propose that pretty Mary bed the king and bear him a son. She manages this competently while her jealous sister and grinning brother play her maids, then the tables turn, and the Boleyns decide that Mary (who is, unfortunately, married) cannot bear a legitimate son. If they can be rid of King Henry's barren wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, Anne might have a shot at the throne. So Anne, who little respects Mary's apparent love for the king, steps in with all the power of her female wiles and scathing intelligence, and manipulates her way into Henry's mind.Then comes the annulment of the marriage of King Henry and Catherine of Aragon -- a move orchestrated by Anne which inevitably puts into the king's hands the power (and inclination) to be rid of a wife when she can bear him no sons. They marry, and the Boleyns scramble in an unrelenting game to keep boyish King Henry interested in his wife. The question - can she bear him a son?I prefer Anne to Mary because her wit and scheming cruelness intrigues me (as a reader!), but I like that Gregory chooses the little-known Boleyn as her narrator. This gives the tale a bit of frailty and sympathy it would lack with Anne as its teller. The girls' brother George gets some stage-time too, as a blushing boy pal and servant to the king, with a private scandal of his own to sully his family's name and bring the tale's finale clashing upon the Boleyns.I know there's been a lot of flack about the accuracy of the history in this novel. Didn't Anne love Elizabeth (her daughter) by accounts? Were the claims about Anne and George accurate? Weren't Mary and her mother close? Did Mary really prefer the farm life? Really - in the 16th century? Did the downfall occur due to political leanings?I can't say a word on all that, as I don't know the history. (Though I've heard the book follows truth far better than the movie. For example, Henry actually ages and gets fat.) I can only judge the novel for its entertainment value and mastery in writing, of which it has plenty.Perhaps years from now I'll look back on it and lose respect for the holes in the history, for the disrespect shown Anne and George in the depiction of them, for the role given an uncle who, in truth, barely consulted his own family. But right now, very new to literature and looking for the tricks to writing, I can only applaud Gregory for a novel competently (brilliantly!) written, with characterization that fired the pages and conflict enough to keep me up by night. I enjoyed this one from ironic start to steely finish."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I do not usually like historical novels, but this was wonderful.

Queen Catherine's resolute resistance is not recounted. More and Fisher and the terror of The Act of Succession get two paragraphs. Wolsey's key role and tragic fall are barely mentioned.The scurrilous rumors of George Boleyn's perversions are taken as fact and are given as motivation for much of the endgame. Anne's loss of the 2nd baby is not connected to Henry's fall from the horse.There are myriads and myriads of departures from the known facts.

She was not an innocent teenager when she began her affair with Henry; she had already earned a bad reputation during her youth in France. There is no convincing evidence that her family pushed her into Henry's bed, or that they were rewarded for doing so. Her father and her husbands were already faithful servants of the king; the titles and lands they received from him were no more than what would be expected for their service. The king made some provision for Mary's daughter Catherine, who was almost certainly his, but none for her son Henry, who probably was not. There is no evidence that Anne ever slept with Percy, or that she poisoned anybody, or that there was a secret band of homosexuals gathered around her at court, or that she ever considered incest with her brother.On the contrary, the Boleyns were known for their devotion to the Reformers' cause, long before the king's eye landed on the younger daughter of the house. As queen, Anne gave generously to support the New Learning and appointed Reforming priests where she could. She was little liked by the mass of the people, who never really gave her a chance, but there were also those who respected her - such as Archbishop Crammer, who owed his career to her intervention. For a better account of her and her sister, read... almost anything else. But specifically Mary Boleyn: Mistress of Kings by Alison Weir or To Die For: A Novel of Anne Boleyn by Sandra Byrd."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a piece of trash and a gem at the same time!! (NOTE: as many of you know, and now know, I'm a history buff.) The Tudors being one of my favorite periods, so naturally, I've read up on it a lot. So I know what I'm talkin' bout when I say: \\"WHAT A LOAD OF BALONEY!\\" Honestly, I cannot believe what kind of nonsense people go off believing after watching or seeing the movie. I hate to be all negative, but man, there is just not that much to be happy about. I mean sure, if I were some ignorant kid reading this book after hearing very little about Henry the 8th and his many queens and his issues, then I would've surely enjoyed this one. After all, who doesn't love a good historical fiction novel?BUT I GET IT. It's \\"historical \`fiction'. I know...it's just, I was hoping for a little more truth, you know? There were so many historical inaccuracies here that I was tempted to start a list. I figured that would be a bit rude on Ms. Gregory's part so I resisted the urge. But it was strong! Everywhere, left and right, was either a highly controversial \\"fact\\" or just a faint rumor that had died out centuries before our time. Look, now, I'm a patient gal, I don't mind a few rumors here and there, but this DRIPPED them.On a happier note, I thoroughly enjoyed Philippa's accounts of Mary enjoying her summers at Hever, hearing about William Stafford, and her genuine view of things. I wasn't expecting Mary as the narrator, but it was a pleasant surprise. Lots of people complained of the love scenes, I was expecting to find the author set up the scene and then leave the rest for us to assume. Oh no, my readers! This is not what happened. Philippa was descriptive, but not to the point where it was just plain dirty.To address the George issue, Gregory wasn't very clear on if George & Anne were really closer than brother and sister. She lead us on...and then dropped us. I took the \\"George being gay\\" rumor in stride. (If you're wondering why this is in quotes, it's because this is a highly controversial idea on The Boleyn Family).It was a little part in the story, so I read and moved on.Rating this was hard, but I was thinking of you, dear precious readers, and how most of you probably AREN'T big-time history buffs. So, in all fairness, I gave this a nice big RECOMMENDED. If you're a fan of historical fiction, and don't mind a few love scenes, then you might enjoy this one.MEMORABLE QUOTES:\\"...But instead I was the lucky Boleyn, the Boleyn blessed by fortune and the king's favor.

It was really interesting to read from Mary Boleyn's POV- the sister of Anne. A lot of pieces in this book are actually factual. It was fascinating and I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have just finished reading this, and now want to get other historical novels by the same author. I was so sad to finish it and wished it could have gone on forever. It is written with a knowledgable hand, and the detail has made the historical statistics we know MUCH more real for me.... more personal. If you enjoy historically-based novels, do not pass this one up. I also recommend The Boleyn Inheritance by this same author... nice to read that one first if you want to have more of a cohesive timeline. There may be others that fall in with the timeline, and I will be ordering those, too!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Loved this book! I couldn't wait to read it again each day, I dreamed about it. Started to get a little slow around pg 500, but I stuck it out. Makes me glad I was born in the 20th century.a lot of criticism I've read pertains to historical inaccuracies, but that didn't bother me. It's fiction!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was my first introduction into historical fiction. I became very intrigued with the entire Tudor Dynasty because of the show The Tudors on Showtime. I came across Philippa Gregory and decided to give this book a try. The Other Boleyn Girl was extremely powerful especially being told by Mary, Anne Boleyn's sister. Mary and Anne are basically used by their father to gain access to the King. Even though Mary not only turns the King's eye but also births him a child. To make sure the King doesn't tire of her, their father puts Anne in the kings way. Mary tells her story and you can sense the pain and aggravation in her voice. To see that your own father would go to such lengths and ultimately watch the demise of his own children is so sad. However, told through his daughters experiences watching her brother and sister killed for their actions, its mind boggling that King Henry allowed her to live. I connected with Mary in the way that regardless how she was treated by Anne, she still was loyal to the end. Mary protected her as much as possible even though Anne treated her awful. Anne knew she had met her end and Mary promises to make sure her daughter Elisabeth is taken care of.I recommend this book and all of the Tudor novels written by Philippa Gregory to anyone who loves true historical fiction. Philippa brings such realism and symbolism to her novels. Because of reading her novels, I have become a huge European History buff."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was very in depth and made me question the bonds of loyalty and family and the choices we must make in our lives. Shows how different things used to be. Kept my attention the whole time and I loved all the surprises along the way!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Really interesting read if you like early England and the courts of the kings and queens. Well written and gave insight into how it could have felt to be a girl born during that time and in their particular cast. Written from the perspective of the Anne's sister and gave one a picture of the King, Henry the VIII and just how ruthless he really was. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2MDG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved the book! I'm not a historical expert in this time period, but I enjoyed it immensely. I thought Philippa's writing style is easy to follow. There's a lot of detail in this book, and I think she does an amazing job of presenting everything to the reader without being complicated or fussy. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I like this story as a story. It entertains and keeps me reading. As a book that is suppose to be about history though it isn't as good. I'm no history student but I know enough to know alot of what is put in this book is made to sound more important than it is in terms of Anne herself. Many of the rumors and such.The characters were interesting and except for a few places that got a little slow the story moved along pretty good. I can say it was a good story but not great because I kept feeling like the writer was making so much of it up that it was messing with the real people of history too much. I know its fiction but even so I think a writer should only go so far in making up the stuff no one can be certain about.So its a good and entertaining story but not enough real history that it kept me feeling that most of what I read was invented by the writer."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"i am going to keep it simple..... beautiful book.. worth the read... i would totaly lose track of time when i was reading... i became so into the story"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Another great novel by Philippa Gregory. She tells the story of Ann Boleyn with a different perspective and includes english history with knowledge and interest. I had just recently purchased one of her books at the bookstore and was hooked. I now have ordered 9 of her books from Amazon.com. Great stuff if you like historical novels."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The books was wonderful. I read the book in two sittings, and did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was engrossed page by page with the story, King Henry and his relationships with Mary Bolyn, then Anne, then Jane Seymore. I was totally fascinated by the lifestyle of the courts, and how the boleyn family probably lived...Totally fascinating and best book of her series!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What can I say about this book, is one of my all time favorites, and have read it several times,and have recommended it and loaned my book to many friends, and family members. The author makes you feel like you are part of the action, and I enjoyed the movie version as well. Want to put it on my Kindle soon."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This novel was my first introduction to The Tudors, and it had me hooked from the start. I thought it was brilliant to tell the story of Anne Boleyn through her sister. I remembered that feeling of sisterly competition, and appreciated the honesty from the main character, Mary. I read most of the book on a 36 hour flight itinerary, and couldn't have chosen a better time because I had the luxury of reading for hours on end. I now realize that this book is actually #2 out of 6, and intend to start reading the others."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was one of the first historical novels I read (I started withThe Constant Princess (Boleyn)) I was already familiar with this period in history, but I loved reading it from Mary's perspective. I was surprised how cruel and calculating the Boleyns (the parents and Anne as well as their Howard uncle, the Duke of Norfolk) were portrayed. Anne was especially cruel to her sister and Queen Katharine. Though Mary never gained much in the way of titles and riches, she fares the best out of the clan.Gregory took some interesting takes here on the incest that Anne and George were accused of, as well as working Retha Warnicke's theory on George's sexuality into the plot. Many Tudor historical novels I've read show Henry VIII stooping to mind boggling depths of self delusion and hypocrisy to justify his actions and this book achieves that as well. It is hard not to see him as a spoiled child rather than a great ruler."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While learning a little history, the fictionalized account of the characters is also entertaining. The entire series is really good."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I initially picked up this book because I loved the movie. I immediately realized that this powerfully written book far eclipsed the movie. Set in the court of Henry VIII, this is the intriguing story of the Boleyn Girls, Anne and Mary. The characters come to life as they fight for the King's affection and advancement of their family. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book captivated me. Although, this book is a fiction, it provided historical information on the wives of Henry VIII. The Tudor dynasty has intrigued me throughout the years and this book gave me information which I did not know and it provided a wonderful novel to read. I truly enjoyed it. My next will be The Boleyn Inheritance, which I understand is as good a read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend. I can say I absolutely loved this book. It held my interest all the way through. I love how the author weaves historical fact with fiction. This book has insprired me to learn more about that period and about the wives of Henry VIII. I have recommended it to my Book Club."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling story and it is easy to see why it is so successful. I felt caught up in the court life during Henry VIII's reign. My biggest problem is the heavy-handed treatment of the characters - Anne Boleyn is too ruthless and ambitious; Mary is just too good; Henry is one-dimensional. The history license taken is considerable but not surprising given the premium placed on writing a juicy tale.In spite of books shortcomings, I enjoyed this as a guilty pleasure. I will probably check out other works by Gregory from my local library. I would rather spend my money on books by writers like Roberta Gellis or Sharon Kay Penman because they write higher quality historical romances."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was one of those stay up late to read type books. I picked this book because the description on the back flap sounded interesting, not because I wanted learn about Tudor England or any other historical facts related to this period. I read this as I would read any other fiction, which by the way is a class of literature comprising works of \\"imaginative narration\\". After some reviews on this site, did I realize that not everything in this book is accounted for and can be proven, such as birth order of Boleyn girls, etc. Those quetsions didn't bother me only because I was reading this book for entertainment purposes, not for historical accuracy. I do have a newfound interest in this period of time in England and will look into more non-fiction works to get more factual information.I would recommend this if you want to a read an intruiging historical FICTION."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Wow--this book was really enjoyable! I mean, we all know how this ends, but the inbetween stuff was really good. I grew to love most of the characters and then I grew to hate them too, especially Anne and Henry, they both turned out to be quite selfish and horrible. Mary and George were portrayed as quite human--flawed, but trying hard to be good all the same. If George was anything like the character that Philippa Gregory portrays, then I am very sorry for the way he died. I usually start a story, get bored, and read the last chapter to see if I want to read the whole thing, but not with this book--I read it cover to cover. Then I got on the internet to read everything I could find on the Boleyn family. I cannot wait for the movie to come out, and I can only hope that it is at least half as good as the book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book surpassed everything I thought it would be. This is the best book I've read in a very long time..I have nothing more to say other then read it, you will love it, and want to read more books written by this author..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"So, with the Tudors on DVD and the newest Elizabeth movie out, I'm looking for an Elizabeth meets Mean Girls movie when this one comes out. The book was entertaining, told from the point of view of Mary, Anne Boleyn's shallow and clueless sister, and details the rise and fall of her family's place at Court. Both Mary's dalliance with the King and the snare of the King by her sister Anne, and Anne's fall are the setting of this fluffy romance novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The fact that so many have posted positive reviews speaks volumes about this book. And since there are more than several synopses, I'll forego that. Gregory has written a riveting historical about the Boleyn siblings, Anne, Mary, and George, and the relationships between King Henry VIII and, first, Mary as his mistress, followed by Anne, a crafty plotter who wanted nothing more than to be queen. We all know the tragic end to the story, but Gregory's retelling of this brief time in history is magical."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Captivating story of how the two Boleyn sisters, Mary and Anne, captured the heart of Henry VIII to fulfill their family ambitions. Mary is the \\"softie\\" who more or less genuinely falls for Henry and is used by her family to elevate themselves in Court. That's despite Mary being married, bearing two children for the King and despite her being a very young woman. Anne is quite the opposite of Mary, in that she is extremely ambitious, controlling and uses the King to fulfil her personal rise to fame. Without revealing the ending, this is a truly captivating story that will teach you a lot about life in court, power games, family ambitions during the reign of Henry VIII. I usually do not read historical fiction but made the exception for this book and I was not disappointed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I could not put this book down! Since I read this book, I have purchased several other of Philippa Gregory's Tudor books, The Constant Princess, The Boleyn Inheritance and now The Queen's Fool. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history with a twist. Read it before the movie comes out in Feb.!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a selection for my book club. I was actually dreading reading it b/c I'm not a big historical fiction fan. I LOVED this book! I could not put it down and read the entire thing (over 600 pgs.) over a week-long vacation. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested. It is a fascinating story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. It's really not the type of book I would read, but the movie trailer made me interested. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I typically don't read these kinds of novels, but this one kept my attention. Gregory's writing style is excellent. She gives what is an ordinary history lesson a fascinating look into a world of intrigue and deception. I'm now hooked on her style of story telling and have started reading the first book of her trilogy, \\"Wideacre\\", and again, I'm not dissappointed. BTW - I saw the movie (the Other Bolyen Girl).... read the book, it's better."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. As an aspiring writer, I've become a critical reader. I wouldn't buy one of Phillipa Greggory's books because I didn't believe they appealed to me. Although I love history, I couldn't believe that King Henry VIII's court would be interesting. Out of desperation for something good to read (because other reviews said it was an outstanding book) I bought it. This was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I love Phillipa Greggory's prose, her ability to absorb me into the time and place. I am awed by her intelligence and ability to take history and weave her story between the lines of actual events. Praise to the author. I bought another of her books today."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm not into the 'bodice-ripper' genre or historical fiction for that matter. But friends recommended this book to me, and I thought why not I'll read it on vacation. While the dialogue is fairly low-brow and the exposition at times veers dangerously into 'bodice ripper' territory, I was hooked early on. This is a pretty good (though not historically accurate) read, on a fascinating topic: the court of Henry VIII. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is one in a long line of Tudor historical fiction books that I have read. One thing in particular that stood out to me to recommend this book in particular is its point of view. Not only does it explore the perennially-neglected character of Mary Boleyn, but it also provides a rare complex portrayal of Anne Boleyn. Most historical fiction books either love Anne Boleyn or hate her - she is either the heroine or the villain. But in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" the unique perspective of her sister allows her to be seen flexibly in both roles. Another quality to recommend this book is its perspective on time. Most other books that I have read pare down the long, long courtship of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn and it was not until I read this book that I realized how remarkable it was that she held on to him so long. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"'s strength is its portrayal of characters and attempts to understand their motives."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the story of the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn as seen through the eyes of her less-well-known sister, Mary. It is a tale of passion and intrigue. In the beginning of the book, Mary is an obedient daughter of the Howard/Boleyn family. She marries William Carey at the age of 12. A few years later, when ordered to do so by her family, she leaves his bed to become the mistress of the king. In its quest for power, the family considers its daughters to be disposable fodder - used to attract and hold the king. It is only later, as Anne succeeds her as the king's favorite, that Mary decides to follow her own path. This contrasts with the fates of Anne and her borther George - who sacrificed all in their quest for power. The book also brings to fresh life the familiar Tudor personages - Henry VIII and his first three wives Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it. While I'm near the end, I'm reading it at a rapid pace because it's so addictive. There is something about his books that bring you in and get you hooked. and I'm loving this one."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book kept me riveted even though it is a long book; I didn't want to stop reading it. It certainly made the reign of King Henry VIII interesting! It also points out the sad fate of women in those days. But the main character, Mary Bolyn overcomes her fate by following her heart. This has been my favorite book this year, full of love, sex and ambition., and it is based on a true story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was on the lists for must read for summer, I was not sure about it and I am not into historical fiction until I read this book. I picked that for my book club and I read it in a week, my copy is 820 pages. I loved it, so did my partner at my book club. I learned about Tudors era and enjoyed the Mary and Anne's story.Excellent book, looking forward to read another book of the writer."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory is a genius. The best historical fiction author by far. This novel was amazing, so much rich detail from King Henry XIII to the Boleyn family and the offspring. Its magestic and enthralling. Makes you wish you could go back in time (not necessarily to be a Boleyn) but just to be in the court and to experience the wonderment that is Philippa Gregory's Tudor Engand."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have Philippa Gregory to thank for my new interest in history. It was a snooze in high school and now I am hooked on the stories and am learning about history too. I started with \\"The Constant Princess\\" which was an OK start, but then moved the \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" got hooked, and had to go on to The Boleyn Inheratance\\" and \\"The Queens Fool\\" - ALL great stories.I am now driven to learn as much about the British monarchy and other European monarchy as I can and am reading other authors to fill in other time frames. Still, Philippa is consistently the best (although there may be better stories on Elizabeth than \\"The Virgin's Lover\\"). Great period movies to see AFTER you are hooked are Elizabeth I (the HBO version is my favorite) and Queen Margo (French film). I got my friends hooked on Philippa too, so there is something interesting here, it's not just me."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! Extremely long books like this one (661 pages) usually turn me off, but each and every page of THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is an adventure within itself. Filled with mystery, tragedy, injustice, scandal, romance, heartbreak, and even the occasional touch of humor, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL provides an intimate and colorfully detailed portrait of life in Henry VIII's court over a period of 15 years. I was absolutely riveted and couldn't bear to put this book down until I reached the end. Now I want Philippa Gregory to write Elizabeth's story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I never thought that I would get through a book with this subject matter. However, a friend convinced me to give it a try...lo and behold, I could NOT put the book down, started reading it Wednesday and finished Saturday early am (661 pages). I was entranced and you will be as well...a refreshing perspective on sixteenth century goings-on! You won't be disappointed. A compelling read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love historical fiction and this book was one of the best I've read. The book never lags and it's a pageturner from start to finish. If you are especially addicted to English history, don't miss this book. It ranks right up there with those by Sharon Penman and Margaret George. You'll enjoy every minute of it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was enthralled immediately and absorbed through out the book. It's a fascinating, well told story which was even more interesting because it's historically accurate. I read a lot and haven't read a book I liked this much in a long time. It's just a great read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the story of the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn as seen through the eyes of her less-well-known sister, Mary.

Because thats what it seems like! This book was a big let-down. I bought it expecting a book about Anne and Mary Boleyn, not some evil witch and a snivveling brat. How can someone give this trash FIVE STARS?! Save yourself some money and leave this book on the shelf. Buy the Weekly World News instead. It's more accurate."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is a fun read. Don't have your expectations too high; this is more like a romance novel than historical fiction. I couldn't let the book go while I was reading it, but I didn't have any urge to pick it up again once I finished it.Mary Boleyn, the narrator of the book is portrayed as everything her scheming sister is not. Her personality is inconsistent - the author tried to make her torn between playing the role of \\"Boleyn girl\\" and just a girl who wants to live a happy, simple life; but I don't think that inner struggle was presented well enough - and as you can expect, while Anne gets her head chopped off by the brat king, Mary gets a good-looking, handsome, and caring man."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book shows lots of possibilities, but while I am reading it I am distracted by her poorly written tag lines in her characters' dialogue, and her sex scenes are too graphic for my taste. She leaves little to the readers' imagination. Regarding the tag lines, she uses far too many adverbs, such as \\"Anne said desperately\\" or \\"he said staunchly.\\" In some cases, they are repeated on several different pages. Such -ly adverbs should have all been edited out, except for the ones which concern the volume of a characters' speech (e.g. \\"He said softly\\" is acceptable, because \\"softly\\" cannot be shown by a character's body language, etc., whereas emotions can. In short, simple \\"he said's\\" and \\"she said's\\" should have been all she used. Adverbial tag lines are distracting."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have read \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\", \\"The Queen's Fool\\" and this one. All three were very entertaining, but light on accuracy. OK, so the author took license. But, as I have studied Tudor history for years, it is a little irritating that so many liberties were taken. Nevertheless, I will probably read the others in the series.\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is satisfying in its descriptions of the court and times. The story line interesting, telling Mary Boleyn's story, neglected by many historians. The most maddening thing about all Gregory's books is her use of poor grammar. Surely, an author writing about English history should not so ill use the Queen's English!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Philippa Gregory did an amazing job capturing the era and the history behind King Henry VIII and the Boleyn girls. I love a great book and this one is probably my all-time favorite. I would recommend this wonderful book to anyone and everyone! Now I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn girl tells the story of Mary, King Henry the VIII's mistress before he met and married Mary's sister, the more well-known Ann.This is a great story, beautifully written and completely interesting from beginning to end. Written from Mary's point of view, the story elaborates on the theme that both Mary and Ann were pawns in the Boleyn family's push for upward mobility.This is the first book I have read by Philippa Gregory, and I am looking forward to receiving The Queen's Fool so that I may read that, as well. There are events in her novel, however, that some historians do not believe occurred. For instance, in this book, Henry fathers Mary's first two children while she was married to (but living separately from) her husband. Some historians dispute this allegation and believe that Mary was the king's mistress prior to her marriage and that her children were the offspring of both Mary and her husband--and concieved very much after the affair ended. Regardless, these are events that will most likely always be in dispute and have been, thus far, impossible to prove definitively either way. And, Philippa Gregory chooses the option that makes for a better story and more empathetic character. Good for her.This novel transports the reader through time and is difficult to put down. I also recommend The Autobiography of Henry VIII, by Margaret George, for another fictionalized first-person account of this era in British history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A quest for power. Three siblings who resent, compete against, and yet love one another in a twisted one. The retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn, her sister Mary, and Brother George, and how the quest for power made them enemies and ultimately ended in Anne's premature death. Gripping tale with new insight into an old historic story.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions.

The author does a wonderful job of filling in the framework of history with rich detail and bringing to life believable characters. I couldn't put this book down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is incredible. I read it in a week (and I don't consider myself to be a fast reader). Now I'm lending it to all the women I know (5 so far; all of them loved it. My mother-in-law read it in two days. TWO DAYS!)"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was intimidated by the size of this novel, but was very quickly drawn into this tale of Mary, the lesser known of the Boleyn girls. The author does a fabulous job of making these historical sisters come to life and presents a compelling tale beginning at Anne Boleyn's introduction to the English court, always showing them as three-dimensional people with real desires, needs, and inner conflicts due to their outer circumstances.I found it so intriguing to learn more about this time period and the relationship of Anne to Mary, and to their family, and to the royal family. As with many of Gregory's books, I feel like I know these people who lived long ago and want to learn more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was great. 600 pages and I read it in a week. It kept me spellbound and tells us the story of Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary. She is the mistress of King Henry VIII but it is Anne who marries him. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have never read any of Philippa Gregory's previous books but now I find myself looking to read all of them!! I loved the way there are so many plots happening, as well as the historical references. I read this book in two days!!! I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting and fun read with alot of plots. Looking forward to more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Okay enough reviews on this already. Here's something short and sweet... I read this book within 3 or 4 days, after my children have gone to bed. I couldn't wait to finish reading this book cover to cover. Now that I've finished the book, I just know I'll be disappointed by watching the film version."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you thinking for days afterwards. I could not put it down. Although the story focus is on Anne Boleyns sister and thier relationship, it is a fascinating look at the lives of women of that particular time period. Very thought prevoking."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My review is below after my beef:It boggles my mind that people write essays on Amazon as to why this book was historically inaccurate and give it a one or two star even though the novel is blatantly fictional. It also boggles my mind how these same people bash Gregory for her \\"lack of research\\" and for portraying Anne Boleyn in an unsavory light. These same people discuss all their qualifications and degrees in their reviews to prove to us that they're smart and we should listen to them...the pretentious tone in most is nauseating. All I have to say to those people is this...I guess you didn't do YOUR research before you bought the book and committed to reading it. That must have sucked for you.I give this book a strong four stars!!! This was a great read and captivated me all the way through. It's an easy read and gives you a sense of the era, without excessive descriptions. It's a \\"never-boring\\" page turner and is FICTION based on real historical figures. It inspired me to research the era on my own and dig deeper - I love when a book does that. So, if you simply want a joy ride and a glimpse of the Tudor period ...pick up this book and transport yourself."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Now, I do not mind some artistic freedom, I.E. condensing the time frame, adding new characters and events as long as the truth remains intact. Not so here and as a modern woman it SICKENS me to see a nobody like Mary Boleyn who, during her time, was known as a slut and stupid, easy tramp, being elevated to be innocent heroine while a a fascinating, brilliant woman like Anne Boleyn is turned into a tasteless, swearing, slutty bitch. Where is Anne's wit, her elegance, her charm and her lively humor? Hasn't poor Anne been maligned enough? And this author even believes that she committed incest and adultery, something that NO historian worth his money would agree with? Warnicke, the historian Gregory based some of her theories on, frigging distanced herself from this drivel, what does that tell you?Another thing that BUGGED me senseless: The portrayal of Henry as a pedophile, screwing 13 year old Mary Boleyn. YUCK.Badly researched, distorted, perverted and sickening drivel posing a literature. And of course this pile of rotten garbage will be a huge movie next year, trash always secures profit while the truth may not be \\"interesting\\" enough. It took centuries to clear at least most of Anne's reputation from all the filth thrown at her by ignorant fools. Now all that work will be rendered useless by this awful book and the upcoming film. BRAVO, Miss Gregory, I hope you're happy! Absolutely revolting and disgusting!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"When I saw \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" in stores next to books by Tracy Chevalier, I assumed it would be the same style of writing -- elegant, understated, and ultimately heartwrenching. For some reason, though, I was reluctant to pay full price for it. I eventually picked it up at the library, and was confirmed in my hesitation.For a book where plot and intercharacter relationships are essentially the same thing, I came away from \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" without understanding many of the crucial relationships. Gregory tells us what characters do, but not why they do it, nor how they feel. When she does touch on emotions, the writing falls flat, and the event is trivialized. Worse in my eyes, though, is Gregory's treatment of the book's darker themes. She hints at events that are never seen by the protagonist. By the novel's completion, neither the main character nor the reader is quite certain what occurred.The only thing that saved \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" from a one star review is the amount of detail and research that was obviously put into life in the court of Henry VIII. It is the book's saving grace, but it's not worth trudging through 672 pages. If you're looking for some easy, worthwhile reading, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is a good read. The author is a very able storyteller, allowing us a glance into the interiors of Tudor England and Henry VIII's court. Her characters are mostly to be pitied as we see the push and pull of great families vying for political and social dominance in the realm. In this society, daughters are bought and sold like prized cattle, their families acknowledging that they were no more than pawns in the courtly game.No one knows much about the life of Mary Boleyn, however the major events and general outline of her life are understood and followed somewhat accurately in this novel. Because of this obscurity, Philippa Gregory uses it to her advantage and invents the feelings and emotions of those around her, at the same time giving us a fresh look into the events surrounding her family and of course her sister. Gregory may take too many liberties with the attitude of the characters; she shapes Anne Boleyn into a hateful devil-woman and perhaps allows Mary to be a bit too innocent. Other than those issues the only problem I had with the book were technical.Her use of adverbs is incessant, everyone always replies harshly, coyly, triumphantly, and miserably, coldly, etc. You get the idea. The other problem I noticed was some time period inconsistencies. Obviously it is a historical novel, but there are many times when she will laps into modern phrases and ideas, I know she must do this to get her point across, but it sticks out like a sore thumb. For instance: \\"Mary went downstairs to get a pen and paper to write a note to the king\\". I don't believe in sixteenth century anywhere the use of pens or paper was existent. Maybe she could have said a quill and parchment or something. Anyway that is just one example and for all of these discrepancies.She makes up for it with her ability to tell a story and her written dialog I found myself wrapped up in the exchanges, they were wonderful and quick. The voice of her characters really comes out here.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, or anyone who is interested in this time period. It is a fresh perspective into the life of an obscure woman and a lesson on the treatment and role of women in this society."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is great! I love all of Philippa Gregory's books but this one was just amazing. I was having a hard time putting it down! She did a wonderful job at taking you into the time of King Henry's court and making you feel that you were actually there listening to the conversations and watching all of the scandal unfold before your eyes. I recommend this to anyone!I am a BIG fan of Anne Boleyn. I actually make Anne Boleyn jewelry based on pieces she wore on the tv show The Tudors. [...]"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm surprised how well this book is reviewed. It is an interesting topic and Gregory obviously had to do some research to write a historical novel. However, I wished she had also remembered to work on her writing skills. I found this book to lack intimacy, which is so strange considering it is written in 1st person. At times, it was so detached and seemed to just be a run down of details. I didn't feel anything for Mary or the other main characters. Mary's voice completely lacked a personal touch. I didn't understand the main character's internal being, and the book was over 600 pages. Really good writers can make you feel for and understand a main character in a short story. With this book, I felt like I was reading a rough draft that hadn't yet been flushed out and revised to include richer word choices, better character connection, metaphor, etc. It just really lacked something.That said, I found the topic interesting so I went and saw the movie. The movie, though only 2 hours, demonstrated more of the character's thoughts and passions and fears and motivation than the book did. Usually it is the opposite - a book gives you so much more than a movie possibly can. Not in this case."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My friend gave me this book since she knew I liked historical novels. Let's get one thing straight. This is a fictional account on some historical and empirical facts. So with that in mind, this book is nothing else but a harlequin romance novel. If you enjoy this genre, then you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What a story, what a writer, what a well written tale. From page one of this long book, the reader knows how this epic will end. In spite of this, Gregory paints a marvelous story with excellent writing and brilliant imagination. Is it true? Yes and no. We all know the story of Henry VIII and his collection of wives. We have studied the history of the Tutor period, but to weave facts into fascinating fiction takes a writer who can turn a phrase and this lady does. I don't even like &quot;historic tales&quot; but this one kept me reading into the night. Brava. Good job, highly recommended, best book I've read in months."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'll let readers get a description of the book from the many other reviews posted here. I give this three stars only because I think books like this should be enjoyed for what they are. It's a colorful, fast read. A beach book.But as history it is about 80 percent nonsense. Gregory credits Warnicke's The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn for the idea that Henry fell out of love with a thump because of the malformed fetus Anne aborted shortly before her arrest. However, Gregory apparently did not read much else. Among many, many facts in that book which Gregory chose to ignore was that Anne wasn't even brought back to court till early 1527, AFTER (and maybe because) Henry decided he must invalidate his marriage to Katherine. Everybody, especially Anne's father, knew the King was on the lookout for a new wife before he got rid of the old one. There is no doubt the King fell in love, but the depiction of Anne as a sexual schemer and Protestant revolutionary, and Henry as her victim, is simply Gregory's recycling of the slander memorialized by Nicholas Sander years after all the principals had died. I think Anne deserves better than that. She was a victim, just as all Henry's women were victims. As for Mary, from whose point of view the story is told: She was never one of the Queen's maids (how could she be? She was a married woman). She was at court because her husband was one of the King's Gentlemen. Her affair with the King was very brief, and she was packed off the moment it was known she had become pregnant, around May of 1525. She and Anne were not even at court together. So much for the value of history in \\"historical\\" fiction. Why don't we just call it fiction and leave it at that?"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Creating Anne Boleyn as the caricature of a mean spirited, ambitious and conniving woman perpetuates the myth that women are the downfall of men. It shows how Anne Boleyn is the temptation and how Henry VIII took the bait. In order to marry Anne, the King decides to renounce the Papacy and form his own Church.This book also doesn't do much in terms of any feminist interpretation of the Boleyn sisters. Gregory reinforces how the good and virtuous Mary ends up well taken care of and lives the life she always wanted by being patient, caring and loyal. On the other hand, Anne ends up beheaded because of her ambitions to be in a position of power. Is Gregory saying that all women who strive to be in a position of power are evil and conniving?I found this book to be in very poor taste. It was historically inaccurate and degrades women."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I could not put this book down. I found myself making excuses at work to steal off somewhere and read this book - even if I only had a chance to read one page. Based on the real life of Anne, Mary and George Boleyn as well as the court of King Henry the VIII - The Other Boleyn Girl is a MUST read.Mary, Anne's younger sister, is the main character in this novel and Philippa Gregory does an incredible job of bringing her to life and transporting the reader back to England in the 1500's. This fictional book is based on the true fact of Mary's affair with King Henry and the subsequent marriage of Henry and Anne as well as the beheadings of both Anne, George and half of Henry's court - The Other Boleyn girl is well written and fast paced and gives a credible and interesting back story to one of the most celebrated and notorious marriages England's history as well as bringing to light several individuals who have been relegated to the back pages of history - if they are mentioned at all.From life at the court to life in the fields, The Other Boleyn girl has it all, love, adventure and intrigue. This is by far, one of the best books I have read in ages."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was fascinated by this book, both by the history and the fiction. I thought Philippa Gregory did a wonderful job of recreating the court of Henry VIII. She paints a vivid picture of the ruthless ambition of the Boleyn family as well as the egomaniacal King Henry. They were all more than a bit frightening.This is the story of the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn as told by her sister Mary. Mary the younger of the two sisters was the first to find favor with the king. Her sister, as instructed by their father and uncle, won him over while Mary was giving birth to his child, all while his wife Katherine of Aragon sat by his side at the throne.I liked the Mary Boleyn that Gregory creates for us. She is able to see her family's all consuming ambition and where it leads them. She sees how her elders use her and her siblings in order to gain position, land and wealth. She examines her own loyalties and her betrayal of the one woman she loved like a mother. She was able to see history repeating itself for her sister. And she was horrified by the things her sister did to gain the throne and in her attempts to produce a future king. Mary is a sympathetic character and has a very interesting vantage point from which to tell this story.I enjoyed it and will be reading more Philippa Gregory.I had been putting off reading this book because of how long it was. I thought it would take a while to read since it is 661 pages long but it was very easy to read.

This is a tale of two sisters, b%#chy Anne and her unfortunate sister who gets to deal with her famous sibling. Of course we all know the ending, but England comes alive in ways it didn't in 10th grade history. Also gave a copy as a gift, and my friend enjoyed it as well."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The story line is well written, and I enjoyed the book overall. The characters are a bit hard to identify with, more flawed than admirable. However, the thing that bugged me about this book is that the story does not follow historical convention at all regarding the series of events that took place during Henry VII's reign. So enjoy the book as a fictional novel, and don't use it to supplement your history lesson!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was chosen for my book club. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It took me three days to read it. Gregory did an amazing job with her characters.I would put this down as a must read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Most people have heard of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII who was infamously beheaded when she failed to bear him a son (and whose daughter, Elizabeth, went on to become a great monarch). But few are aware that prior to Anne's rise, her sister, Mary, was the King's mistress and allegedly bore him two children. This novel seamlessly blends fact and fiction to tell the story of the Boleyn family, whose ambitions and aspirations caused them to put two daughters in harm's way. However, the story centers around the rivalry between the two sisters as well as their relationship with their brother, George Boleyn, who was executed just prior to his sister. A captivating tale about this fascinating period of history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I liked how it started, with the beheading of a relative. And details of court life were interesting, at the beginning, but became tedious with the repetitiveness. This book really could have been half or one-third the size, it drug on and on and on. Getting to the end was a relief, I doubt I'll read another book by this author."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I don't know why this book had such bad reviews. From the first page of this book to the very last this book kept me interested, awake, and well-immersed in the Tudor courts. I may only be in middle schoolbut I have read many adult books, mostly historical fiction, and this is one of the best I have ever read. Sure, this may be historically inaccurate at some parts (like the age difference in this book goes Anne is the oldest, then their brother, then Mary when in real life it went Mary, Anne, and their brother) but it is still a good read, a very interesting read, and a very needed record of the forgotten Boleyn girl who bore Henry two children and was his first mistress who established the Boleyns at court. Anne is shown in the light she should be told in this book: power hungry, beautiful, a devoted girl to her closest of friends, and simply someone who wanted to make it in the world but went too high and was brought down. Mary will be sympathized in the book and may seem a little whiny at times but you will be scared, happy, upset, and carefree along with her through all the chapters. I recommend this book to all people from 9th Grade+ because of the adult references and I am sure you will enjoy it no matter how inaccurate it may be and how girly it can be. Can't wait to read Phillipa Gregory's next novel, historical hopefully!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will, after reading--or trying to read--THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL--see at once that they stumbled upon what we once called a \\"dime novel\\"-that pejorative characterizing hack writing, which in our time is seen most often in historical romances-novels peopled with superficial modern characters costumed in period dress. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is such a novel. In our time of computers, the internet and blogs, the dime novel has been given new life through heavy promotion and phony critiques. It's a world where lies flourish, and publications such as \\"Publishers Weekly\\" with their fatuous critiques, become co-conspirators in this deception."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I only have to say this, historical facts can be correct, and still have good or even better fiction. Anya Seton proved that, with Katherine. Fact it seems, as in Elizabeth 1, if studied, is far far more interesting than any fiction made to soup up a book or even film. Philipa Gregory blurs truth and makes it sad, for I rate the book as well as the movie next to nothing.J. Schossow"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thought it was a beautiful piece of HISTORICAL FICTION. Entertaining, and not being completely one sided to one side of history. I will not go into depth about the novel because I will get political. A juicy novel about the Boleyn girls. Anne being the older sibling, and Mary the youngest. A story of sibling riverally and all for a King, and for the pride of Howards/Boleyn family. Mary starts out a child courting the King, and while she has his children, to keep the King entertained Anne is sent in to keep him from going astay from the Howard/Boleyn family. During this whole game of breeding Henry the VIII a son, he is still trying to get a divroce from his first wife so he can marry a fertile woman who isn't royality, but a woman who will give him a son. Mary, becoming the dramtic charchter here, decideds to get away from the royal mess once Anne is in the Kings sight, but escaping the clasps of anything royal is never easy. Thus revealing serveral other secrets. Read up! This is the first novel I have read by P.G, and will continue to look forward to further works!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Much has been written about this turbulent time in English history, the reign of Henry VIII, when the English Court changed course, breaking from the Roman Church in order to dissolve Henry's marriage to Katherine of Aragon, who could not bear a living heir to the throne.The fortunes of the great aristocratic families, who fill the courts and fawn upon the King, are immensely enriched when they gain the King's favor and attention. Comely as a young king, Henry VIII is accustomed to garnering the flattery of the young women who serve as the Queen's attendants. The Boleyn/Howard family holds a prominent position in Henry's court in the early 1520's, as Katherine of Aragon becomes ever more desperate in her need to supply an heir and keep the King's affection.The Howards and Boleyns have many young women available to the court, and when Henry first takes note of Mary Boleyn Carey, she is already married. It is acceptable behavior for the King to tryst with her as a paramour, which would be scandalous if she were not married. Mary's sister, Anne, recently returned from the French Court, is one of the clever minds pushing Mary to prominence. The third Boleyn, George, their brother, is also a pet of the Tudor Court, forming the family triumvirate that is to be part of the intrigue surrounding the eventual dissolution of marriage to Katherine of Aragon that will set a precedent and change history.Eventually Mary is replaced in the King's favor by her sister Anne, and George and Mary are instructed to hold their positions, this time in support of the clever, if unlikable, Anne. For five long years Anne tempts and challenges Henry, until she herself is crowned Queen. Never beloved, Anne's temperament is equal to Henry's and she hasn't the wisdom or patience to turn the other cheek on dalliances as Katherine did. Eventually, Henry tires of Anne's scolding and constant demands, his attention newly captured by the seemingly docile and pure behavior of a simpering Jane Seymour. Anne must live with the precedent she's established, swept aside by the King in his desperate pursuit of another to provide a male heir.Gregory's characters are incisive, the story masterfully told, the plots and counter-plots necessary for political viability fascinating to follow. No less complicated than modern day affairs, the degree of scheming is truly of Machiavellian design. Engaging and thought provoking, Gregory's beautifully crafted novel overflows with intrigue and ambition, with scheming characters who bet everything of the whims of a puerile King. The result is magnificent."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Clearly, I'm in the minority here, and I did only read 112 pages, or the first two chapters.Abominable. Painful in its lack of subtlety or craft.The language of the book does nothing to evoke the 16th century. At one point, the main character practically says \\"Whatever!\\" (I forget her actual comment, and I'm not going to torture myself by turning on my Sony PRS to search for one line in a crummy book.)It should be a good movie. It clearly goes for the gusto with sex and intrigue, but that's all it has: enough to float a movie for 90 minutes, but I've already wasted one afternoon on the book, which is more than it deserves. I enjoy a sexy film as much as the next girl, but I'm not going to spend hours reading this vapid tale."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book may be fine as a fantasy, but I feel it is ridiculous to rewrite actual people's lives and rewrite history just for a buck. Much of this book is a complete fabrication, and I am afraid many will take this book as factual. Now it's a movie so even more people can be misguided."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The book reads like it was written for a fifth grade reading level. If this doesn't bother you, then maybe the immature character development will. The characters are all so wooden. Anne is the conniving, overly ambitious coquette and her sister Mary is the unwilling courtier who longs for the country. To the author: I get it already! How many more pages are you going to repeat this theme? Dialogue and plot are so repetitive and there is virtually no character development. I was just looking for an entertaining historical fiction piece written with some sophistication for adult readers. If you're really desperate, stuck in a hotel room on your vacation, then this book may do."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of those books which I felt started off really badly - and so any other brilliance in it was very much marred by the bad start. I found the first part which is a description of an execution rather curious - although it is clearly written to shadow a scene at the end of the book - but Mary Boleyn - the narrator of the story is watching an execution and waiting for Henry to commute the sentence...which she apparently believes he will. I cannot recall a single instance where in the middle of an execution he did this - there may well be but they certainly don't seem to be well documented. So right at the start I was a bit nonplussed.In the very next chapter Mary describes herself as 'the youngest Boleyn girl&quot; who is waiting for her sister Anne to return from France. Now this is patently wrong. Mary was the eldest girl - she went to France first in the retinue of Henry VIII's sister who married the King of France. Anne Boleyn, her younger sister, followed later. Francois, the king of France even described Mary Boleyn as the most promiscuous woman at the French court - and this was at a time when the French court was highly promiscuous.After that I found myself very much at odds with much of the material in the book - I found it hard to enjoy what was patently a plot device (making Mary the younger sister) to try to build up some kind of rivalry between the two sisters over Henry's affections.There was a great deal that was well written and an interesting interpretation of what very little material there is on the Boleyn life at court (of any of the family) and one of the most memorable instances is when Anne and Mary are talking together and I think it is Anne who points out that they are valueless really except that they are interchangeable by their family who wish to get on at court and thus will throw either one or the other under the eye of the King to try to get preference. There is also a great deal about the rivalry between the Somerset family and the Howard's (Anne and Mary's mother was a Howard) and the changing fortunes of each family as they managed to get their profferred female into Henry's bed.Interesting but disappointing at the same time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My first thought while reading this book was to wonder what the author has against Anne Boleyn. It appears to be quite a lot. It also raised an intriguing question. Does the author have this poor a relationship with her own sister? She must,if she has one, or she would not refer to all such relationships as competative and resentment driven, which is the main of several hammers she continually hits the reader over the head with.Historically it takes all the wildest accusations of a suspicious and superstitious era toward a woman whose demise was determinedly orchestrated for political purposes, and uses them as the \\"facts\\" upon which the story revolves. I was very disappointed in that, and the continual harping of the \\"other Boleyn girl\\" Mary about the hate (her word, frequently used) she felt toward her sister. The scene when Anne is due to arrive, (after Mary has fervently wished her to drown in passage) when Mary throws herself into Anne's arms in joyous welcome, is just one example of the discordant elements in these relationships which never become defined and never make any sense.There are endless inaccuracies and a deliberate disregarding of those few things that are known for certain. Much of the information is still being argued by true historians.It has never been clear for example, which was eldest and no, everyone does not agree that Mary was the eldest herself. That argument continues. I don't have a problem with an author making a suggestion of her own, it can make for interesting contemplation, but not to the degree of sensationalism achieved here. I don't believe there one lurid possibility she didn't include. It becomes just another trashy novel.And that cute little piece When Mary as a girl, witnesses an execution, with all its heavy handed, and punishingly obvious portents and symbolism, is the first hammer alongside the headAll I can say further is \\"I'm sorry Anne, for both of us, but at least you didn't have to read the thing. Heaven knows why I did.\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This well-known author of historical fiction has outdone herself with this rich and absorbing tale of the notorious Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary. The Tudor court, with all its pomp and intrigue, is seen through the eyes of the beautiful Mary Boleyn, who at the age of fourteen arrives at court and becomes lady-in-waiting to Katherine of Aragon, Queen of England and wife to King Henry VIII. Although already married to courtier William Carey, Mary captures the heart of King Henry VIII, whose roving eyes land on this innocent young miss.In the eyes of the grasping and greedy Boleyn family, Mary is but the fatted calf through whom their ambitions, they believe, will become realized. So, they offer her up as a sacrifice to their ruthless ambition. Forced to separate from her husband in order to become the King's mistress, Mary betrays the Queen and becomes mistress to the King, all at the behest of her family. Every step of her affair is choreographed from the wings by her family, with the adept aid of her sly and clever sister, Anne, in the role of chief manipulator.Mary struggles with her own code of honor and personal morality, which is often in conflict with what is mandated by her family. Still, despite her best intentions, Mary disappoints them, as her nature is not the kind that takes well to intrigue and manipulation. She the temerity to have sincere feelings of affection for the King, as well as for the Queen. After bearing the King two children, however, she is set aside by a formidable rival, her own sister, Anne, in whom the Boleyn family now place their hopes and ambitions.This is, first and foremost, the story of Mary Boleyn, a woman who has generally been reduced to a footnote in history. It is notable, however, that she was the only Boleyn sibling to survive the purges of the Tudor court and who, ultimately, married for love in an age when this was not the norm among those of her class. It is also the story of Anne Boleyn, her rise and fall, as seen through the eyes of her sister, Mary, with whom Anne was to have a lifelong rivalry.To a lesser degree, it is also the story of their brother, George, a more remote, though no less interesting, personage. His interjection into the story is necessary, as the author attempts to address the issue of incest that arose at the trial of George and Anne Boleyn. She gives quite an interesting perspective on the issue, weaving it, part and parcel, into the story in an effort to explain his downfall, as well his betrayal by his own wife.Told against the magnificent backdrop of the Tudor Court in all its splendor and majesty, the author weaves a complex tale of greed, ambition, sex, and political machination, as well as unparalleled intrigue, in sixteenth century England. Filled with well-fleshed characters taken right out of the annals of history, the story is one that is sure to delight all those with a love for well-written historical fiction. In particular, fans of beloved author, Jean Plaidy, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I picked this book up on a whim. I'd never heard of the author, and I normally stick to ones that I like.I am completely blown away. This is the first book in a very long time that I felt I simply MUST sit down and read and find out what happens. It's just amazing.The story follows the lesser known of the Boleyn sisters, Mary. Her early years at court, her romance with the king, her marriage, and her tumultuous love/hate relationship with her sister Anne are all incredibly detailed. The author wants you to love and hate Anne at the same time, and Mary as well, and somehow you do. You get to watch first-hand as Anne battles her way past her sister's star at Henry's court only to supplant her, and later fall (as history tells). Only we see it all from Anne's sister's point of view -- a naive, innocent, well meaning girl that hates herself for betraying those that she loves for the betterment of her all-consuming family.Characterization will make or break a book more often than not. I found that 'The Other Boleyn Girl' was wonderfully written, and the characters rich and complex. Mary is simple, but she has layers of duplicity about her, and you can't help but admire her when she discovers her backbone. Anne is her foil, and you hate her at the same time that you admire her tenacity and fire. You even understand the (frequently) caricatured figures of Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon, and Jane Seymour. On a perspective note, this book is written in first person -- Mary's story -- yet the telling is so rich and watchful that it doesn't hamper the tale one bit.I really loved this book. I'm off to find out what other gems Philippa Gregory has written lately. If they are HALF as good as this book, I will be utterly pleased."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am in my final year of graduate school, about to receive my Master's in History. I bought \\"TOBG\\" in an airport in Minnesota, en route to California, hoping for a good vacation book. And sadly, that's all it is. If you're looking for anything serious about the Tudor Era, this is NOT IT. I read this book like one would read the National Enquirer -- scandalized and titillated, intrigued and entertained -- but NOT historically fulfilled. This book is seriously a little bit of minor research into the lives of the Boleyns and the Tudors, and then a huge slog of rumors about Anne Boleyn propegated as truth. What honest history Ms. Gregory leaves in is random and awkward (such as the mention of Anne's dog, Purkoy, which was haphazardly thrown in towards the end, after he was long dead -- only someone who truly had read up on their Tudor history would recognize and understand such an obscure reference). Her writing style is a tad awkward as well. Enjoyable, but awkward.What saddens me is this latest rash of interest in King Henry VIII and his court, probably spawned by this and the TV show, \\"The Tudors.\\" People who read Gregory in the hopes of learning more about the era are going to find themselves sadly bereft of any real historical knowledge. If you are really interested in reading about Anne Boleyn, pick up \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" by Alison Weir. Don't be daunted by the length -- it's a really good read, with a lot of factual information. Read Gregory like you would read a tabloid -- for entertainment, without believing a word of it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm glad so many readers appreciate this book's terrific pacing and riveting narrative. Anne Boleyn's rise and fall is one of the great, intriguing stories of English history, and Philippa Gregory does it ample justice. An extra spin and spice is gained by viewing events through the eyes of Mary, Anne's sister and predecessor in sexual intrigue with Henry VIII.Gregory's portrayal of life in an ambitious, rapacious family is vivid and chilling. Mary Boleyn is ambivalent about the costs of her family's high ambition but absolutely vulnerable to its every demand. It says much about Gregory's persuasiveness as a storyteller that Mary remains a sympathetic figure even as she participates in schemes that run counter to her own conscience.Regarding the assertions that Gregory gets her historical facts wrong, it should be noted that recent scholarship does indeed place Anne as the elder sister and Mary the younger (the birth order used by Gregory).There is no contemporary record as to when either Boleyn girl was born. However, the family's decision to send Anne -- not Mary -- to be educated abroad at the court of Margaret, regent of the Netherlands, is cited by recent biographers as important evidence that Anne must have been the elder sister: \\"By contemporary custom, the younger child would not have been favored with such a splendid opportunity to the detriment of her older sister...\\" (Anne later spent additional time abroad at the court of France.)Mary Boleyn was the first sister married, something that would normally indicate she was the elder sister. But Anne was still abroad at the time, and her family may have been hoping for a more splendid match for her with a European nobleman. There is also evidence that the Boleyns were trying (ultimately without success) to betroth Anne to the heir of the earl of Ormond. Both circumstances would explain why they were willing to defer the marriage of an elder daughter and go ahead with an advantageous, though not as splendid, union for their younger girl. These observations come from Retha Warnicke's scholarly study of Anne's life, which Gregory cites as one of her major sources.Sorry if I made eyes glaze over with all this, but it really is unfair to assert that Gregory (whose books are in general distinguished by careful craftmanship) fouled up her facts or distorted them for the sake of a better story. She definitely makes artful conjectures -- impossible to avoid with subjects of whom very few hard facts are known. But her conjectures fall within a solid historical framework.If you enjoyed Gregory's fluid, page-turning touch in this book, take a look at some of her other historical fiction, such as her \\"Wideacre\\" trilogy."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't stand this book. Not only does it completely butcher history, it maligns Anne and makes her sister Mary look like a saint (when in fact she had also been a mistress to King Francis of France before coming to Eng. Court). *SPOILERS*: Gregory writes as if the accusations brought up against Anne (adultery, incest and witchcraft) are true (any historian will tell you Henry just wanted to make way for a new wife to bear him sons). *END SPOILERS* Throughout the book I felt that she was really shoving down my throat that \\"this is definitely a good person\\" and \\"this is definitely a bad person.\\" The characters are always very black/white and sinner/saint, ridiculously sweet/innocent and ridiculously conniving/evil (instead of letting each character have their own positives and negatives). No char development or depth. PG tells you who to like instead of letting you decide for yourself.I think I would actually be able to tolerate/overlook (some of) the inaccuracies if the characters were actually developed and realistic, each having good points as well as flaws instead of them being just \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\"The majority of other authors will either (A) stick to the facts and actual events and create their characters and stories AROUND that. Or (b) it will be a completely made up story, set in a certain period with accurate detail as to daily life/events for that period. Or (c) there will be a few actual historical characters around which the story is set, but the story itself is complete fiction (ex Girl With A Pearl Earring). With b and c, the authors flat out tell you the story is fiction. With a, the authors usually write a note if they have left out/ignored a fact, purposely changed something in the story, or whether there are several theories as to what happened (and why they chose to go with whatever reason they ended up writing).The problem is that Philippa Gregory acts like she's writing A, claims she \\"sticks to the facts\\" when she actually ignores the majority of facts and instead of writing her books AROUND them, she writes OVER them (basically she's trying to re-write history). It's extremely frustrating to people who study history, are historians or people who just plain old really enjoy history that this author INSISTS that all of her books are based on fact. In reality she completely ignores the majority of the facts, making her books mere skeletons of history - names, dates, marriages, births and deaths are correct (well, maybe not birthdates in this book, but you get my point), but other than that don't count on the rest of it. In some cases PG even makes up facts (she claims that she's SURE Anne Boleyn is guilty of at least one murder/poisoning, but offers no proof, and I don't think any of today's historians would agree that Anne was a murderer. In fact Historians tend to distance themselves from PG books and PG herself because they don't want to be related to what is clearly utterly false). And Ms. Gregory breaks the first rule of historical research, which is to USE PRIMARY RESOURCES. When she actually does reference sources, they are secondary and usually have not stood up to the test of time or academic debate. If PG admitted that she was changing historical facts to suit her stories, I think people would be more accepting, but unfortunately she claims her books are all Fact based and makes no notes in the text of the actual facts."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Okay. There are a multitude of things that struck sour with this book. I have to wonder why Philipa Gregory seems out to get Anne Boleyn; so determined to paint this ambitious, intellegent woman as a sexually predatory harpy. What was I supposed to take from this book? Wanting power is bad? Marry a country man and have lots of babies?But I wouldn't have minded that if the book had been well-written. Gregory is entitled to espouse whatever philosophy about history she chooses, and of course she can play fast and loose with the facts, as it's fiction. But the book was slow and too long (and keep in mind, I adore long books), and man, was her characterization all over the place. Mary Boleyn varies between painting herself as a sexually innocent bystander and a knowledgable schemer, vying for the reader's sympathy while at the same time betraying her own sister's trust. She spends half the book longing for a simple country life, but when it's offered to her, demures she couldn't possibly lower herself like that. It's hard to get into a novel where the main character is so unlikable -- and on the other side of the fence, Anne doesn't develop AT ALL as a character. Oh, everyone in the book makes lots of references to the change in her personality, but such does not for character growth make. She begins the book as a conniving witch, she ends the book as a conniving witch who happens to be a dead queen.Which leads to my greatest complaint.Ms. Gregory -- please, for the love of God, grab the nearest dictionary and look up the word \\"subtlety.\\"If you studied even ONE of Shakespeare's plays in school you know that Anne Boleyn, mother of Queen Elizabeth I, was imprisoned in the Tower and then executed after only a few years of marriage to Henry VIII. So I do not understand Gregory's constant need to HINT AT IT. Reading this book is the literary equivalent of dodging anvils. From the first chapter (and it's a long book, people), Anne is saying things like:\\"Do [such and such]? I would rather lay my head on the block!\\"Ka-BOOM!\\"This room makes me feel as if I were locked in the Tower!\\"Ke-RUNCH!\\"I would lay down my life to capture the king.\\"Ka-POW!And it doesn't stop there. With every page characters discussed the hardship of choosing between sisters, what the Bible says about bedding one sister and marrying the other, etc, etc. I wanted to shout, \\"I get it! I get it!\\"Which is not to say the book is a total waste of time. The historical events were interesting on their own, and it was a lot of fun to read about Gregory's conception of court life. But overall, reading it made my brain feel bruised."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a light read -- two dimensional characters and a heavy dose of anachronism -- and it's easy to get sucked into believing this is &quot;as it was.&quot; But this is NOT an accurate portrayal of Anne Boleyn. In fact, I couldn't help but feel a little depressed at how such an educated, passionate, courageous, ahead-of-her-time woman was treated in this novel. Gregory's portrait is of little more than a pathological sadist bent on achieving her goals at all costs. Talk about subtle characterization -- the author practically slaps you in the face every other page with the sibling rivalry theme! Anyone wishing to learn the truth about Anne after should check out Eric Ive's biography -- and in the meantime take this for what it is: Fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence, the first love quickly disillusioned, jealousy, backbiting, a second romance that proves to be the reason for living--yes, we will someday see some actress playing Mary Boleyn on the Lifetime channel in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" That's all this novel is fit for. Mary Boleyn is the most bovine \\"heroine\\" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level. The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL \\" IS A PAGE TURNER IF I EVER MET ONE.

Just read one bit at the bookstore and I promise you won't be disappointed!It is well written, creative, and NEVER a dull moment in the life of the court!

It will be interesting to see how the movie holds up against the book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"Mary and Anne\\" or \\"The Boleyn Sisters\\" might have been a better title for this book. It is a very good book as long as the reader keeps in mind that it is a blend of fact and fiction. Mary was not one of Queen Katherine's ladies-in-waiting.

Will be buying other titles from this author.seller shipped quickly and the book was like new!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"but I loved this book. I could not get enough of it.

Definitely one of my new favorites!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It seems most housewives liked this poorly written book. I did not! If you liked it, I'm sure you'll like Harem, another work of hysterical (\\"historical\\") fiction. Serious readers beware!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had a wonderful time reading this book! Gregory makes the characters come alive! What a talented writer. I'm not a history buff, but once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I googled online after reading this book and found her book to be pretty much in line with the historical records. The important thing to remember, however, is that this is a novel and NOT a documentary. It's not easy making history interesting, but Gregory makes you feel as if you were right there. If you are going on a long plane ride, take this book with you."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"In the same vein as &quot;Girl With The Pearl Earring&quot;, this novel tells a woman's story, a woman whose family was on the losing side of history, at that. And since most all history is written by men -- the men who are the victors -- I found it fresh, gripping and entertaining to imagine Mary Boleyn's life.As often the best cinema does not distract the viewer with special effects or other cinematic devices, so it is with Ms. Gregory's seamless writing. Her words are so well woven I almost forgot that I was reading fiction. I almost forgot that I was reading altogether, I was so transported. A reader cannot do much better!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really liked the book, it was easy to read, and had some interesting details of life in the English Court."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Once I opened the first page, my life started to revolve around this book. I stopped watching TV altogether because it was so riveting. I have read very few historical fiction pieces, but after this, I will read many more. Beautifully written and wonderfully informative about the era and the way people lived at the King's Court. Incredible inside look into the lives of these prominent people."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Everyone knows the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, but this book brings these characters to life & puts a whole new perspective on this age old tale. Mary Boleyn, like her sister Anne and brother George, has spent virtually her entire life in the Royal Court, and the siblings are well educated on how to mask their inner emotions and desires with a courtiere's smile. Dominated by an ambitious uncle, they are each directed to play roles that will advance the family's status. After Mary's relatively brief affair with King Henry VIII, she is supplanted by her sister Anne, and Mary is reunited with the husband she had been married to, but separated from, since she was 12 years old. After his sudden death from disease, she meets and falls in love with a man of whom her family would never approve. Eventually, as things slowly start to disintegrate for her sister Anne, Mary finally finds the courage to separate herself from her family and leave the royal court behind to join the man she has married for love. I love reading a good historical novel, and this book was no exception. Philippa Gregory does a fantastic job of developing characters, setting, and plot to keep the reader engaged from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Bought this at the airport, expecting it to be difficult to get into. I could not put this book down! While it covers a period in history I don't remember as well as I should, the story takes over so that no effort is required to digest the history with the fab story. Recommend!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This has to be one of the most wonderful, well-written books I have ever read. The way it's put together just grabs you and pulls you into the action of King Henry's court. I would recommend this book to ANYONE, but more so to someone who is interested in finding a refreshingly innovative way to look at history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the Boleyn-family to get close to the throne at the times of Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn is ordered by her family to be at King Henry's command whatever his wishes and whims. She obeys her family, since she is barely 13 when first presented to the king. She succeeds in keeping him at her side for a while, until his eyes begin to wander again and he seeks fulfilment (in every way) elsewhere. All of a sudden she is commanded to stand back and let her sister Anne bathe in the king's glory. In my opionion Mary was quite helpless, whereas her sister Anne is portrayed as a scheming whore. The author has a fabulous way with words and if you are interested in English history written at a wonderful pace as well as a thrilling account(in other words: you will probably be utterly, competely, totally unable to put this book down, once you have started) this is a book you simply cannot miss!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a fantastic book. I read many books about Queen Elizabeth when I was younger, but never knew that much about Anne Boleyn. Though I originally bought this book to learn more about the history preceding Elizabeth I, I learned so much more about what life was like for women in the 1500s, specifically those in court. All I can say is - we should be thankful that our lives as women have changed so much. They may have had fancy clothes and jewels and lived in one of the most envied times and places in society, but all they really did was worry about their positions, do what men told them, and think about pregnancies all the time - it's so wonder so many miscarriages occurred when they were so worried and sad all the time! There was no happiness there. It's really quite sad. Anyway, this was a very eye-opening read and very engrossing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found this book very inetresting, hard to put down, and it's characters so intense that I could see them in my dreams. This book is also an excellent history tutor for people like me who never developed an interest for it, now I did and I'm looking forward for the next novel by Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously and had a hard time putting it down! I didn't want it to end! I got a wonderful and informative history lesson as well as a delightfully narrated story. I can't wait to read more about the Tudor time period and Anne Boleyn. And I especially can't wait to read more books by Philippa Gregory! I definitely recommend this book: easy reading (the 600+ pages flew by) and a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I started working nights this winter at a psych unit and found myself without a book one night. My roommate's aunt gave her this book and she hadn't made it past the first chapter, so she let me borrow it. I haven't been able to put it down. I am surprised at how detailed and extensive it is without seeming drawn out or slow moving. Even readers not particularly interested in the time frame of this book will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era, history and nuances of court life and brings to life how it affects each character."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Prior to this book I had never read anything by this author, and I am not usually one who reads historical novels; however, this was excellent. A local book club here chose this book, so I was \\"forced\\" into the reading and glad of it. Once I started, I could not put the book down. Historical accounts and background seem accurate and the lives and actions of the characters are highly believable. Wonderful pacing and characterization."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I'm really into history and this gave me an insight into a period of English history I never really paid attention to before.As to the book. I had no idea that Anne Boleyn even had a brother or sister. History just focuses on her so much you forget that she had a family. Gregory's novel made Anne and her family come to the forefront and kept them there for me. I really looked forward to reading the next chapter and finding out what was going on at court now.It had it's good parts and bad. Mary was a bit simple for me sometimes. Always wishing to see the best in people I felt that had she been a bit more ruthless she would have faired a little bit better against her sister Anne. Of course, as we all know, she's the only one to fair out well at all once everything is said and done. But Gregory does turn this little known sister, into a sort of heroine for meeker and milder people. Mary will never be an Anne, but her personality was able to keep her close to those she needed. And her meekness was also able to give her an insider's outside view of the machinations at court. Something you couldn't get if the story were being told by Anne.Anne, (upon second reading) was really bitchy in this book. I felt Gregory almost demonized her, when other's showed her good and bad side.(I'm referring to Jean Plaidy's novel Lady in the Tower and Showtime's The Tudors.) Anne wasn't all bad, but in this book you'll get more of the bad than anything. She nearly nothing but ambition, pride and selfishness. You almost wonder why Henry even fell in love with her. Until you remember they were really two of a kind. I believe this may have led Anne to her downfall as Henry coudn't suffer anyone to equal, or outdo him.Henry, in this book wasn't as spoiled and obnoxious as I first though. Reading this again I realize that he was coming to terms with his deep, true self. He isn't the Golden Prince he's been led to believe, but he's truly more selfish and unforgiving. I think parts of this realization drove him mad. Even to the point of killing his wife to gain another when he simply could have shut her away.George, I liked. I was sad he died, homosexual or not. He was actually one of my favourite characters. I think I would like to see a book written from his perspective.Katherine, a much better woman than I, or any other woman I know. Gregory's show of her was phenomenal. She showed Katherine with the dignity and grace a queen should have, and the dignity and grace she was bred with. I really admired her character, and the person.The other characters like Jane Parker, who truly turns out to be just as vile as the other characters say; Thomas Boleyn and his wife, the Duke of Norfolk and William Stafford really bring this Tudor novel to life."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For several years, I have picked this book up on many occasions and turned right around and set it back down. Perhaps, I should have stuck with my original inclination and left it on the shelf. It's not bad - and quite entertaining, but draggy. I got mid way through and wondered if I should finish it - deciding that I'd like to see the movie (I'm a sucker for grand period pieces) I pushed through. The historical story itself is vastly interesting. I'm not enough of an English scholar to sift fact from fiction, but I image the bones of history are intact. In general, Gregory's language does not seem authentic - perhaps her publishers wanted a lightened up version for mass market/general consumption - - I understand how that could happen. I suppose it's a story that we know the ending, so it seems like it takes a long time to get there - - Looking forward to the costumes and elaborate set designs."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I can't describe how much I loved this book. Even knowing from history how it would end, I could hardly put it down. It was a great love story but even more fascinating to read about life in the 1500's and the games played by the top political families vying for the throne."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you loved the other books by this author you will love this one. A definite page turner. I strongly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"By far the best book of all 20 of her books! Riveting in every way...

I felt like it was fairly historically accurate, however I don't believe both of her children were Henry's and I don't think there was even much dispute about that."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you are a fan of historical fiction, you will love this book. Lots of intrigue, deceit and lust! I loved every minute of this novel!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"First I have to say that in school and college, I either skipped or slept through most of my history classes. It was my least favourite subject. That being said...Several people recommended this book, and when I finally picked it up, I was imediately roped in. I read it in two days, and went out to buy the rest of this series!Not only was the book fascinating,and steamy, but it's also real history folks! I learned so much from \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and what life was like in that era.Life in the King's court was truly scandelous, and a queen's life was under constant scrutiny. Nothing was kept private for these women, and their sole purpose in life was to get pregnant and bear sons. When Anne finds herself unable to become pregnant again by Henry (the ol' guy seemed to have an issue with impotence), she becomes desperate and resorts to incest, trying to save her neck and give him a son.The Tudor family lived to make the King and Queen happy, despite their own feelings. But their sole purpose in the royal court was to climb their way to the top, and win the King's favour. They used any means necessary, including sacrificing their young daughters. Catherine, the young innocent, was merely a pawn, catching the eye of the king and tearing him away from his queen and holding his lust at bay, while Anne waits cunningly in the wings for her moment strike.Read this book, it has everything: sex, scandal, execution, treason and lots of scheming."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Very different from the movie, however, much more thorough. Book places a much stronger focus on Mary Boleyn."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"After becoming a fan of the Tudors, I couldn't help but become more interested in this period in history. Philippa Gregory tells these stories well and keeps the reader interested!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book; however, I am a mature adult. It should not recommended for Girls 11-13 as Amazon has done."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is probably the most well known of Gregory's historical fiction novels and a movie version did come out a year or so ago. I enjoyed this book because it was entertaining, I felt like the characters had some depth to them so I cared about what happened to them, and it was an interesting story. That being said (as I said with The White Queen), there are loads of historical inaccuracies. This would not bother me so much if Gregory did not present herself as such a wonderful, through, and in depth historian/researcher. The story covers one of the most intriguing times in British history - Henry VIII's need for a son and break with the Catholic Church. Most people know about Anne Boleyn - Henry's second wife that he moved heaven and hell (literally!) to marry. This story is not told from Anne's point of view but from her younger sister Mary's point of view.Mary comes to Henry VIII's court a young, innocent girl who has recently married. She is pretty and catches Henry's eye. Her power hungry and scheming family see this as their ticket to bigger and better things and they pretty much shove Mary into Henry's bed. Mary ends up falling in love with the King and baring him two children. She constantly disappoints her family though as she is not really cut out for the manipulative game they're playing. She also has moral qualms about what she is being made to do which directly contradicts what her family expects from her and she struggles with this throughout the story. Despite her family's ambitions, she feels loyalty to Queen Katherine and constantly apologizes for what she is doing on her family's bidding. She is eventually set aside in favor of Anne and watches her astounding rise to power and fame as an unwitting accomplice., knowing that she will forever be in her sister's shadow. Mary takes things into her own hands though and marries a man for love, gaining the animosity of her sister who banishes her from Court. In the country she learns the life of a country wife and realizes she would much prefer it to life at Court. That life catches up to her and she has to return to help Anne through miscarriages and Henry's quickly declining favor. Mary is able to avoid the arrest, imprisonment, and eventual execution that awaits Anne and their brother George.This is an intriguing and entertaining story to read. It has everything that keeps most readers occupied - love, hate, sex, betrayal, greed, backstabbing, political intrigue, etc. It is NOT, however, the wonderful piece of HISTORICAL fiction that it is promoted as being. There are just way too many historical inaccuracies. Mary, for instance, by most accounts was the older sister though the sisters' exact birth dates are uncertain. Anne, while I do believe she was a very intelligent, shrewd person, I do NOT believe she was the horrible person Gregory portrays her as in this novel. There is also no proof of George's sexual preferences or the possible incest between him and Anne. In fact, the charge of incest between the siblings was most likely concocted by Cromwell and others in order to further damn Anne at her trial. These are just some of the bigger issues with the book (there are a lot of other smaller, more nit-picky points though). I have no problem with Gregory including these things in her story if that is her interpretation of history but she should not be trying to insist that this is absolutely what happened.The characters in the story are interesting enough for me to care about. I feel sorry for Mary through much of the story because of the way her family treats her. At times I really do not like Anne and at others I can pity her (especially towards the end). Henry really comes across like a selfish little boy and I don't particularly like him either. Queen Katherine is a likable figure (must more so than in the Gregory story about her, The Constant Princess) and I do have to feel sorry for her on occasion.Overall it is a good read and one that I think most people will enjoy if they don't care about the historical aspect too much. This book has really brought historical fiction to the forefront again and I am extremely grateful to Gregory for this."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was full of drama and plenty of backstabbing. I found Anne and Mary's relationship to be the most interesting. These two sisters both hated and loved each other. I though George, the Boleyn brother, was another very interesting character. I found this book hard to put down and it kept me up late at night reading. I enjoyed every minute of this one and highly recommend it. But before reading this one, I do suggest reading Philippa Gregory's The Constant Princess which is about the Princess of Spain who later becomes Henry's wife. It's not necessary to read that one first, but I think it's nice to get the storyline behind Henry and Queen Katherine's marriage.The writing in The Other Boleyn Girl was great, the plot fantastic and the characters are well written. The story is narrated by Mary and you can't help but feel bad for her, she is thrown into a life of lies and deceit at an early age. You also wonder how she continues to put up with Anne and be loyal to her. I liked the dialouge between the three Boleyns; Anne, Mary and George. Just when you think the plot can't thicken, it does."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thought this was a great book. It held my interest from beginning to the very end. It actually left me wanting more! I'm looking for more books on the Boleyn family and Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boelyn Girl is the story of Mary Boelyn, sister of Anne Boelyn, the second wife of Henry VIII of England. This novel describes Mary's journey from an obedient Howard Girl into an independent woman.I really loved this novel. The mixture of romance, ambition, and betrayal kept me interested from the very beginning. The Other Boelyn Girl is a very quick paced book. If you miss just one paragraph, you may miss a crucial part of the story. This ensures that there is never a dull moment in this novel.The characters, especially Mary and Anne, have so much depth. I really felt like I knew the characters every emotion. Although they are all not easy to like (not all are meant to be liked), Gregory made each character captivating, making the book near impossible to put down.Gregory's portrayal of King Henry VIII through Mary's eyes was magnificent. At first, she thought of him as a beautiful God, perfect in every way. As she matured so did her perception of the powerful King. She began to view him as he really was behind all the masks he loved to wear.I have read other novels by Phillipa Gregory, and I can say, without a doubt, that this is her greatest novels. Although I found many of the others somewhat dry and boring at times, The Other Boelyn Girl is both captivating and intriguing with the ability to hold a readers attention from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have enjoyed some of Gregory's other books, and found this one good as well. Even though you know Anne is doomed from the start, it is hard to put down. Although I realize there are some fictional liberties taken, I learned some things I never knew about the period and the history of the Bolyens."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Not only is this a great book, but I was intrigued by the author's use of Mary (Anne's sister) as the narrator. I love reading historical books about King Henry VIII and his court, and have never before seen a book written from the perspective of Mary Boleyn."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm over half way with this book. I saw the movie first which is always a mistake. But it still proves true the book is still better than the film. The book is totally opposite of the film in fact. This author puts a little of everything in here, Love, heartache, jealousy, sex, treason....I like how the author takes me back in time, I feel like I'm walking there beside the Boleyn's. It seems kind of complicated at times of who's trying to win who, but that's all the fun trying to keep up, right? Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I first fell in love with this book several years ago and actually keep it as my fall-back re-read at least once a year. The movie in no way did the book justice."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Well written, though not always historically correct. Plunges the reader into the intrigues of the Tudor court.Characters are well developed"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is #2 in the Tudor Court series, taking place in 16th century England. Mary Boleyn has fallen in love with King Henry VIII after much prompting by her family to leave her husband and go after the king (for the good of the family.) When things do not work out for her, they prompt her sister, Anne, to try out for queen. We all know how that ended. In this very entertaining version Mary is portrayed as young and naive, while Anne is coniving and ambitious. It is a great read as historical fiction. There is also a movie out on this book, and there are 7 in the Tudor series."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Well written about a very difficult time to be alive. If you please the righ people, your life is ok. Fall out of favor and you're sunk. Good history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"i didn't love the movie but i loved the book. the book is mary's side of the story & from her perspective. way better. i loved this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"First, let me state that I enjoy Philippa Gregory's writing style - she is exceptionally descriptive and I can almost imagine everything as she writes it, which I enjoy. I even felt myself wanting to go into the book and punch Anne in the face myself for some of the things she's done, that's how good and intricate her writing is. That being said, I enjoyed The Kingmaker's Daughter much better.I get that there are what some consider to be \\"historical inaccuracies\\". That may be true but Ms. Gregory doesn't tout the book as a true recount of the history of the period. It's a story and a fairly good one at that. My main problem is with the character, Mary. Without giving too much of the book away, Mary was, in my opinion, a sad little character. I understand that the women of that period were deferential to their men and their king. I get it but Mary seemed to be \\"unfinished\\" for lack of a better word. She was a pawn in the game of her family's grasp for power and basically resented it but did it as her duty. When she was no longer needed to be a big player, she made her own way, carving out a life she could be happy with but never truly letting go of her old life. Perhaps it's my personal thoughts that cloud my judgment of the book in that I am damn glad I was not a woman in that era because I can't imagine cleaving to my husband in every sense of the word. To that end, the final part of the book didn't hold for me as far as Mary was concerned. I ended up liking George and Anne better as characters - they at least lived what they strived for and never apologized. Mary is that person...the 'pleaser' - basically a human doormat. Whether or not that was historically true, I don't know. But for the sake of this book, it kind of dragged the rest of the story down for me."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As usual, I enjoyed this novel by Philippa Gregory. I like the way she writes this series in the first person. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys early British Monarchy history. It is well researched."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book years ago, my first experience with the author. I love everything that Philippa Gregory writes. I bought this copy because it's a signed copy. Woo Hoo!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"So the Other Boleyn Girl is really well written, as soon as you start off the book the details are great and it just draws you in like a hook, Gregory really hit the nail on the head with the story itself, I really liked her little twist on George and his irritation with girls :)Though the historical details are extremely inaccurate, but if you don't mind the historical inaccuracies then this book is for you. This book follows mary Boleyn, by the way, not anne. I got this book due to the fact that I watched the movie and thought it was about Anne, also it shows mary in a much nicer light then what she really was."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book arrived in a a little slower then I thought in fact had kinda forgot I order it, but since I was not in a rush it was not a huge problem. Arrived as said in good shape. Book had no wear,tears or markings."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. I like most of Philippa Gregory's books but this is, by far, my favorite. You really feel like you know every character. She does a good job of making you feel for each of them and see their side of things. A lot of people critizing for historical inaccuracies but this is a historical FICTION book, not everything in it is said to be true. It is loosely based on a true historical event. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A totally fascinating read, very easy book to read & couldn't put it down. Some slight bends of the truth but overall I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a very good book; I truly enjoyed reading it and learned a lot about that Period. I love my Kindle and recommend the book and the Kindle for other readers."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a passionate, exciting story that introduces a new world in the court of King Henry VIII and the triumph of Anne Boleyn (his second wife) as she is driven to success by her unending drive, which eventually leads to a sticky end for her whole family. This book has you rooting, plotting and celebrating while always wondering what the next twist will be."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was looking for a book that I couldn't put down... This was the book! What a great story. I found it very hard after reading the Outlander series to get into another book. This book was the answer!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a real page turner, I have read it three times. I cannot believe this is a true story, how did the king let all this happen!?! I like most everything by Phillippa Gregory, but this is the only one I will recommend to everyone. Do not base your opinion on the movie, that movie we not very good in comparison to the book"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really enjoyed this audio. I had first come across the book and was having trouble reading it because of time constraints. It was my first history reading of King Henry the VII. I really loved the authors style and the person reading it made the story come to life. I was most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I can't say much except that this is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down. I can read it over again and again and feel like I'm actually living during this time period and understand the author trying to captivate my emotions. It's a truly brilliant novel. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory brings the Tudor Court alive in The Other Boleyn Girl. Very well researched, she sprinkles the text with little details about fashion, buildings and even flowers that take you back to the 16th century."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I didn't expect this book to be so well written and clever! This and The Boleyn Inheritance are the two most enjoyable historical fiction novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Don't go for the movie version, read the real one! It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Am looking forward to reading another of Ms. Gregory's good historical novels. She does in-depth research on the history of the times and gives exciting details on the characters, real and fictitional."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Okay, so while you may not use this novel as a reference while writing a paper on English history, if you need a book that will keep you enthralled you have most certainly found it.The Boelyn family wants nothing more than to elevate themselves within the English social hierarchy. As players in the court of Henry VIII from a very young age, siblings Anne, George and Mary know how to play the game well. When young Mary catches the eye of the King while at court, the family, under the guidance of their ruthless uncle, meet to determine how to best use Mary to further the family's social agenda. What follows is a thrilling tale of love, murder, betrayal and sibling rivalry. Descriptions of the English court and the actions within will keep readers immersed and interested. The horrific exploitation of women and children and the social acceptance of it all is both riveting and nauseating. An excellent piece of historical fiction, not to be missed.DYB"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was an interesting novel about a time period that I enjoy to read about. It is fluffier than some other great authors who have touched on the period. The story was nicely woven with artistic license and entertaining.There were parts that droned on... and parts that surprisingly wrapped up quickly. It was a good read, but your expectations of the author and historical time period may sway you to LOVE the novel or ABHOR the style.Keep in mind that it is historical fiction and it is a good read. And if this is the first you've read of the era... keep reading.I really enjoyed Eleanor of Aquitaine by Weir- a more serious style."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have always been a big fan of English history so I immediately saw the movie based upon the book. Always wanting to find out more I bought the book myself and from the first page I was hypnotized. The characters are so vividly brought alive that I felt their fear, joy, love, and pain. I grieved with Mary and felt her sorrow for the death of her brother and sister regardless of the acts they did to get to the \\"chopping block\\". I am pleased to read the book from Mary's point of view; despite her being the \\"loser\\" you can't help but to cheer for her every step of the way. This is the first time I have been introduced to Philippa Gregory, and I am looking forward reading her other historical fiction novels!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really loved this book but it was so slow and for someone who doesn't have a lot of patience, I gave up a little more than half-way through. Everything about it I loved, except the slowness of how things happened. I saw the movie last week and thought it really entertaining."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Couldn't keep my interest. I love historical books but it seemed too long for me."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The facts were horribly skewed, Anne's character was evil, Mary was dumb, and there was lots of soap opera drama, but I don't care because I loved it! I loved that Anne was a scheming shrew, George was gay, and that they allegedly had an incestuous child that died in utero, but most of all I love that it was such a fun story to read. It was almost trailer trash, but so unabashed in it's telling that you've got to admit that Gregory has balls. As for the fact that it wasn't true to fact...who cares? It's a story and a great one at that!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm halfway through but it's a great historical novel, potraying a realistic image of court life."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This isn't the deepest book I've read, but it certainly filled the hours while I was lying in bed sick for days. The story line might be compared to that of a soap opera in parts, but it actually got me thinking quite deeply about the plight of women, even those who were considered upper class, in earlier times. The book offers a fascinating perspective on the difficult choices - some horrifying by today's standards - women may have been forced to make in order to retain a place in their family and society."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A very enjoyable book. It spans the years 1521-1536 and brings to light the high handedness of King Henry VIII as well as the plight of women. The sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn and their brother George are front and centre in this story serving up a brew of corruption, rivalry, greed and incest.Servants were used to accentuate the feelings of importance in the upper classes, where everyone aspired to be. Cruelty to animals was common - bear baiting was among the king's favorite past times.The plague was rampant at that period and to escape it King Henry would take off to the countryside away from the crowds of beggars and supplicants.Interesting to note that at age 45, he was fat and aging with a stinking wound on his leg, thwarted by what he most desired - a male heir to succeed him.Has society improved much since that period? I sure hope so."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"First off, I'm not a history buff. As much as I enjoy studying many subjects, I've never enjoyed studying history. And I've rarely read historical fiction. Yet on the recommendation of a friend, I picked this one up. I could hardly put it down. Told through the voice of Mary, \\"the other Boleyn girl,\\" this story is a fictionalized interpretation of the story of Mary & Anne Boleyn during the time of their involvement in the court of Henry VIII. I found the storytelling to be enthralling, and the descriptions of the splendor and at times viciousness of the English court to be intriguing. And I may have even picked up a little history along the way. Other reviews I've read here state that there are a number of historical inaccuracies in this book. I'll take their word on that. However, this book has not only entertained me, but has also piqued my interest. I now find myself wanting to find a good nonfiction account of this historical period."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a good bit of fluffy renaissance fiction using historical characters and events to give it a sense of 'realness'. However, potential readers must remember that this is a work of fiction. Some of the ideas and situations presented in the book at one time were theories as to what really happened in the lives of the Boleyns and King Henry VIII and most of those theories have long since been discredited.This book fills in some of the gray areas of history with \\"what might have happened\\", though the outcome is still as history tells us without a doubt (let's face it, you really can't have Anne Boleyn still alive at the end of the book as we all know she parted ways with her head).A few characters in the book do not stay true to contemporary reports of their true-life counterparts and others are spot-on. But then, this is fiction and liberties will be taken. Sometimes the characters seem a little too 21st century in their thoughts and actions, which takes away some of the stuffiness of the Renaissance and makes for an easier read, but at the same time detaches the characters too much from their time period. The reader must keep this in mind.Do not read this book if you are expecting historical accuracy. Read it for the good bit of fiction that it is."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a page-turner!!! Kept me up late until I finished it!I'm reading the rest of the books in the series now. They are all very good!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Not since The DaVinci Code have I read such a fantastic book! I couldn't put it down. After the DaVinci Code, I got really interested in symbols and the freemasons. Well, I am totally obsessed with anything Phillipa Gregory and British Royal History. Now, granted, I am an Eastern European History student, so I have a fondness for the basic subject, but hadn't really gotten to interested in Western Europe. I first read Sex With Queens by Eleanor Herman which is a non-fictional account of all the dirty girls who have sat on the thrown. She also has a King edition as well, I just haven't gotten around to that one yet. But back to The Other Boleyn Girl, I like that Ms. Gregory wrote the book in the voice of Mary Boleyn, whom you never hear about. The absolute determination of Anne and her family contrasted by Mary's desire for a simple quiet life is what makes the story so fantastic. I have just started the second Boleyn book, The Boleyn Inheritance, which looks into how the women after Anne where effected by the damage that was done by the Boleyn family, so far, so good."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory is the consummate story teller. A most delightful read - I look forward to reading her other works!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a book that is impossible to put down! It capture you from page one til the last page. Just very well written and exciting! Buy it today!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I wont give away too many spoilers from this book as I think each reader should make their own opinion on it. If you are looking for a truly 100% accurate historical account of the Tudor Era sadly there is no book out there to find. It isnt for lack of trying but there are no longer \\"witnesses\\" to actual events to corroborate or refute anything written. So in my opinion all \\"elizabethan/tudor\\" books are going to have some fiction in it somewhere.I personally enjoyed this book tremendously, more than I thought I would. I have been an Elizabethan Historical Re-enactor for more than 10 year now and as part of our training and education we are all drilled with the fact that accurate historical record keeping was not a fine tuned science. Considering the mindset of the era it would be difficult to be accurate. Henry VIII for example changed his (and England's) laws and religion to suit his desire's and needs this part is historically accurate. Monarchs sadly were very selfish and abused their power in order to justify their \\"sins\\".In this book, Henry VIII is portrayed as an over-bearing, randy man who let his loins run his head while his heart tried to run England. This seems to be somewhat true as most nobility were held higher as they were appointed (in most cases) to their station by a monarch and as monarchs were chosen by God himself to rule. It has never been a mystery or secret that Henry had many mistresses and it was even \\"rumored\\" that he had several illegitimate children by these mistresses. Children that were raised to believe they were the child of the mistresses husband.I was intrigued by the portrayal of him in this book. First and foremost he was the King of England but he was also a man and a man in power can only be as great as his Council. The portrayal of the members of court and the tidbits of information that were placed in his ear would explain some of his irrational actions. The members of the court were vultures and only cared about one thing, how to gain the favor of the king and not caring who they sacraficed or stepped on to get that favor.The other job of the court and nobility was to protect their own so they could remain having it all. Just as easily as they were rewarded they could be stripped of everything in the same breath. They would twist and contort whatever they could in order to protect their king thus protecting their interests and holdings. So planting irrational bugs with the king was doubly beneficial.The Howard Family and the Boleyn Family possibly did offer their girls up for Henry's taking. It was not uncommon to betroth your children by their 1st birthday and have them married by 13-14 years of age. So The Boleyn's turning Mary into the King's paramour would have benefited the family greatly. Mary was young and not so naive being already married but her being curious makes sense. If you look at it as from the time she was a child she was \\"trained\\" to be a doting, devoted wife and mother. In that order, the children came second to the man's needs and female children were only good for marrying to wealthy title holding men. The girls were also taught to obey and never question, the husband was right and never wrong and the wife was never right.Mary was raised to never refuse the requests of the men in her life (her father, her uncle, her husband, her king). She certainly didnt come across as being an innocent in any way, but the guilt she felt must have been real and true for \\"betraying\\" Queen Katherine. Another woman who was raised and taught to never question or refute her husband. They were actually taught and believed that it was a man's nature to have a wife and a mistress. Similarly to the beliefs of some women today are still the same. Thus the reason that cheating seems to be somewhat acceptable.Anne was portrayed as a selfish, shrew who looked down on everyone but the king and herself. This may or may not be accurate, in the past she has been seen as a shy, innocent girl who was used and taken advantage of. This book shows the reverse side of the possibility that she did everything she could to gain and keep her station in life. She possibly didnt care who she hurt to get what she felt she was deserved. It is a twist on what is believed to be true, again sadly no one knows.Witchcraft was very popular in the time whether it was accurate or not. Even if you were known to grow certain herbs and plants you could be accused to witchcraft. If a man took fancy of you as a female and you were not interested and he became what we call infatuated or \\"a stalker\\" then you could be accused of witchcraft simply because you were kind or beautiful. I did not see any \\"proof\\" of witchcraft in this book it was merely insinuated and an accusation that tied in with finding reason to execute Anne.In regards to the \\"monsterous fetus\\" delivered by Anne that has been referred to as the \\"demonic baby\\" this part is possibly inaccurate. As is the insinuated story line behind its conception. But it was not unheard offor a woman to become pregnant by another man in order to provide a male heir to her husband. The story line that it was her brother's child is what I believe is purely fiction but it ties into the accusations that Anne and George were executed for so made for a great twist in the historical fiction story line. Miscarriages were common and a deformed baby could be nothing more than an under developed fetus. In an era of the fear of witchcraft, a deformity was deemed as proof of cohorting with evil and satan.The hint and out right blatant homosexual undertones that were leveled at many of the men in court is also possibly inaccurate. However I personally found the possiblity as being literary genious. Its not as if male/male and female/female relationships werent around in that period of history. It simply was totally taboo and kept very hush hush. Society in the time was not as accepting and forgiving as today's society is therefore it would make sense that even nobles had skeletons in their closets that were only known in small groups of well trusted circles. In fact homosexuality can be found as far back in history as the Bible, look at Sodom and Gomorrah.It was also true for the time that a man and woman could not be married without the approval of the fathers and in some cases especially those of nobility had to be approved what every monarch was on the throne. Many people had secret marriages and were \\"ruined\\" especially if it came into public light.In closing as I stated in my title, if you are in doubt about this book check it out from the library and read it before buying it. Even if you just read part of it and then buy it to finish it is still the same. I personally bought it because I wanted to add it to my collection of historical and historical fiction library. I also had a waitress tell me that it was a worthwhile read and therefore didnt hesitate. I have yet to see the movie yet but am looking forward to seeing it when it comes to dvd."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was not as well written as I was expecting giventhe author's reputation, but she's an excellent storyteller. It startsslowly, but once it hooks you, you'll be unable to put it down. Themain thing I didn't like about it at first was that it read like a15-year-old had written it, and it had the feel of a Sweet Valley Highromance novel at times, but then I remembered that Mary Boleyn wasabout that age when she made her debut at the English court, so itoccurred to me that maybe this was a conscious stylistic choice thatthe author was making, since the story is told first person fromMary's perspective. Once I got into the meat of the story though, Iquickly forgot my criticisms and just got lost in the times, and letthe story envelop me. The bottom line is: Was reading thisnovel an enjoyable experience? I would say absolutely. Would Irecommend it to others? I'm not so sure. Did it make me immediatelywant to log onto Amazon and purchase Philippa Gregory's other works?No, and that was disappointing."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It seems unless I have read some things wrong this book is out of print. Considering it was just made into a wonderful movie. Considering that history is my thing I can be very critical of such books but this one really seemed to touch base. Certainly there were some changes, but in this book, Anne was certainly not a victim. She was the instigator, but it is one of major ironies of history that the great ruler Henry sought turned out to be the best ruler that England ever has known."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a wonderful piece of historical fiction. The author's use of actual events and timetables make the story even better. Such a fascinating character and a beautifully written book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's beautifully written. Gregory finds a great balance of description, not to much not to little. She has this great ability to make the reader feel as he were in that space and time. I also found that the author leaves you with the feeling of \\"wanting to find out more\\" which I find great. I finished this book last night (2am, couldn't stop reading)and first thing in the morning I was at the bookstore looking for more books on the topic. I'm going to start \\"The secret diary of Anne Boleyn\\" , I hope it's as good as this one. Don't miss this great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book has absolutely drawn my complete attention - I just couldn't put it down. The rich description of the English court and life fascinated me and the clever blending of the fiction and history was flawless. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Simply (and often) said, I could not put this book down. This is the first book that I have read by Philippa Gregory and I am very impressed.She has done an excellent job of intricately weaving the characters into a web that becomes too tangled for them to escape. A beautifully orchestrated trainwreck...15 years in the making. That process and the end result, are literary genius.I found myself reading so intently on the subway to work, that I missed my stop...several times. It's that good!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My interest in Tudor history began with the PBS series on Henry and Elizabeth I many years ago. Since then I have read many books on these figures. Although little is actually known about Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister, this book told a very believable story of Mary and her family. It incorporated both rumor and historical fact in such a way that I forgot it wasn't necessarily accurate. A nice departure from the typical books by Weir, etc, which although interesting, don't capture the same feeling of &quot;being there&quot; that this book does."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Sex and intrigue in 16th Century England. What could be better?I work the local Renaissance Faire and have been interested in the Renaissance and Elizabethan period for years. This book brought to life people I had only read about in dry school texts. Ms. Gregory was able to pull me in to the lives of those at court with their gossip, lies, and scandals.Henry VIII and Anne Bolyn seemed made for each other, both so full of ambition--blind ambition. It's amazing the pressure a country and those closest to you can produce when the throne is on the line. I wouldn't want to be them, but to hear their story in this work of fiction based on history was fascinating."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a great read, excellent historical fiction. Rich images, very evocative of the time and place it portrays. If you enjoy historical fiction, English historical fiction in particular, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a great book to pick up if you have a free afternoon, or more likely, a weekend to burn.Definetly a novel to keep you intrigued, the perspective of that of Mary Boleyn is a unique and thought provoking view of the retold to death story of Queen Anne Boleyn's rise and fall.Overall a worthy buy"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I agree with other reviewers, couldn't put it down, wished the bus ride was longer. I disagree with the review who said Jane Parker was vapid--hasn't met someone like that, probably, because she was anything BUT vapid. Well written, exciting, and I, too, am on the quest for other books by this author.It is difficult to find excellent historical fiction and this book more than qualifies. I bought a copy of this to pass around to family members."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Flawlessly and artfully written, I can't say the last time I so enjoyed a book! This book takes you deep into the intrigue of the English court and the story of the Boleyn family's strategic political rise through the bartering of it's daughters to a lecherous, philandering king. Told from the perspective of the less infamous oldest sister, and the king's first Boleyn mistress, Mary; Historical fact is seamlessly blended with fiction in an exciting tale of political intrigue, backstabbing sibling rivalry and one woman's insatiable and unstoppable ambition to be crowned queen. I couldn't put it down!--This isn't the history they taught you in school!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"So many reviews have already been written about this book, that I hesitated before deciding to write one myself. I won't go into the plot as it has already been done by many other reviewers.This is the first book I have ever read of it's type, as normally I am not into British history...all the kings, queens, dukes, earls, etc..But my book club chose this book and so therefore I was more or less forced to read it. Once I got into the book, I found that it got better and better as it went on. I really enjoyed it. I have read some other reviewers state that the author did not get her facts correct. Perhaps this is true, but I found the book so entertaining as a novel , that I didn't care. I guess sometimes ignorance is bliss!If you want a very enjoyable book that you will find harder and harder to put down, I highly recommend The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Mary Boleyn uses her voice to narrate this excellent story about the life of the young wife of King Henry the VIII. It is interesting to read about all the scheming and power plays that went on inside the castle walls. Philippa Gregory is able to capture the essence of what happened during this period by giving Mary a voice to tell her story. Another great historical book is in the same genrue isThe North Kingdom by Jordan N. Danniels. It has many plots and intrigues that twist and turn like a top throughout the book. Like The Other Boleyn Girl-one can see how much corruption is associated with those who wear the crown-and thus have all the power!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a nice read. I'll admit that.However, there are many factual errors in this story, the most memorable being that Anne has suddenly become older than Mary. (In reality, it is believed that MARY was indeed older than Anne.)I would recommend this book for those who are interested more in entertainment than history. Also, for a parental warning there are some fairly... suggestive (and NOT ambigous)... references in this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Very interesting book... I had to keep reminding myself it was historical \\"fiction\\". Everytime I think of Henry the VIII and Anne Boleyn and Queen Elizabeth I will refer to this book (whether the scholars and textbook writers like it or not). Its currently being loaned out to various friends who are all saying the same thing as me... love it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book makes history fun even though the subject is very serious (Anne Boleyn is beheaded). The author very deftly takes actual historical events and real people who lived at the time and links them together like a marvelous braided chain, filling in the gaps we shall never know about and can only speculate between these real people and their real events with causality and human emotion and very human behaviors. The other Boleyn girl is Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne, who was King Henry's mistress before Anne became his wife (this is true, she was a real person). The story is told from Mary's point of view and it gives a detailed picture from Mary's ringside seat as a lady-in-waiting first for Catherine and then for Anne in the court of one of the biggest figures in history, King Henry VIII. It does get a bit \\"romance novelish\\" when the title character meets her future husband (that's why 4 stars and not 5), but otherwise this is a well-written, and quite interesting read that truly makes that period of time alive and vibrant."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For anyone that loves to read books about Henry VIII and his many wives, this is a must read!! Once you begin reading it is difficult to put down! I read the whole book in just a few days! This book comes from a different perspective than other books about this topic--from Anne's sister. Mary's store is an interesting one indeed!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was so much fun to read that my husband was annoyed when I had my nose burried in this book during our drive along beautiful Highway 1 on the California Coast instead of watching the scenery on our recent road trip!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"great read! If you enjoy historical fiction, and have any interest at all in getting behind the scenes of the pomp and venality of the British court in pre-Elizabethan England, then this is a must. The book rounds out some curious aspects of Henry's six marriages not found in most history texts. It gives a sense of the gossip that was the currency of the court, among the men and women - which she of course is imagining - but which provides context and a fuller view of the mores of the time. Also, I had no idea that another Boleyn daughter existed beyond Anne, and never grasped the position her family (the Howards) held at court, or the effects their rivalry with the Seymours had on their choices.

While I was reading it I could think of nothing else. Each day at work I couldn't wait to come home so I could dive right into it. I was completely taken in by Mary Boleyn's character. I had no idea of her association with King Henry VIII and was fascinated with her relationship with Anne and the Boleyn family in general. Philippa Gregory paints such a vivid picture of court life and all the calamities that go with it that I easily felt I was right there watching all of this amazing history unfold. Discovering this book has started me on a reading frenzy of all things King Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory tells the tale of Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary, in her extraordinary novel The Other Boleyn Girl. Mary Boleyn is the narrator of Gregory's novel. The Boleyn family pits sister against sister to further their political aspirations. Mary, who has an affair with King Henry VIII and has two children with him, is eventually pushed aside by her sister Anne. Mary details how Anne overthrows Katherine of Aragon and wins the affections of King Henry.It has been a very long time since I read any historical fiction. I must say that I approached this novel with some trepidation. However, I was most pleasantly surprised. Gregory is an amazing author. She wove intricate detail into the story without bogging it down. It was quick-paced and I honestly had trouble putting the novel down. The characters are well-developed, the plot was intriguing, and Anne was the kind of character that you love to hate. It was wonderful!I will definitely be checking out Gregory's other novels."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Mary Boleyn was \\"presented\\" to Henry VIII by the scheming Boleyn/Howard clan in order to promote their interests. Since she was not devious enough to hold Henry's interest, her sister Anne, the more famous Boleyn, was then thrown in Henry's way. Their story, together with their brother's and the rest of the people too near the throne, makes history come alive and creates enough suspense to hold one's interest all the way through to Anne's terrible end. Of course, it is fiction based on lives, but the dialogue is believable, the characters are well-formed, and court life is accurately depicted."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My book club picked this book and I was not excited about reading anything from that era in history and since it was over 600 pages I figured I would never get it read in time for our meeting. After starting the book I couldn't put it down. I really, really enjoyed it and so did 10 of our 12 members."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is without a doubt the most intresting, vivid, colorful and entertaining piece of historical fiction about the Tudor court that I have ever read. Philippa Gregory is my new favorite fiction author and this book is most definetly my favorite(\\"The Constant Princess\\" is a close second).The novel is narrarated by Mary Boleyn, the younger sister of Anne and often thought of as the forgotten mistress of Henry the Eighth. Throughout the novel we see Mary grow from a love struck girl in love with the attention of the King,a slave to the wishes of her family- to a strong woman who has learned that life at court will never offer her what she wants(a home, to raise her own children, a loving husband) and defies her family by choosing her own husband and in the act of throwing away fame and power she manages to save herself and her children the fate that was to befall her sister Anne(and several others but I dont want to give the story away). If you enjoy historical fiction, pick up this book and then go out and buy \\"The Constant Princess\\", \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool\\"(in that order). Im counting down the days till Gregory's next book about the Tudor court 'The Boleyn Inheritence\\"."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Excellent read-- the best I have read this summer! I have 6 kids (one only 4 mos old) and read this book in less than a week. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"i highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading about the life of the boleyns and the tudor court. it was fascinating as well as exciting. it was definitely hard to put down. overall it was a very good read, save for a few parts i felt were slightly off.in real life, i personally like anne better than mary, but in this book, anne is portrayed as cruel and greedy. mary is as sweet as can be, to where as i thought she was much different. historians believe that their brother george was not a homosexual, as he is portrayed in the story. the last thing that i thought was sort of frusterating was how the author made it seem as though anne and george really did commit incest, which i thought was a false rumor.other than those few things, this book was one of the best books i have read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This provided some nice historical information about the times; but was a little slow. The way sex was presented was somewhat reflective of bodice ripper novels. The character development was a bit weak. Although I'm an avid reader, I only finished it because it was selected by my book club. It never 'grabbed' me to where I wanted to pick it up and see what would happen next."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am new to Historical ficton and after reading others reviews and comments on this book I picked it up.. and I read it in 4 days.. its an amazing fast read.I LOVED it.."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A Pleasant read against a wonderful background of history, all the romance and intrigue one would expect in the Court of King Henry, as well as the realistic drama of the underhanded plots of families trying to catch the eye of the King by peddling their young daughters. A wonderful read for those who love the genre."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this for an online book club. I'm usually not into historical fiction and I was greatly surprised at the ease that I was caught up in this book. Gregory made me feel like I was there in the story with the characters. It was not just a great read, it was a great experience! The first 50 pages or so are slow going, after that the book comes alive. Gregory is an AMAZING author, I dont remember the last time I was so caught up in a book! For you skeptics, read this, you'll be pleasantly like surprised."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. Anyone looking for an engaging story set in Tudor England will enjoy this book. For those of you looking for strict historical accuracy, this book is loosely woven around the \\"facts\\" of the time. Anyone with any knowledge of this period knows there is quite a bit in question about the events surrounding Henry VIII. This book is FICTION and should be read as such.Philippa Gregory is a magnificent story teller!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"i loved this book from beginning to end. Philippa Gregory brings these historical characters to life. Its a mix of history and romance that just keeps you reading."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory crafts a masterful tale of ambition, lies, deceit, and heartbreak in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" As a young girl, Mary Boleyn becomes Henry VIII's mistress. It's a sweet relationship, but not without its price. Mary loses her innocence as the Boleyn family travels down a path which will force the members of it to lose their souls. Gregory's characters are rich and vivid. Her account of Henry and Anne's relationship will keep the reader riveted to the page.Gregory starts her story in 1521. Mary Boleyn, newly married to William Carey, is fourteen, but she soon captures the king's eye. This does not escape the notice of her family, headed by the Duke of Norfolk who conspires with the Howard and Boleyn sides to have Mary become Henry's mistress. William Carey takes the family decision well, and soon Mary becomes Henry's lover.Henry is initially besotted with Mary, even naming one of the royal ships after her. Young Mary falls in love as a teenage girl would fall in love with an older man. During the period Mary is Henry's mistress, she has two children which Gregory implies was sired by the king.As Mary recovers from the birth of her son in 1525, the family conspires to have Anne hold his attention until Mary can resume her duties. Anne performs her task all too well, sparking Henry's complete fascination with her. Soon, Anne takes over Mary's role in Henry's life and Mary is allowed to go back to her husband.Initially, Mary's relationship is strained with William, but as the months go by they become reacquainted. Unfortunately, William dies of \\"the sweat\\" and Mary loses her chance at happiness.As Anne's star ascends in Henry's life, Mary is all too happy to watch. Soon, she falls in love with a commoner, William Stafford. Sadly, Mary has a ringside seat to her sister's fall from grace. Mary, however, by bucking her family's orders and marrying for love, manages to escape the devastation brought on her family by Anne's fall.Gregory tells the story in the first person from Mary's perspective. She captures a rich voice which allows Mary to endear herself to the reader. The book is full of lush descriptions and gripping emotions proving Gregory's done her homework. The dialogue is easy to read and doesn't slow the reader down. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" will leave the reader with a unique perspective of Anne Boleyn's rise and fall in Tudor England."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was looking forward to reading this before I saw the movie. I am glad I did because now I have a better understanding of the Howards and the Tudors. I have the DVD called \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" and that gave me some insight on Anne Boleyn before I read this. She seemed alot colder, harder and edgier in the book than the way she was portrayed in the movie. This was an enjoyable, entertaining book, though some of the parts felt hollow and repeated. I believe the book could have been shortened and still have been a good read. But I really did enjoy reading about the family and their secret conspiracies that went on in the King and Queen's court. It kept you wondering what would happen next!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was the first book I have read from Phillipa Greagory, and it was great. I have never liked history at all, but this book actually made me interested in the English monarchy."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love Henry vIII and had a blast reading this book. It's historical fiction done for the post-millenium crowd and definitely good beach reading!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put it down. Entertaining, historical (though potentially not entirely accurate)...honestly, I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I just finished this book yesterday and I can't get my mind off of it. I absolutely, 100% loved this book. It has been a while since I have read a really great book and I had hoped that this one would be a good one. Well, it had exceeded my expectations and now gets to join my \\"favorites shelf\\" in my book shelf. This book was so rich, in suspense, tension, desire, human nature, and above all: love. This book described Mary's-the main character- love to her multiple partners so splendidly. It was as if I was feeling each on my own. It was beautiful and magical and everything love is. This was such a great book, and the movie is coming out on February 29. So, in summary, if you just don' know which book to read and this is sitting there, or if you are just looking for a great book, this is the one you want to pick. Trust me, you will love it. I very thoroughly regret finishing it so soon!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While not a piece of literary genius, this is an entralling read that I could barely put down from beginning to end. Any fan of historical fiction should pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"After having read and disliked another of Ms. Gregory's historical novels, I was pleasantly surprised by The Other Boyeyn Girl. There has been criticism of the misleading historical accuracy of this book. I read for pleasure, not historical accuracy. If you want complete accuracy, then please read a textbook. I enjoyed seeing the development of the plot from Mary's viewpoint. There is a heavy dose of sibling rivalry, power struggles, love and deceit. Although this is a lengthy book, the story moves along quickly and I was never bored. Now, I'm looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. Bought it on a whim, I was in the mood for it for some reason, although I've never enjoyed historical fiction before and have never wanted to read it. After a few pages I was hooked and can't stop reading her other novels. I hate history, but this book got me interested in this time period and I can't get enough. It was very interesting, a real page-turner. It made me feel smarter for reading it. I can't compare her with other historical fiction authors because I haven't read anyone else yet. I have to get through all of Gregory's stuff first, then maybe I'll try others. But I truly truly loved this book. So far, my favorite of all of her novels."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Simply the best historical novel I've read in a long time. The detail of character and period hold your attention and the courtly plotting keeps you reading late into the night. Even though I knew how it ended, it is still a surprise to read how it happens. Highly recommend this book.Have just picked up &quot;An Autobiography of Henry VIII...&quot; by Margaret George to get the story from a different perspective."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have read a number of the reviews by Amazon readers, many of them complain that the book is too free with fiction and strays to far from the truth about the Boleyn family. Frankly I have never read any of Philippa Gregory's other novels; but, I found this book to be extremely entertaining due to the well-thought out characterization, and interesting plot (and subplots), the background material was rich in historical details and I foundthe action moved along at a nice quick step.In addition, the very fact that Gregory wrote of a woman often forgotten in history and provides the reader with a well-rounded portrait was personally satisfying. I have read numerous books on Henry the 8th and on Anne Boleyn and they have grown wearisome in the repeating of the known facts. So I say, Hooray for Philippa Gregory and a well-written book that does not in any way, shape or form represent a Harlequin romance!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I personally loved this book.It took the live of Mary Boleyn (a little known figure in Tudor history) and while perserving historical accurateness Gregory painted a tale of young woman caught up in the glitz and glamor of the Tudor court while juggling her feelings of love for a young but married king. I couldn't put this book down for a moment..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Sometimes historical fiction can be dry and difficult to read. This book does not fall into that category. It is well-written and very easy to follow. I like that this novel is based mostly on historical facts. Yes, it's definitely fiction, but the main events of the novel were true to life.This book will be a real eye-opener for anyone who doesn't realize how poorly women have been treated throughout history. They were cursed at birth and then used and abused throughout their entire lives. Their happiness was dependent solely on men. That must have been a horrible way to live. It's especially difficult for the modern American woman to fathom what that kind of life must have been like. It must have been incredibly tough.The relationship between Anne and Mary is bizarre. I know about sibling rivalry, but this went beyond that. This was a cut-throat, evil, primitive sort of relationship. With a sister like Anne, who needs enemies?! I never realized before reading this book how motivated and desperate Anne Boleyn was. She was a woman driven by ambition only. She is a perfect example of you reap what you sow.Of course, Henry VIII is portrayed as he was - a selfish, immature, sex-crazed man who thought he was God. He reinvented the Church so he could divorce Catherine of Aragon, beheaded and poisoned people at will, and sexually used and tossed aside countless women who loved him. He was truly a tyrant.I am glad that Mary escaped the life at court and married William Stafford for love. She might have felt like the lesser Boleyn girl, but I think she was the braver, happier Boleyn girl.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The story is set in the court of Henry VIII and deals with the time between his first marriage, and his third. The atmopshere created is devine, and we feel for each of the women in the novel, as each is manipulated and controlled throughout.As well as learning a lot about the history of England, the author also weaves a love story with many twists and turns. We follow the family relationships, the control over the family by the King, life at the royal court, the maturing the central character, Mary.It's an intense novel that you won't be able to put down. I almost cried when I finished it because I could've read on and on."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"From beginning to end this book was spectacular. The way Philippa Gregory twists fact with fiction is amazing. She makes it so believable, you feel as if you were there. I could not put this book down and can not give it enough praise. I am now reading her next book The Queen's Fool and I am sure it will be excellent as well. This is a must read for anyone who loves this time period."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is such a fantastic book. Once you start reading it you just won't be able to put it down. It makes history come to life in a way that you would never have thought possible. I would recommend this without hesitation to anybody with a love of books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I can't believe I fell asleep in English History class, and yet I was so enthralled with this story. This is an excellent read. The details of life in the court, and the value of a male versus female life, makes you realize how far we have evolved since these times. But mainly it is just a spellbinding tale."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I wasn't very familiar with the Tudor period and knew little about Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, but this book had me engaged from the first page and was a fast read despite the 600+ length. From the characters and wardrobe to the activities that took place within the Royal Court, the author's descriptions were vivid and well detailed. Not being an historian, the book left lingering questions about the era that made me want to buy the text books. I disagree with one reviewer who said the book wrongly blames Anne Boleyn and is degrading to women. Gregory equally portrays King Henry as childish, selfish and incapable of truly loving someone other than himself. This book is &quot;degrading&quot; to those who put greed and ambition above love and virtue. This may sound harsh, but I found myself despising Anne Boleyn's character so much that I secretly delighted in knowing her fate ..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book....Ms. Gregory did a phenomenal job to keep this story entertaining, interesting and highly readable. After reading this, I was prompted to learn more about the Boleyn sisters, though there is hardly any information on Mary.

Definately read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"this novel tells of the tumultuous period before elizabethan england from the point of view of one of its courtiers. rife with intrigue, sex, and betrayals, 'the other boleyn girl' presents the dark, fascinating world behind the glitter and grandeur of henry VIII's court as the infamous king flits from one paramour to another, seeking a male heir, as well as for affection and love where love is forced to be pretentious and often ambitious, ultimately for the sake of claiming the throne and ruling a kingdom almost on its knees. ms gregory is a master storyteller, bringing to vivid life characters and historical events that became the impetus of the tudor dynasty.the story highlights, among others, the insidious and overwhelming power that the women in henry's court wield as they resort to trickery (even witchcraft) and depravity. amidst the raging political conflict lying just beneath the veneer of the most powerful people in that time, readers will continue to experience the emotional battles that the 'other' boleyn girl has to go through as she is first swallowed up in the world of henry's court but later determinedly struggles to carve a life for herself and her family, as far away removed as it can be especially when her sister anne howard became obsessively bent on a destructive path to put her own stake to the throne.a wonderful read for anyone who wishes to experience historical england in the guise of superb storytelling. never loses its momentum, and is sure to deliver until the last page..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love docudramas and this was a good one. I was at the hospital where my mother-in-law was recovering from a hear attack. There were long periods with nothing to do so I looked around in the sparse waiting room for something to read. I found this book and became enslaved and had to read it. Others have done an excellent job of describing the book. I loved knowing history and then getting a sense how the people of that time lived it. Not only was it a good read about Henry V111 court, but there was plot involving France, Spain and the Vatican. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to get a good feel of the times."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a wonderful book that will transport you into the time when Europe was ruled by Kings and Queens. You were either connected to \\"the court\\" or you were poor, which created some very interesting power dynamics. We realize that the ambitious and power hungry Anne Boleyn was a product of her family's lust for power and King Henry's lust for beauty and a son. Philippa Gregory writes history in a way that makes it come alive while maintaining good accuracy in her interpretation. I learned a lot while feeling compelled to read on. What more could one ask from a historical novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Couldn't put this book down from the first entrancing page!

I had a hard time with some of the stuff, like being married at twelve and the beheading, however, I enjoyed the view point from so long ago and how very difficult women had it. I have leant this book out and haven't gotten it back!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I've read in a while. The \\"other\\" girl in the title is the sister of Anne Boleyn, Mary, King Henry VIII's mistress right before his marriage to Anne. The story captures the scheming of the Howard family and how, without regard for Mary's feelings, they pushed her into the king's bed, and so quickly shooed her out when his eyes turned to Anne. Weaved throughout Mary's story is a great depiction of Mary's brother George and his power-hungry wife, Jane Parker (who later testifies against George and Anne, sending them to the Tower of London).Overall, Gregory's novel is a must-read for anyone interested in British historical fiction - this book totally turned me on to learning about Tudor history and the workings of the English court."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have never been one interested in historical fiction, but I bought this book after the blurb on the back peaked my interest. They don't teach you about Anne's sister, Mary, in high school history class. Immediately I was hooked on this novel. Though obviously fictional, Gregory does a great job of getting most of the background about the time period correct. She is a master story-teller and her prose just draws you in. I found myself rushing home from work so I could get back to my book! I thought all of the characters were quite believable, except maybe Jane Parker, and I sympathized with Mary and Queen Katherine. Some of the other reviewers seemed to be put off by a few inaccuracies, but I think if the reader looks at this as a work of fiction influenced by the time period, they will not be bothered, and probably won't even notice. I know I didn't. Also, to address the issue of George's homosexuality, Gregory DOES speak to this in the back of the novel in the interview section. She says that there is a school of thought that believes this theory and that is the one she chose to base that storyline on. I felt she explained herself rather well. Anyways, buy the book, it will keep you up at night wanting to know what will become of poor Mary and her corrupted family."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am a grad student in european history and loved this book. Of course, it is not totally historically correct; as pointed out, Mary is the older sister, not younger, and Henry was born before her daughter. But the impression of romance - correct, from what historians can tell, is true about her marriage with William, her second husband. They did live happily ever after, as far as one can tell. Story, while a long book for some, I read in two sittings and will read again. What a great movie this book would make!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I would not recommend Phillipa Gregory's much-hyped The Other Boleyn Girl. I'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that doesn't make a good first impression, hoping it'll improve. Some six-hundred pages later, I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good. Please don't waste your time! Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as \\"He was executed the next day.\\" Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader! It's extraordinary. It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course, it's a matter of opinion. I simply found it to be void of anything of substance. I wasn't made to care about the characters or how the events played out. And only sex carried the plot along!Also, I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory's imagination, not historical facts. I'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she didn't have a sister or anything of the sort. And I know in this genre much is left to the author's imagination and interpretation; it has to be. It's not as though there's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history. But Gregory herself, when asked how she researches for her books, said she first goes to secondary sources. She never mentioned using primary sources. Yes, they can be biased (if they're from someone's perspective they're going to be), but they're first-hand accounts. Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it, witnessing it? In addition, her dialogue is inconsistent. It's ridiculously modern at some points, then flowery at others. I know it can't be written Shakespeare-style; it has to be readable and understandable. But I think we could be a little more sophisticated! No one said \\"stuff\\" back then, for example, as in, \\"All this stuff is making me mad.\\" She couldn't work a little harder than that??If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses, sex, and scandal, this soap-opera mimic is perfect. If you're like me and want to learn something in the process, however...As I've made obvious, I was sorely disappointed. Just thought I'd pass my warning along. I don't want anyone else wasting his time!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"After just reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by popular author Khaled Hosseini, visiting the world of Tudor England in Philippa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" leads one to believe that the world of women definitely was and is in need of revamping for very different reasons, all of which yield the same result. In \\"Splendid Suns\\" Hosseini describes the plight of women in a misogynist society where the wearing of the burqa is as de rigueur as wiggling into the latest couture jeans and the punishment for disobeying the males-in-command borders on life-threatening beatings. The women of Hosseini's Taliban controlled Afghanistan band together to facilitate a sense of individual freedom--they cover for and comfort each other, understanding that the men in their lives selfishly expect them to endure. Likewise, in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" Ms Gregory creates a similar world--not one where women are abjectly brutalized physically (a beheading or two notwithstanding), but one where the female sex is used to again promote the goals of their masculine counterparts. Like pawns in a chess game, the two sisters in this 600+ page-turner do what they must to advance their family's status within the hierarchy of the English royal court even if that means resorting to whoring, lying, spying, thieving, poisoning and any other manner of debauched and unethical behavior which exemplifies the old Machiavellian adage, \`the end justifies the means'. It seems that women, regardless of a Western or Middle Eastern mindset are meant to perpetuate one thing and one thing alone--the further propagation of the male population.With this theme driving most of the historical novel's plot line, Ms Gregory makes use of the voice of the sensual Mary Boleyn, younger sister to Anne and already a married woman at fourteen to narrate the tumultuous time period in English history where the king becomes the dominant power, imposing his will over both Church and State. Merely a voluptuous child herself, her uncle and father slyly push her forward into the son-starved sight of Henry Tudor, married to the aging Spanish princess Katherine of Aragon, who has failed to produce the requisite prince to be crowned future king. The king's attention proves too much for Mary's naivety and without regard for own well-being, she loves him fully like the girl she is--completely clueless to her family's ultimate goal until sister Anne is brought to court from her long stay in France and pushed forward, this time not as merely a mistress but as a potential queen. With amazing clarity and eye-opening revelations fully depicting the subservient, albeit manipulative role women actually played in the quest for the ultimate power, Mary relates her, at times, innocent yet conniving part in this chess game for the future throne and her eventual sad realization of its high stakes.Gregory does a fine job of allowing the reader to empathize with the frustration of the Boleyn sisters, and their devoted brother George as they contend with the ambitions of the older members of the Boleyn and Howard hierarchy and their rivals, the Seymours. As one sister drives forward with the single-mindedness of a football runningback, the other wearies of the machinations of the court and desires only a peaceful milkmaid's life in the country with a family of her own to love. Fully understanding their lot in life, all three Boleyns pander themselves while they curry for the king's favor, all the while putting first their loyalty to their roots at the expense of their personal happiness.Or perhaps, for them, family success was the only way to attain personal happiness. Although each of the characters does reveal in some of the more somber moments of this roller-coaster-ride for supremacy their most private yearnings, for the most part, the game being played reigns paramount to all concerned parties. Day and night, the Boleyns eat and drink the promotion of the scheme to manufacture a male Boleyn heir to the throne and forever found a ruling dynasty in Britain.And what a tangled web they weave.Ironically, in the wake of all this conniving for future kings, the sovereign that arises in the epilogue of \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" to take over the reins of the English monarchy as one of its most formidable rulers is none other than Elizabeth I, the product of Henry VIII and his second wife, the infamous Anne Boleyn. So be it for all that hankering for the male presence, as I doubt any male could have accomplished better.Written in 2001, this novel obviously predates the currently popular BBC produced series, \\"The Tudors,\\" which chronicles Henry VIII's need for a prince and his willingness to defy Church and State in order to meet his objective. I wouldn't be surprised if the popularity of this book directly motivated the producers of this series to present to a new generation of television watchers the story of this errant king and allow them to marvel at the similarities to today's corrupt moral standards just as an earlier one shook their heads over the landmark 1970 Masterpiece Theatre presentation of \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII.\\" Ever a popular tale, the Henry's saga has been retold many times--the theatrical film starring Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman debuting on February 28 of this year will mark the second time Gregory's novel has been adapted for the screen.Bottom line? Don't look for historical accuracy in this very enjoyable look at rivaling sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn. Instead view Philippa Gregory's fictionalized kingdom for its very universal theme of women as the weaker sex, their affiliation to family and sense of duty towards their religion and country. Like Hosseini in his current bestseller \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" Gregory portrays her women in a very approachable fashion, allowing the reader to delve into their slightly soap opera-ish world and get hooked from the get go. Once immersed in the storytelling, we are privy to the pain these women are forced to endure and the machinations they contrive to forge a future for themselves and their families in a male dominated scenario that unfortunately holds as true in the present as it did in the past. As basic situations do not change, necessity does become the mother of invention. Recommended as an extremely readable glimpse into the fictionalize life of a woman whose goals change as her view of the world matures.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Bolyen Girl was okay. But it had a lot of historical problems. First of all it has Anne as being Mary's older sister, but really its the other way around. It also has Anne as this horrible person, when she wasn't. It has Anne stealing Henry from Mary and wanting to be Queen, but Anne never wanted this. All Anne wanted was to marry Harry Persy. Also it has an actual affair between Anne and George which NEVER happened. Also the sexual scenes are too much in the book. Tell me they had sex, but don't tell me every little detail! Other than all the wrong stuff about Anne this book was okay. WARNING! Do not read this book if you don't want to hear all about other peoples problems and how they made themselves the victim!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's true that historical fictional novels don't have to stick strictly to facts. But \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is completely unconvincing as a novel, not because of its sensationalism, exaggeration, and gross misrepresentation of historical facts, but the dubious characterisation of the two sisters. Mary is the innocent, sweet, moral heroine who is forced to become the King's mistress due to her family's hunger for power. Anne is the cold and calculating villain whose every word points to her monstrous greed and selfishness. The characters are very much one-dimensional, it's like reading a children's fairy tale about how a beautiful and kind heroine fights off the mean and ugly baddies.Gregory's idea of Mary narrating England's most famous historical affair is brilliant. She had an opportunity to write a brilliant masterpiece to both entertain and stimulate. Despite the popularity of the novel my personal reaction to TOBG is that it's tedious and distasteful. This book belongs in the soft porn section of stores rather than works of historical fiction. The dialogues are so vulgar and unrealistic as conversations of two upper-class sisters in the 16th century England. To me they sounded like something you'd read in a trashy magazine article by a prostitute who didn't pass high school English."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Yes the inaccuracies bothered me, but besides that this book was so incredibly boring. I began reading it and quit at about chapter two, then i decided to give it another try, but it was so boring I just gave up. Was it ever going to get good or even interesting? I just could not force myself to stick with it long enough to find out."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"i just recently took up reading, and i have a problem staying interested in a book. when i saw how thick this story was, i got discouraged, but began to read anyways. as soon as i started, i couldn't put it down! i LOVED this book! it was amazing! the author really takes you into the book, and makes you feel like your right there in 1535 with the characters! i definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Last week I finished reading The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory. I really enjoyed it. Historical fiction is not a genre I often read, and I picked up this novel for my Kindle on a whim. I'm very glad I did - the characters are well-rounded and realistic (especially Mary, who we watch progress from a naive child to mature woman of the court), the volatile tempers of Henry and Anne are beautifully described, and I found myself drawn in to the entire court setting and all of its various players.As for length, I'd have to say it could have lost maybe 100 or so pages without hurting the story. I thought the middle chapters paled in comparison to the first and last third. Still, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys courtly intrigues and politics."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is a historical fiction piece narrated from Mary Boleyn, and younger sister of Anne Boleyn, the second wife (and later the beheaded wife) of King Henry VIII. It gives a glimpse of the drive of the Tudor families, and their willingness to do anything to obtain power within the royal family.Mary Boleyn, a girl of only fourteen, and already married, finds that she is the object of King Henry VII's attention, and must become his lover for the advancement of the Boleyn family. This always wavering attention of the King later falls upon her older sister, Anne, whose seduction and drive eventually leads her (head) to the chopping block.Part fiction, part history, this book is a captivating read that I couldn't put down"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in historical fiction and romance."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really can't express how much I loved this book. It is an intelligent read, an introspective read. It really connected with the characters. I felt as if I could have been reading the story of a contemporary. It really is a colossal read and you should give it a go!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My favorite book is Gone with the Wind, and I would say that this is in the same vein. I am always trying to find good historical fiction, and Gregory is fantastic. I have been reading the King Henry books in order, and this is still my favorite. I feel like Gregory gets a little stale after the 3rd book about Henry, so I might switch it up after The Boleyn inheritance and read her new series of books.These books are a little bit of history and whole lot of fun, but not for girls under 16, in my opinion. There are some \\"adult situations.\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am very disappointed as i have not recieved my purchase which was orderedon 5/11/10.It t is to late now for me to post to the Uk.Cant rate it as not recieved it yet! CJ Venour."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I don't read a lot of historical fiction. To me, the past usually equals boring. The Other Boleyn Girl was far from boring. In fact, it was amazing. The story contained so much sex, scandal, deception, and rivalry, it was shocking and deeply entertaining.I saw the movie adaption years ago, and after reading the book, it's obvious the movie was perfectly cast. Obviously, the book went much deeper into the story. The book was long (over 600 pages) and I loved every single page of it. I could not put it down and spent a few mornings bone tired due to \\"just a few more pages\\" that found me awake and reading hours after I meant to go to sleep.So much happens in The Other Boleyn Girl. The story really only spans about fifteen years, but it has a epic feel. The rivalry between Anne and Mary goes well beyond the average sibling rivalry. King Henry is a tool. I believe it's historically documented that he was the epitome of an spoiled, overgrown child, but seeing him in action, so to speak, makes me wonder how he survived so long without being poisoned.The queen fights for her man in a peculiar way, leaving the reader to wonder why she ever thought that would work. George, brother to Mary and Anne, brings about a very interesting and surprising look at court. And the rest of the Boleyn family, and their involvement in younger generations lives - especially sex lives - reeks of sleaze and conniving. Actions and events so shocking, yet thoroughly realistic, make The Other Boleyn Girl very memorable.There are multiple romances in The Other Boleyn Girl, each markedly different from the next. These relationship do well to show how love, and lust, can vary greatly between couples. More than anything else, The Other Boleyn Girl is about the lengths a woman would go to to become and remain queen. No line remained uncrossed in The Other Boleyn Girl and I found it to be juicer than any modern tabloid."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Like a Dirty Little Secret I loved this book but found myself having several \\"OMG moments\\" while reading some of the devious details of life at Court."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I've never been into historical fiction surrounding the English court before reading this book. Gregory's character development is so strong that it doesn't seem cliche or awkward, which is often an annoying element of this type of book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It's a real page turner and kept me up til 3 am trying to finish it before I had to go to sleep. Full love/drama which is what I love about this one.While I found this book to be an excellent read, I am disappointed in the pricing. The Kindle eBook edition is $12.99 while the print version is only $10.88. eBooks cost essentially nothing to distribute, so why the eBook version costs more baffles me. This price difference made me so angry I refused to purchase this eBook or the print version and give the publishers money for ripping me off. I borrowed the print version of this book from a friend instead."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is a book that has haunted me since the movie was released. Although I didn't see the film until after I had read the book (and thank goodness, too!), the book kept calling to me, mostly because I had heard the title and the concept sounded interesting -- the story of Anne Boleyn, told from the perspective of her sister.Who doesn't know the story of Anne Boleyn, the woman who dethroned Catherine of Aragon and married King Henry VIII? It was Anne Boleyn who helped Henry to found the Church of England, and it was Anne who was the first executed wife of King Henry the VIII, put to death on charges of incest, adultery and treason.The stories of the other Boleyns are less-told: George and Thomas, Mary and Elizabeth (Anne's Mother, not her daughter) are less well known. The Other Boleyn Girl begins to tell the story of Anne's siblings, Mary and George, and the relationships that they had with one another and with Anne.In spite of my intense desire to read The Other Boleyn Girl, I was disturbed the idea that I believed the book would be dry. I pondered the length of the novel (nearly 700 pages) and the content (I am no a history buff by any means) and several times overlooked the book. I couldn't bring myself to spend the money on this novel.When I ran into The Other Boleyn Girl at a used book store, however, I snatched it up eagerly and perhaps a bit greedily and read it promptly.While Philippa Gregory takes some license with the story line regarding Mary, George and even Anne, I felt that this book was a wonderful, fast-paced and easy read. I was able to pick it up and put it down during waiting periods and still finished reading it within a week of having started the book.I highly recommend The Other Boleyn Girl and look forward to reviewing other books in the Tudors series!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book! I love Henry VIII already, but this book was so well written! Couldn't put it down!! Loved it so much I also bought the Boleyn Inheirantce. I watched the movie afterwards and wasn't really impressed,but the books really wows!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I've been in the mood for a good historical novel lately and I found it in spades in The Other Boleyn Girl. This is the story of the swirl of plotting and romance around Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn and the many others with an interest in unseating Katherine of Aragon and making Anne Henry's new queen. I love a historical novel that makes you truly feel the times and this book does so; moreover the rich writing and portrayal of historical detail is meshed in a plot that while familiar to any student of history, is still suspenseful because you come to care for all the players' fates. The master stroke was telling the story through the conflicted viewpoint of Anne's sister, Mary, who was Henry's lover before Anne. She can see what is both admirable and loathsome in those around her at court, especially Henry and Anne themselves, and since her side of the story is less well-known, the suspense comes in seeing how she will make it through the tragic turn of events when Anne is inevitably rejected. A truly excellent historical novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a delightful and gripping read for a poor student of world history. Slowly I am putting together the pieces of the past and this book helped. It is vivid, compelling and hard to put down. As a mother of four, it was a wonderful escape. I would recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys the intrigue of human relationships and life's protocols during the Elizabethean era."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If any of you are kids, reading the reviews for this book, I'd warn you, this book can be disgusting in places... Mary Boleyn is a gorgeous dame, who was Queen Katherine of Aragon's favourite made. Yet her beauty catches the rogue king's flirtatious eyes. They have an extreme affair, despite the king and Mary's marriage. Mary gives her heart, soul, and virginity, and becomes the mother of two children, both whose father is King Henry VIII. But the king is fickle. Soon, his sights turn to vain, witty, intelligent, and duskly beautiful Anne Boleyn - Mary's more ambitious and more intelligent sister. Anne was not a typical English beauty, yet her wits and personality was probably more to desire from the King's position. Anyway, if you believe you are mature enough, I'd say go for reading this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Having never read historical fiction before, I was marveled by Gregory's work. I started it wondering if it would grab me enough to hold me for 600+ pages. Instead, I found I was drawn to this book like practically no other - every spare moment I had was spent reading it and I finished it in under a week. Gregory spins her tale seamlessly and enchantingly and her book has piqued an interest in Tudor England that I never would have had otherwise. She made every character spring to life and I felt like I was inside those courts everytime I opened the book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As an avid reader, I found this book to one of the most fascinating I have ever read. Although lengthy, I read it in just 4 days (and I am a Mom with a full-time job, I don't have much free time) and I was sorry when I got to the end. I would say that those who enjoy reading Tudor history should most definately read this book, but quite frankly I think even those who just enjoy reading a good book should read this, it has all the elements of any good story but the fact that it is based on a true story just makes it all that much more interesting. While I have always been a fan of world history, I have developed an entirely new interest."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book kept me up all night that i ended up reading it in two days. Loved it!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this book down, it was intoxicating! It really transports you to the court of Henry IIIX and watch out, you're in for a wild ride! I loved this fictional account of what life might have been like for Mary and Anne Boleyn. It's always a time in history that has fascinated me, and this book truly shares a captivating story of the times, the King and the Boleyn family."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Like it says in the title- this book is fabulous! It was outstanding. I've never read a book that took place during this period in time, so I'm new at this. But I'll tell you it totally surprised me how interesting the author made it. I expected it to be dry- it was so far from it. It's over 600 pages, but I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about it. So if you're new to this genre as well, I would recommend this book to you.To those of you who read this type of a novel everyday, I know you might have a different opinion than me. This book is fiction, with some truth mixed in. Depending on what you think of that- I'd say you'd like this book or maybe not.The reasons I liked this book so much-It was easy to read. No vocabulary problems, no old-English spoken.The characters were unforgettable. There were many, so you have to keep close tabs on who each are, but once they became major players, they really pull you in. Plus, knowing these people did exsist made it all the more fun.The drama, betrayal, love, lust, passion, scandal, courage, strength, and suspense.Go read it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's hard to sum up such a awesome book in a few words. Plus, it's huge- over 600 pages. First, I went into this not knowing much about this subject and the people, so if you're in the same boat this review might be helpful to you.I loved it! The writing was so easy to get into and it was very easy to read. I was hooked after about 20 pages. And for me that's saying a lot. I really got into these people's lives and I often had to remind myself that this was not fact, but a lot of fiction. However, I find this story compelling and likely to be very close to the truth.I really don't have a complaint about the book. I enjoyed everything about it. Most of all learning about life in the royal kingdom. As I said, I have never read any books on this subject or studied much about it in school, so I was thoroughly enthralled. If you're looking to try something new or kingdoms of England are a favorite of yours I really recommend this book. Beware that it's not all proven fact, but I think you won't mind once you see how fun reading this book is!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Well, I couldn't put it down, once I started in earnest. The characters are rich and well drawn. The historical perspectives leaves a bit to be desired. Ms Gregory does miss out on some of the dialogue of the time, playing up on some of the &quot;rumors&quot; instead of facts. A few of the characters are not historically accurate. If you can ignore the inaccuracies, this is a definite page turner and is excellently told. I can forgive a little license for a good story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have always been interested in the monarchy ever since my Mum took me to the Tower of London as a small child. I particularly homed in on the Tudors and Henry VIII, so when my Mum put The Other Boleyn Girl in front of me I couldn't read it quick enough. I soon found that I couldn't put it down and was itching to find out what happened next in this fictional (but historically corect) saga. Philippa Gregory seems to have this knack of drawing you in to the story as if you're right there at court. I have since read The Queen's Fool in hardback which is equally gripping and The Virgin's Lover. I would recommend anyone to start off with The Other Boleyn Girl and work through to The Virgin's Lover as there are clever references in each book which leads back to the latest story. I can't wait until the next book is out as I'll definately be ordering it. Beautiful work."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was very skeptical of historic fiction at first, but my fascination with the story of Henry and Anne made me pick up this book and boy, am I glad I did!! Phillipa Gregory writes with such familiarity, you feel as though you have been pulled into court life at the time of Henry VIII. It makes you feel all the concern, sympathy, irritation and endearment for the characters that we all long to feel while reading a great book. This is the kind of bedtime read that makes you late for work in the morning! I am now a fan of this genre, but this particular one remains my new favorite. (I've read it 3 times!!) Even thought you know the story, you've never heard it like this! Pick up this book, and I guarantee you'll be looking for another Phillipa Gregory novel soon after!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book kept my attention from start to finish. It is filled with history and depicts Henry VIII and Anne Boelyn quite truthfully in my opinion. Neither was a kind person, nor a good person -- that is generally known, this book brings out the personalities of the pair very well. It reaffirmed what I already beleived about both people-- I always thought Henry VIII and Anne Boelyn deserved eachother, this book will explain why perfectly."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I do not typically enjoy historical fiction especially if the book focuses too much on the historical facts than on creating a story. However, this book changed my thinking. The story was extremely compelling in its description of life in the Royal Court as well as family ambitions and gender roles during that period. I forgot that I was actually learning about history because I became so involved in the story. Also, the book included many surprises which I did not imagine. Just an incredible read overall."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The novel is about the Boleyn family, an ambitious family at the court of Henry the VIII and their relentless pursuit of gaining the king's favor and maintaining a superior place at court. The narrator is the \\"lesser known\\" Boleyn sister, Mary, who as a young sweet 13 year old, becomes Henry's mistress, with her family's cunning manipulation. Upon gaining the king's favor, her ambitious family, pit her and her more infamous and conniving sister, Anne, to maintain the Kings' attention. Anne, with her wit, intelligence, wily ways and more exotic beauty, eventually becomes Henry's 2nd wife. This comes at the cost of the loss of popularity among the people of England, and a controversy that leads to her demise as she displaces the popular Queen, Catherine of Aragon. Mary, who is initially disillusioned and hurt, eventually finds love and her way out of court, but losses grace in the eyes of her family.The story is rich with romance, sex, scandal, politics, intrigue and drama. It is deliciously entertaining and filled with various trivia that reel you in and make you wonder about the real story behind what is common knowledge. Before reading this book, I was never into the whole Tudor England-history. Being previously uninformed about this, I enjoyed learning about the monarchy, life at court and a general history of Henry VIII.Although the book is probably well researched, it is likely that many details were embellished and perhaps inconsistent with other accounts. But you must remember, this is a work of FICTION. If you already consider yourself an expert on this topic and are looking for another accurate account you may be disappointed. I enjoyed this book but cannot deny that the writing borders on romance-novel quality, so, I would only recommend this book if you are LOOKING TO BE ENTERTAINED while learning a few things about the Boleyns, Tudor England and life at court in the 1500's."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My star rating for a book usually comes from a combination of whether the book met my expectations and whether it conveyed what the author intended. For these reasons, I think \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" deserves at least five stars.Serious readers of history, especially those who like to stick to the facts, probably should avoid this novel. But it was perfect for me, an avid reader of fiction, who had forgotten most of the history surrounding Henry VIII. For all reviewers who said this book seemed similar to a romance novel, I wholeheartedly and unabashedly agree. Like the heroines of most romance novels, Phillippa Gregory's heroine was not extremely complex. But she was admirable, which made the book extremely easy and enjoyable to read. No, the characters in this novel aren't very mutli-faceted, but they do seem very realistic and they are all very compelling.I don't think Phillippa Gregory meant for the book to be a strictly detailed rendering of Henry's court. She even says in an interview in the back of the novel that the first thing she wants readers to take away from the book is a \\"terrifc reading experience.\\" I read the book at every chance I could get for a week straight, talked about it when I wasn't reading it, and even dreamed about it one night. I don't think my \\"reading experience\\" could have been any more vivid or enjoyable. I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy history and fiction and are looking for an easy--and fascinating--story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. Very well written. It describes the inner working of the King's court, the jealousies, rivalries, and ambitions to stay in the King's favor. Romance, secrecy, affairs, pregnancies, sibling rivalry, power hungry...it has it all."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Excellent book...hard to put down. Well researched historical fiction, lots of insight to the workings of the court and the lives of the courtisans. Highly recommend. My bookclub initially committed to read only half the book for one monthly meeting, reserving the rest for the following month. But everyone finished a week ahead of the first meeting."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I must admit that I don't usually read historical fiction, but I kept either seeing and hearing about this book. Of course I had some general knowledge of King Henry VIII (and all the wife-killing) and I had a very vague sense of his second wife Anne Boleyn, but never would I have expected to become totally involved with characters from that time period. The main characters were so vivid and their personalities were so familiar, the novel could have easily taken place today.The Boleyn siblings (Anne, Mary, and George) are brought to the king's court at an early age to help fatten the family purse. Mary, in her early teens, is encouraged to cozy up to the married king. She bears the king two children--a daughter and a son. One would think having a son would please a king--but sadly an illegitimate son cannot be heir to the throne.While Mary's been handling the bedroom duties for the king, her sister, Anne has been plotting on her position. Cunning Anne not only finangles her way into Mary's spot, but using her superior feminine wiles, she also manages to overthrow the reigning queen.Brother George \\"looses his head\\" over another man.When Anne, now Queen Anne, can't deliver an heir to the throne...well, it's off with her head.Mary's story ends well, but with all that family dysfunction and mayhem going on in the castle (heads rolling at the king's whim) it's a miracle Mary was able to leave the castle physically and emotionally unscathed.This was a great historical read with some unexpected steamy sex, which added more spice to an already spicey tale."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I decided to read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend. The plot mirrors the title of \\"the Other Boleyn Girl\\" by telling the fictional account of Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary.I found that the plot developed quite slowly. The book was good, however I feel that it could have been cut quite a bit shorter than it was. I did like the different perspective from which it was written, but overall, the plot was very circular, and lacked any suspense. I felt as if I knew exactly what was going to happen throughout the whole novel, and for the most part, I did. This novel does a good job at aligning the fiction with the fact, but I think it could have been done better. I am kind of indifferent towards this book. I do however, recommend that if you start it, you finish it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was awful. I like historical fiction but I expect the author to do the homework and keep it realistic for the time. She has the female character go riding off alone on the road to find her lover. Imagine that a lady would do that in those dangerous times - I don't think so! She doesn't do anything with the final romance with the servant. It was boring. The only thing this book did was make me look up the real history to see what really happened. There was no way that Henry sired a son with this girl - he was desparate for sons and would have claimed the child even if it was a illegitimate. I won't read anything else by this author."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"You've got to find this book appealing because of the time period it covers - the early Reformation. It was a time of great upheaval in the Church, and many Europeans were forced to re-examine their core beliefs about papal supremacy, the authority of God's word, and the sanctity of marriage. In such a vital, dangerous, and exciting time, two sisters from the Howard family, Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary Boleyn, emerged to become rivals for the affections of King Henry VIII.As we all know, Anne Boleyn fought her way to the throne, eventually becoming queen of England and the mother of Elizabeth I.The first thing I noticed about the book was its length of over 600 pages. Normally, I'd be wary of such a contemporary novel, as they nearly all seem to go 400 pages (frequently for no good reason); however, in this instance, I think it is necessary for Gregory to drag her story out. Even though I knew what was in store for the Boleyn sisters, I began to wonder if Anne would ever get to the throne of England in this book, and perhaps there was a sequel to the book that I just hadn't noticed. By taking the steps slowly, Gregory makes us feel all of the impatience and frustration that Anne felt, if not the desperation. So, for pacing the novel, I give the author high marks.Some readers have criticized Gregory's portrayals of the Howard family and of Anne specifically. Some call the portrayals overly negative, judgemental, harsh, and one-sided. Obviously, Gregory feels comfortable painting a heartless picture of many characters in the book, whether deserved or not (and I suspect, though I don't know, that some of her characters in her other novels suffer a similar rendering). It's Gregory's story to tell, and if she wants to pit greed and selfishness against sweetness and light (as in her characterization of Mary), then have at it, I say. As a reader, ask yourself if you would have kept turning the pages of this book given a more nuanced, historically accurate portrayal. Clearly, Gregory is very familiar with the concept of oppositional elements, and these elements combine to tell a romping good tale, one that, as the evidence shows, met a highly successful reception in Gregory's chosen market.TOBG has some rather glaring grammatical errors. For that reason, it doesn't get my highest rating. If you're not annoyed by such things, read the book. It is a work of escapism and a perfect distraction from the stress of modern life."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Go into this novel understanding that the writing will be stylistically poor, the characters one-dimensional, and the plot development a bit static, and you can still eke out some enjoyment from it.When I began reading, I realized how shockingly little I actually knew about the subject and wanted to learn more about these fascinating people. Unfortunately, I had to go outside the book to do so. Not a single character breaks out of one-dimensionality. No one is developed past a single defining trait, which quickly become dead horses as, at every opportunity, Gregory repeats them for you. On page 10, all that can be said of Mary and Anne is that each is respectively sweet/naive and cunning/ambitious. Read another hundred pages and still no more can be said of either.This lack of fundamental development plagues her writing in all aspects, but I won't list them and rant. I can understand the one star reviews some give. However, if she must write poorly, at least she writes poorly about an interesting microcosm in history. Though the characters will still be soulless strangers to you upon finishing, hopefully you'll share my experience of having a piqued interest in this period that you can pursue.While I was amused by it and am glad to have read it, I can't in good conscience give a rating of 3 stars. It is a below average work. If you're looking for a beach read (unchallenging, reads quickly), this is probably your book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I suppose my first review wasn't approved. I have finished the book and my opinion has been elevated slightly. I can give it two stars. Once I got past the first 150 pages, the tone of the book improved, but then the original tone returned at the end and I was disappointed and annoyed, almost as if the beginning and end were written and then the middle came much later -- or it was edited by two different editors...it doesn't flow somehow and I can't put my finger on it.So although I give it two stars now, it's still not worth the $7.99 to me. I still wonder if the movie might not be the rare occasion that improves upon the book. I still feel that Gregory writes more to appeal more to those who enjoy the Romance novel genre. It may be \\"historical\\" fiction but it takes serious liberties with the history -- and that's fine. I've just happened to read historical romance that was more consistently written as well as being better developed than \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". I really don't understand the hype."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am not into historical fiction--or at least I wasn't, until I read this book. It was a pick for my book club and I honestly was not all that excited, although I had heard great things about it. I read the first chapter and some of the second and passed it on to a friend, deciding I would read it later on, because I just wasn't into it. She gave it back to me in less than 3 days (the book is over 600 pages), telling me that it was incredible and that she couldn't believe that I had put it down...that said, I decided to give it a second shot, and I am SO glad that I did. It is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read. I honestly could not put it down and my poor children had macaroni and cheese two nights in a row (I really couldn't stop reading to cook), and watched a little extra TV while I read it...I got completely sucked in and could not get enough of it. I found myself googling the characters to learn more about them. Prior to reading the book, I knew a little about Anne Boleyn--mostly about the horrible fate she suffered. After reading it, I felt as though I had actually LEARNED something about a period of time that I just was completely unfamiliar with. Philippa Gregory's imagination--her ability to creaate dialogue and to fill in the gaps with such incredible detail and such well-written descriptions of the period--beyond impressive. She has an ability to create a captivating tale from such a famous part of history with such famous characters--in such a way that you truly can't put it down. I think her choice of Mary to narrate the tale, instead of Anne, was what made the book. Mary's perspective starts out so young and naive and after all she sees, endures and learns, she ends up much wiser than anyone realizes or ever gives her credit for. Gregory's development of Anne started with me feeling badly for her, then hating her, then almost feeling badly for her, again. There are so many characters in this book, and she does such a great job describing them and bringing them to life.I am in the midst of reading another one of her books, which, so far, is equally as good. Philippa Gregory has converted me to a fan of historical fiction!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It was a \\"fun\\" read, using today's perspective, in to how women were viewed, used and abused in Tudor times.

Wow, was I wrong! Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. As a student of history, I must say that the author does a wonderful job of integrating a story into a fascinating time period.

Specifically, I was a little worried about the time period in which the book was set. I found it hard to believe that I could understand and relate to characters from the 16th century. Ultimtately, I came to love (and hate- depending on the person) the characters and the storyline. I am 24, and I gave the book to my mother, and she gave it to my father, who then gave it to my younger sister. We all enjoyed it tremendously."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As a Tudor fanatic I was a little leary about reading this book, unsure of what to expect. What a delightful surprise to find out it was one of the most amazing tales I have ever read.Incorporates history and fictional so smoothly that you would swear the author was really back in 1525 writing it as she saw it happening. This is a must have in anyone's personal book collection."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Compulsively readable and unputdownable, Philippa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" has to be her most striking work (recently made into a film adaptation). An exquisite historical masterpiece that professes such poignancy, this is a tale that shall never be forgotten for it remains firmly etched within your memory. Established and accomplished author, Philippa Gregory holds a deep understanding and awareness of the Tudor age as well as background studies in eighteenth-century literature, which she brings to the page with such effortless ease and assuredness. If you are a fan of historical fiction, then I would highly recommend this as not only a stand-out book but by (whom I believe to be) the best author within this genre.At just a mere fourteen years of age Mary Boleyn catches the eye of the greatest rulers to have sat upon the throne, Henry VIII and so begins her quest to satisfy this powerful man. However, Mary is obliged to pass on to her sister Anne all her acquired knowledge and insight into what makes Henry VIII \`tick' and how to please him. As Mary divulges the key to Henry's desires she sadly must endure the consequences, as her sister soon becomes irresistible and so Mary is faced with dejection. This truly heartrending, poignant act was captured so sharply that you feel for Mary and can sense her inner suffering as ambition consumes Anne Boleyn.This is a tale that really speaks to the heart, for it addresses that bond between sisters which can never be severed over the overwhelming feeling of love. Full of heated rivalry, lustful desires and self-absorbed ambition you are swept into the heart of the dazzlingly dangerous Tudor court; at the mercy of the most influential monarchs of all-time. As two sisters fought for the greatest prize of all...the love of a King, along the way they must overcome hardships and suffering, injustice and coldness if they are going to end up triumphant. Beautifully atmospheric, every single little detail is captured as if by the hand of a painter so as to create a clear, vivid picture of the times for you to plunge into. The shimmering gold cover and photograph of Hever Castle, complete with a copy of the original letter written by Anne Boleyn to Henry VIII this is a must-have treasure for any Tudor fanatic and historian.Vividly evocative, this enthralling tale of passion, loyalty and betrayal is truly astonishing as to amaze and which I look forward to re-reading very soon!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book & actually finished it in less than a week! I understand that people feel very strongly about Anne Boleyn, but I just want to stress that this book is NOT supposed a history book! I think we can imagine that certain conversations may have gone the way that Gregory described, and others, of course, were different. I loved the story, and Gregory's writing was mature, but also, easy to get through (with maximum comprehension). I can't get over how ruthless Anne was, but the love between sisters (and family) was so strong - I just loved this story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A very personal historical story--one that is little known--A picture of life under a brutal English KingThe author gets to your heart and helps you understand the political reasons behind many decisions of the day."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A wonderful explorative look at the position of women's place in the family unit of society. Philippa did a wonderful job bringing these women to life. So masterfully written to make you feel as you know them."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"PG to me seems to want to rewrite history to make Mary Boleyn more important than she actually was.I wonder what PG has against Anne Boleyn. She seems to sympathize way too much with Katharine and Mary. The idea of Anne as a wicked stepmother persecuting 'poor innocent Mary' is false as Mary's treatment worsened after Anne was beheaded. Also, while Mary was no monster, she is responsible for the deaths of her own people. She is not innocent by any means. The young Mary deserves pity, the adult Mary does not.Anyway, PG takes every rumor about Anne and presents them as fact and even invents a new one, such as Anne adopting Mary's son. There is no basis in fact for this. Having read her later works, it seems to me PG despises Anne and her daughter Elizabeth. I understand this is fiction, but many people who are not as educated in history as myself may take this as fact. I am very concerned, especially since Anne is long dead and cannot stand up for herself.As for the book-- I am not squeamish in regards to sex. But PG has written a porno, not a novel. For example, \\"Put your fingers in your cunny....\\" I had to skip over half the book due to scenes like this. PG, please leave this to your readers' imagination. We do not need to know what Henry and Anne Boleyn did in the bedroom!There is one thing I will say for this book and that is that it got historical fiction going again. That is why I give this book a very generous 2 stars."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is my absolute favorite novel/book EVER!!!!

It is essentially bad Tudor porn. No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable. Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me. Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history. Do some basic research. If I can refute the basic \\"facts\\" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer.

From the beginning I felt myself compelled into the world of the Tudor Dynasty and the madness of King Henry VIII. Though the book isn't historically acurate it did make me want to read more into the situation between the Pope and the King of England and more about the six wives of King Henry. I thought the book was well written about the lives of the sisters and the ambitious family that took every advantage given to them and only saw their children as politcal gain in the game. I thought Gregory did a wonderful job and I'm now starting another book by her."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I decided to read this book because I was really interested in seeing the movie. I did not know much about the history of the Tudors nor Anne Boleyn. But I could tell right away by reading this book that the author, Philippa Gregory is extremely biased towards Anne Boleyn. She's turned her book into a critique of how women, such as Anne, who are struck by ambition into some kind of incestuous monster who is ready to push anyone out of her way. To me, there are two types of books: page turners and books that move very slowly but have a lot of substance. The Other Boleyn Girl is the latter. I kept reading this book because I have this unwavering commitment to finish a book, hoping that the end will somehow redeem this craptastic fest of trash. This book really teeters on the border of a trashy romance novel. I will never read anything by Gregory again."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book takes a few pages to find its momentum, which is the ONLY reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five. The political machinations of the upwardly mobile Boleyn family in their quest to have land, power and titles for their men, while putting their women out as brood mares, is a concept that was ripe for Philippa Gregory's golden touch.This story is told from the point of view of Mary, Anne Boleyn's sister; the first of the two to be sent to Henry VIII's bed (in the novel, she is younger than Anne, but in real life, she was the older of the two). Anne's cap was set for Henry while Mary was giving birth to his son, and her family's ambition soon gave way to that of her own. Anne Boleyn does NOT come off well here - she is a vain, selfish woman with no concept of the precedent she set by getting Henry VIII to set aside his first wife for her. If it could be done FOR her, it could be done TO her.All the innuendo that was present during Anne's time is here: the hint that one of Anne's miscarried children was conceived in a shocking way, George Boleyn's indiscretions, witchcraft, and the rest made for pages turning late into the night. Mary's personal story of being married to a man she didn't know, then being bedded by the King, and her fight to keep her children by that King, makes me want to know more about her. Too sad that she wasn't important enough at the time for anyone to take too much note of her - she was only the Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I think there's been enough debate within these reviews that Philippa Gregory's novel is not the most historically accurate and presents a biased view against Anne Boleyn that probably isn't true. I'm in agreement there. But I still give this book 4 stars because at its heart it's a fictional romance novel. Dare I say a \\"trashy romance novel\\"? It's a good read. And relatively quick given it's 660 pages. I refer to it as \\"trashy\\" (in a good way) because there are some parts that are better read on a weekend beach blanket than on your bus ride to work.If you're in to Tudor history, this is not the book for you. But a good summertime read? When I finished it, I passed it to my friend on the beach blanket to the left."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It seems every time I turn around I see a Philippa Gregory book in the bookstores, at the airport, on a train--and for good reason. Gregory's books for the most part focus on England from the 16th to 18th centuries, from the Tudors themselves to fictional hangers-on. She has a fast-paced style, a talent for dialogue, and throws in just enough history for historical fiction buffs like me. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" starts off as the story of Mary Boleyn, the shadowy sister of the fiery Anne, briefly the lover of Henry VIII and the mother of one of his illegitimate sons. Mary is a simple girl, caught up in court intrigue, used as a pawn in the never-ending battles betwen the great families of England to get close to the King. This book is really about Anne, however, and the use of Mary as the narrator to tell Anne's story is a neat twist. One thing that a modern reader might find amazing is the ages of the principal movers at court--at times it's as if a gang of pretty teenagers wields the power to direct the course of the monarchy and the country. The Henry VIII here is a man easily distracted, fond of women and amusement, not willing to let anyone or anything stand in the way of his desire for an heir. We're all familiar with this story, but Gregory has a unique way of making it real--the exhaustion of the endless rounds of parties, the uncles of the great families endlessly scheming, the use of young girls to catch the King's eye. Mary, the most innocent, is the only one who escapes, however; she fades from the limelight as the King turns elsewhere, and saves herself and her children just in time. Little is known about Mary, but Gregory manages to turn it into a great story without doing too much damage to the facts. These books aren't too heavy but totally engrossing. A nice alternative to chick lit."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was the first novel by Ms Gregory that I've read and I did enjoy it.There were some flaws. First, I question some historical accuracy....that brother George was [...] for example. In truth many historians portray him as quite a womanizer. Secondly, how could Mary, sister to Anne Boleyn and Henry's first mistress, be so utterly unaware of what life at court was all about? Her sister was so astute...as was her brother, father and mother. Mary is portrayed as almost witless at times and she could not possibly have been such a dimwit and survived a week in that hot-bed of intrigue and deceit that was Henry's court. At this time, woman were merely chattel so the high ideals of woman's rights espoused by many characters didn't quite work. On the other hand, I do think Ms. Gregory's prose moves right along, and she was accurate on major political details. In addition, she captured wonderfully the ambiance of court life, the beauty of the gowns, the lavish feasts and celebrations, and the totally decadent lifestyle. She also captured the character of Henry the VIII, a man so deluded by his own place in life he thought he could usurp God. How could he not see himself as an abolute ruler with all the fawning and false admiration from his courtiers? I saw him as a sad man, facing old age and diminished physical strength without an honest and loving companion, without a single person he could truly trust. He had everything and nothing.This book held my interest throughout which is saying something for a book of what, 700 pages? and made we want to read non-fiction books about this time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"In the history of English monarchy, Henry VIII's life will remain one of the most fascinating even if only for the fact that he went through Queens as voraciously as he went through food. And of his many wives, Anne Boleyn has cemented herself as probably the most controversial. Yet before Anne's ascend to the royal throne, her sister was the most favored by the king. In this book, Philippa Gregory charts the rise and fall of the Boleyn family as seen through the eyes of the \\"other Boleyn girl.\\"It is 1522 and Mary Boleyn is one of Queen Katherine's favorite ladies-in-waiting. Although already married to one of King Henry's courtiers, she catches the king's eye and is soon the recipient of his seductive advances. Meanwhile, hungry for power, Mary's family plots to advance their position in the king's favor and realizes that Mary is the key to achieving their ambitions. Thus, they order her to set aside her marriage and forced her against her moral scruples and religious beliefs to become the king's mistress. Shortly after, she bears the king two children. When the second birth forced Mary to confinement, the family fears that her \\"unavailability\\" to the king would lead him to another woman. Therefore, her sister Anne is ordered to take her place to ensure that the king's eye doesn't wander. Thus begins Mary's fall from the king's favor as Anne sets out to seduce, captivate and manipulate him. But while her sister was a reluctant mistress to the king, Anne is a willing participant and takes things one step further by ensuring that Queen Katherine's throne is cleared for her ascent. But as we have learned from history, it all ends when Anne and her brother George become the victims of their family's dangerous game as their lives ended at the scaffold, while Mary, dubbed by everyone in court as \\"the other Boleyn\\", escapes when she turns her back on her family's game, remarries and live a quiet life in the country.THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is a novel about greed, power and sibling rivalry. From the start we see the magnitude of the novel as we are introduced to Mary and Anne and various other characters that play pivotal roles in the lives of these two Boleyn sisters. It was fascinating reading about the hunger of their family for power, the way they didn't care which sister the king slept with as long as it secures the Boleyns' position in the court. Reading about the family meeting to plot and manipulate was like watching an intense chess game. And seeing it in the eyes of the only Boleyn with scruples is what makes this book so deep and compelling. Mary's portrayal as the meek and kindhearted sister adds to the depth of Anne's ruthlessness and venomous character.This book is a riveting and compelling read. It is a real page-turner and I guarantee that you won't be able to put it down once you start reading. While many people, especially historians, would dispute the accuracy of some aspects in this novel, you need to keep an open mind and remember that this isn't meant to be a literary accounting of the lives of the Boleyns, but a historical fiction based on their lives."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book starts out wonderfully. Gregory leads us through the court of the king and through the many plots of the various families attempting to come into power. I liked the relationship amongst the Boleyn siblings, it was fascinating and made it feel like you knew these historical characters.However, by the middle of the book the story started to drag. Too much time is spent on how long the sisters waited and waited until they could each marry or have a relationship with the king. Also, something that bothered me, but perhaps not other readers, was that the story become one about sex by the end.Overall, this is a good book that introduces us to this time period, but too long and slow."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I never read historical fiction but the book was recommended by a valued friend who is a voracious reader so I reluctantly decided to give it a try. It was probably the best book I had read in several years. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Interesting piece of historical fiction set in the court of King Henry. I enjoy how the story was told by the point of view of Anne's sister. However, for the first 2/3rd's of the book, the cycle is repetitive- the sisters resume their activities at court, they argue with each other, feelings get hurt, one of the sisters gets sent away, she comes back, repeat. Of course there are little side diversions which vary, but I felt the first portion of the book to be redundant. On the flip side, the ending came too quick. I am sure Anne Boleyn felt the same way.A little trashy, but oh how I did look forward to reading it every night!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was a very, very long ten day ride. i spent half that time clutching the book tightly in my hands, unable to put it down, and the other half staring at it in utter disgust. I'll talk about what I liked first, because that's the easiest. I loved the description of everyday court life, and I loved how treacherous it could be for those who didn't know how to play the game. The masques, jousts, feastings, and clothes were all described in vivid detail, and I felt like I was right in the middle of things. Also, Philippa Gregory foreshadows a lot in the first couple chapters, and even those who don't know the history of Anne Boleyn can nearly guess what will happen to her towards the end.Unfortunately, that's about it for the good...because everything else about this book made me mad.As most other reviewers have mentioned, Philippa Gregory clearly hates Anne Boleyn with a passion. I want to be a writer one day, and I've taken classes and read books about writing, and despite being the amateur I am, I know historical fiction writers shouldn't let their biases show through their work. Why this woman has it in for Anne Boleyn, I don't know...Maybe she was Katherine of Aragon in a past life or something.(Sorry, KOA, just trying to explain my point!) Anyway, Anne is completely made into such a Machevellian villain in this book and she is demonized. All of a sudden, she's committing murders, stealing sons, poisoning people, and resorting to incest and witchcraft to create a male heir. All the things she was accused of and died for, but was proved to be innocent of doing.Speaking of incest, Anne and George's relationship was the sickest thing I have ever read in my entire life. Anne needed to be seen as desirable by every man including her brother, and they couldn't decide whether they wanted to be siblings or lovers. They spent the book giving long desiring looks at each other, kissing, touching, and at one point, naive little Mary leaves them alone together...in bed. She is completely fascinated by all this and it isn't until they are arrested when their supposed incest comes to light and she realizes the deformed baby Anne gave birth too wasn't the king's, but George's. Even if Anne needed a son that badly, she didn't have to jump into bed with her brother. I'm sure other men were probably willing. Ugh, and speaking for someone who has a brother, I need to go vomit...Every character in this book was annoying and one dimensional. Anne was dark and evil. Mary was light and good. Henry was a fat selfish horndog who passed a new law every five minutes to satisfy his needs. Jane Parker was described as having a sly smile every two pages. Katherine of Aragon was a saint as was Jane Seymour. The Boleyn/Howard family were unfeeling villains who pimped out their daughters/nieces left and right, and didn't care who was in bed with the king. The only characters I liked were George (until he became all incestous with Anne), William Carey, and William Stafford. I have no idea what the latter two saw in my biggest problem with the novel: Mary Boleyn herself...Mary was the most naive, insipid character I have ever had the misfortune to write about. She spends the whole book never believing anything bad will happen: the king won't tire of me, the Duke of Buckingham won't be executed, Bishop Fisher and More won't be executed, Anne and George won't be executed...I wanted to slap the girl and bring her out of her little dreamland. I would have thought that she would have grown out of her naivete as she grew older, but she did not. She is also depicted as not being very bright as almost everyone has to explain to her (like a child) what is going on, because she doesn't understand crap.And she's such a little hypocrite. She scolds her uncle and Anne for scheming against Katherine of Aragon who she admires so much, but Mary herself never passes up the chance to betray KOA herself. Yes, most of the time her family members were the masterminds, but the thing with the oranges and the letter from her aunt was all her. No one was watching her to she what she would do, but because she wanted to do something to be praised by her family, she gives what was probably the only message of hope the Queen ever received to her uncle. Also, while she had no choice but to become the king's mistress, she didn't exactly shy away from it either. One second she feels guilty, and the next, \\"Oh, I'm so in love with the king and he loves me too...{sigh}.\\" (And I doubt Katherine of Aragon would giggle with Mary Boleyn over something Anne said on her way to gaining the king.)There were only a few historical inaccuracies that were jarring: Henry VIII never went to any executions, especially not Buckingham's. Henry was, despite everything, a sentimental man, and probably could not have stood it. Mary Boleyn, after being exiled when she married William Stafford, did not become a happy farm wife. She wrote Anne and the king to help her out so much Henry got annoyed, practically telling her to stop writing. Because of this, Anne technically did have Mary's son become her ward, but not for selfish reasons. In fact, that was a huge plot hole in the novel. Anne went through so much trouble to steal Mary's son, but she never uses him when she needs to, especially after her miscarriages.The Other Boleyn Girl, though an intriguing read, was kind of a train wreck, and it's pretty easy to say that I won't be re-reading it any time soon."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"II will admit first of all that I did not finish this book. I had never read a book by Philippa Gregory and since I like historical fiction I thought I would give her books a try. I have never been a fan of romance so that might be why I found this book light on the history and heavy on the romance. It was just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Sister rivalry. It's a common concept found in many stories, but not always necessarily found in historical fiction novels. Almost all historical fiction novels focus around a key historical figure. If focused around England during the Renaissance, the historical figures usually include one of the Tudors, maybe even one of the many ex-wives of King Henry VIII. Philippa Gregory takes a different path than most historical fiction writers as she tells a memorable tale of the life of the sister of one of the ex-wives. The Other Boleyn Girl is a must-read for fans of historical fiction. It exploits the behind-the-scene story of how King Henry VIII embarked on a civil revolution, just to marry mistress Ann Boleyn, told through the eyes of her younger sister and the King's previous mistress, Mary Boleyn. Mary's story is enticing. She was thrown into marriage and into the King's court when she was emerging into her adolescent years. She catches the King eye and is pushed by her family into his bed, fathering two of his children. As the King's desire for her wanes, her older sister (who has been competing with her for everyone's favor since they were young children) distracts the King and makes him fall in love with her. Mary suddenly has to become her older sister's servant and has to give up her children and any chance of love to help forge a path for her sister's chance at royalty. This enlightened outlook of what happened during this time period shows how ambition leads to downfall. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been interested in the Tudor history or just loves to read. It's guaranteed to keep you wanting more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Ms. Gregory's interpretation of what it might have been like in the 1500's, living as the Boleyn girls in the court of Henry VIII is interesting reading, historically acurate or not.We can't possibly know what sort of conversations were had and exactly how lives were played out at that time, but it seems that Ms. Gregory took the history books and all the facts well-known, and set to creating her own story-behind-the-story. It is a work of FICTION built upon known information and expanded to fill in what MIGHT have been going on while history was in the making.This story is based upon real people in real situations and the story line that Ms. Gregory developed is what makes the historical facts come to life. Between those facts were situations of REAL LIFE and though I am not sure that each of the characters were represented accurately (as, again, we cannot know their true personalities) they would most likely be similar to how they have been portrayed based on the results we know to be true.In any case, I learned a great deal about the lifestyles, difficulties and ambitions of the people of that time period and I think I got a true sense of what the BOLELYN'S lives were probably like...and the lives of ALL those living in the 1500's.The book did seem a bit long-winded, but in that way it did give a sense of how long and tedious a journey it was through time.In the end, the story left me more interested in the rest of English history...wondering what became of the children, how Henry moved on after Anne's beheading, etc. I realized I knew little about the line to the throne and Ms. Gregory stimulated that interest, as she probably will for any reader of this book.Find out about the little known REST OF THE STORY, the Other Boleyn Girl and their brother, as well as other assorted other historical doings and get a taste of history that may lead you to wanting to know more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is an unbelievable! Telling of the competition between the two Boleyn girls, Anne and Mary. This book contained such intense detail and wonderful imagery I couldn't put it down! It is a fairy-tale in setting and a detestation battle, involving one of the more powerful families in Tudor England. The character profiles were perfect: I was completely able to imagine Mary, Henry, William and Anne sitting by my side. As an avid fan of historical fiction, Philippa Gregory captivated my mind. I continue to turn to the book and re-read passages. The fabulous literary style that Gregory drew into this book is unequaled and unmatched. Very few books I have read can rival this fabulous account of adoration, emotions, animosity, deception and enjoyment.

Not only does shy Mary Anne Spier defend herself from a school snob, we also see her slowly becoming more of a typical young adult in the story. (moodiness, anger, feeling lost and alone and sneeking out of the house are a few examples)Mary Anne goes through many identity changes in the book, as if she wants to try on different personalities.In the BSC stories you always saw Mary Anne wring her hands, cry, or just not say anything when someone made fun or embarassed her. Or she'd wait for her friends to come rescue her. In the Friends Forever stories, readers can see that Mary Anne is coming out of her shell forever.

I love the fact that Mary Anne has changed and will now stand up for herself, instead of waiting for her friends to stick up for her. I mean, if she were to get in a big fight with her friends like back in book 4 of the original BSC, what would she have done?...Until now! Now, Mary Anne will stand up to the meanest girl, or person, in all of SMS. I think that Ms. Martin has done a great job changing Mary Anne's personality. She hasn't changed her too much, but she hasn't changed her for the worst, either. I love how she has made Mary Anne deal with her break-up with Logan. It definitly seems real, especially for a sensitive person like Mary Anne. I went through a similar situation last year, and I know how hard it is to see your ex with another girl, especially when you are still good friends. I'm definitly gonna keep getting this series!

The school nominated categories are being updated this year- so in addition to all the categories like best dressed and most likely to succeed, they have other categories like Most Artistic and Most Likely to Be Seen in Hollywood. Cokie, unfortunately, sabotages the votes so that she and her friends will get all the categories to themselves. Mary Anne and Abby figure this out, though, and go to the vice-principal to get a recount.Cokie, furious (as always), spreads a rumor around the school that Mary Anne begged Logan to take her back, sending him e-mail messages and hundreds of messages on his answering machines. Logan, reportedly, had said 'no, there is another girl, and I don't like you any more'. This isn't true, and Mary Anne and the BSC get Cary Retlin to help them think up a way to pay her back just in time for the huge party that Cokie's throwing.Mary Anne's dad grounds Mary Anne just before the party, so Mary Anne sneaks out and arrives there, where she tells the truth to Cokie once and for all- that Cokie's a brat that no one likes and that even though she thinks that telling lies about other people will make her seem cool, they don't.Mary Anne finally gets over her nightmares, and learns that her dad had recently been experiencing the same flashbacks to the night of the fire.A good book, and a lot more serious and realistic than the original BSC series."},{"Title":"Mary Anne's Revenge (Baby-Sitters Club Friends Forever)","review":"Here's the deal.

Cokie is in charge, and she's most enthusiastic about the parts like &quot;Most sporty&quot;, &quot;Most likely to be seen in Beverly Hills&quot;, etc. Cokie is convinced that she fits in most of this categories, and is being mean to MaryAnne, spreading rumours and everything.MaryAnne teams up (sort of) with Cary Retlin to get her revenge on Cokie.

Hugh Bennett, a reporter of the local Gazette, is on his way to Far Werther to write a piece on these celebrations. In the tumult of fireworks he witnesses what seems at first a silly prank of some youngsters on bikes. But when the smoke clears it turns out that this group of boys was not into playing: they were 'deadly' serious. A man stabbed with an unseen ferocity is the only real evidence that is left. A lot of witnesses say that they have seen the boys attack the guy, but Hugh Bennett is convinced that no-one was able to see anything in that dark and smoky night. He starts his own investigations.The Progress of a Crime is an intriguing story that focuses more than any other whodunit on the moral site of crime solving. Julian Symons neglects -clearly on purpose- the question of who the real murderer is. Instead he focuses on who the papers want to be the \`ideal' murderer. The difference between journalists and advocates becomes quite small when both their wages depend on the outcome of the trial. Although the subject has certain originality to it, Julian Symons does not succeed in keeping it always as fresh throughout the novel. Although the strong characterisation gives the story a strong feel of realism, at a certain point the reader needs to get some hints as to the identity of the perpetrator. When this information is lacking you loose interest very quickly.If you are looking for some surprising denouement skip this one and read some Agatha Christie mysteries for example."},{"Title":"Holly Pond Hill Advent Calendar","review":"The lovely watercolor print shows a pond skating scene, full of Holly Pond Hill bunnies in their victorian costumes.

Basically, as an atlas of anatomy, it wasn't so great, but as an encyclopedia of pathways, it was well worthwhile. I found that the black and white photos obscured details and lacked much of the contrast that I saw in the lab. Also, it was hard to find representative pictures of some of the structures reviewed in the class in this atlas. They were mostly all in the book, but not necessarily in a photograph that showed them in the most meaningful way. Structures might be shown in a close-up cross section, for example, when actually understanding their three-dimensional path might be better represented by a different dissection, from another angle, or in a Netter-style illustration. The Pal-Weigert stained slides in the book were also kind of hard to decode, as the slides themselves weren't labelled. Instead, there was a labelled illustrated version of the slides on an adjacent page, which sometimes made it difficult to correlate the labels on the illustrations with the structures on the photographic slide.On the other hand, the pathways in the back of the book were great, as were the blank pathway diagrams which were provided for the student to xerox and fill in. That made it easy to practice drawing the pathways over and over again until they were firmly ingrained in my brain."},{"Title":"Neuroanatomy: An Atlas of Structures, Sections and Systems","review":"I used this book for my first neuroanatomy course, and it was an excellent tool to guide me though the class. It was especially useful for identification of structures and paths for the lab portion of the class, but was also helpful for the lecture segment.

I enjoyed it a lot!First, I enjoyed it because it had a lot of music and instruments in it. There were two main violinists in it and their names were Violet and Melody. Also the violin is one of my favorite instruments, partly because I play it. Two of the songs that Violet played for Melody were songs that I can play on the violin also.Second, I liked it because it had a great mystery in it. Someone stole the original Mozart. There were a lot of suspects like Melody, Janet Muller, a man in a black suit, and Bob Weldon. Who stole the original Mozart?

It seems that novices who've only seen one or two quantum physics texts in their lives fall for the smooth talking style of Griffiths. Don't fall for it! For example, the section on angular momentum and spin is one of the worst I've ever read. Griffiths gets the reader lost in a heap of math without taking the time to describe the picture behind it. (I'm not complaining about the level of math in the book, but his failure in communicating the physical insight or feeling of quantum phenomena.)Even the small book by Paul Davies is better written and more insightful than Griffiths.My personal recommendations are the Feynman Lectures on Physics (volume III) and Introduction to the Quantum Theory by David Park (even Griffiths acknowledges in his own text that Park is an excellent book). After these two you may want to hit Shankar or Sakurai. (As I said above, the book by Davies is pretty good too.)"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"If you are like many beginning chemistry/physics students and you feel intimidated by QM you will love this book.

He has a conversational style (also evident in his EM text) that elucidates many of the hard-to-visualize concepts in QM. However, he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems. If the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved, it leads to frustration. I recommend Griffiths' text as the main book in a QM course only if it is supplemented with additional hints (from the professor) on the problems, or with an additional text such as Shankar's or the Eisberg and Resnick work."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Simply the best, using plain English!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Most QM books have the same material and present them in the same way: equations, equations, equations. What sets apart Griffith's book is his attempt to show the underlying concepts under the equations, in plain english. His review of probability, his philosophical discussions on what exactly some parts of QM mean, were incredibly helpful in understanding the equations and putting them in a larger context. Too many QM books lack this explanation; Griffith does it with style. Although you may need another QM book for breadth, this book is definately an useful and important addition to learning QM."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is the best undergraduate quantum mechanics book I have ever read. Every undergraduate program should be using this book, the other books I've seen don't even come close. That includes Liboff, Goswami, and Greiner.I even think this book is worth a read after going through Cohen-Tannoudji. While the other books leave the student confused, with their heads spinning, Griffiths uses his excellent ability to explain things to provide as clear an introduction to the subject you could imagine. I disagree with the other reviewers, the notion that Davies book is better is absurd. As far as the problems with the examples, I think Griffiths approach is a good one."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I read all sorts of math and physics books. I majored in math and like to keep the math parts of my brain working, even though my on-the-job application of mathematics consists of the operators +-/* Griffiths book is a gem for a person like me. I have been able to work through the entire thing by myself and I believe this has a lot to do with his style. He leaves out enough steps that you find yourself making marginal annotations that make you feel as if you're part of the whole learning process. He uses foreshadowing beautifully, to the point where I found that I was \\"like a kid at Christmas,\\" picking at the corners of the wrapped presents under the tree: I researched, bought other books, surfed the web, heck - I even found myself in Berkeley's Physics Library!If you want a dry, poorly written and edited tome, by all means, buy Sakurai (yes, I've read it, too). But if you want a book that either answers all the fundamental QM questions, keeps you interested and engaged, and - perhaps most important of all - sparks your curiosity to drive your research forward, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I used this book in an introductory quantum class last semester, and found it to be a well-written, easy-to-read, and, perhaps most importantly, lively text. Griffiths deserves to be described by the old term for physicist: &quot;natural philosopher.&quot; He makes sure to explain concepts using logical, physical arguments and reviews most of the relevant math needed to understand the physics. It's something of a letdown, then, that many of the problems are mere mathematical exercises in tedium. There are many good problems, however, and, on the whole, it's a great book, especially if you've seen quantum a little before, as I had."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is the best first course quantum mechanics text book by far. I used it as a text in first semester QM. How do I know it is the best? During first semester qm I spent many hours in the school library reading qm books. The library had a large section of qm books. I used to take 10 to 20 books home at a time. I was always looking for better explanations of particular expositions, and I found that often one book gave the clearest exposition in a particular area. Also, Ifound it helpful to read how several books described, for example, solution to the step function and others. But David Griffiths book is the best written book of all those others I read.The Griffiths book is easy to understand. That is what makes it a good book for the beginning student of qm. Let me give an example of what I am saying: Fourty five years ago, when I first studied calculus, there was only one text book. It was the then venerable Calculus and Analytic Geometry by George Thomas, Jr. This book was not easy to study. It is not a well written book compared to modern calculus text books. But now there are many good calculus text books. Now calculus is a fairly easy subject because the text books are well written. They are student friendly. I think that most qm books are like the Thomas book in that they are not student friendly, and the Griffiths book is the first student friendly qm book in my view.The one criticism that students might have of the Griffiths books is that the problems are long and time consuming. This is true if you do not use Mathematica or some other math program. If you use Mathematica, the problems can be worked in minutes.The Griffiths book uses wave mechanics notation throughout, which every physicist must learn. To learn the Dirac notation, the best book I found (and the most elegant qm book I found) is Quantum Mechanics, by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, and Franck Laloe."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I used this book for a self-study of QM. While it jumps right into the material, it fails to give an intuitive basis for much of what it is covering. I highly recommend Michael Morrison's &quot;Understanding Quantum Physics: A User's Manual&quot; as a supplement. Additionally, I don't think Griffiths is correct in postpoining the formal mathematical formulation of QM (i.e. Dirac bra/ket notation, etc.) He glosses over these topics, and he should treat them more in detail earlier in the text so that when a reader sees them in higher level books the transition will be easier."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I have read both the EM and QM books by Griffiths.

It is what the title says it is: an introductory text for the people that is curious about QM. Griffths does not avoid the controversial issues on the physical interpretation of the theory ( a part of the book that should have appeal even to the non-technical reader ). His treatment of the topics is always illuminating and gives the reader a sensation of understanding what he/she is being told.Maybe Professor Griffths would consider next an up-to-date and extended edition of his Elementary Particle book and/or a new text on Quantum Field Theory."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is a great intro quantum book, perfect for a year long course at the junior/senior level. The text is wonderful to read, very helpful, and quite humorous. Some of the problems are definitely very repetitive, but I suppose they do serve a purpose (you'll never forget how to calculate commutators after Ch 4). My only complaint is the lack of mathematical theory (ie- Hilbert space!) but that's easily remedied with a few supplementary readings. Overall, a wonderful book, I highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"There a several things I have come to dislike about this book. The first is in the overall treatment of the subject matter. The explanations are incomplete and sometimes you can be left wondering how one equation follows from another. Griffiths also introduces symbols or notations without giving a formal definition of what it is. As a result of this, reading the actual text is usually of no help when it comes to solving the more difficult problems. It is infuriating to look at a problem for over three hours and still have absolutely no clue as to how to go about solving it. I have no problem with very difficult problems that take hours, but I would like to spend the time actually working on the problem, instead of staring at it, wondering where to start or what that notation means that the author never defined. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Excellent for the mathematically inclined student of physics. It's large collection of problems makes it ideal for self-study"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"The book has a few good parts, but there are just too many flaws to grant anything higher than one star. Griffiths leaves many important steps out, sometimes leaving them to the problems or just not covering them at all. Some topics are covered too briefly to be of any help.This book seems to be popular among some students because of his informal writing style, but they should be more cautious. Many professionals I have talked to agree that this is not a good book to start learning QM from.

With that said, I think his E+M book is the worst, then the QM book, and finally the particles book is the most well-written. Since this is a review about his QM book, I'm going to focus on that. I really found this book nice at first, but the exercises soon got so tedious I got sick of it. Studying for exams was tough, since the book does not provide answers for most of the questions. (He only provides answers to the most difficult problems, which are unlikely to ever appear on any exam. And by difficult, I often mean algebraically difficult, not conceptually or otherwise.) As for his writing style, it gets old real quick. By the third or fourth chapter you start noticing how many times he uses italics to emphasize certain points. It loses its point after a while. And soon you realize how, by having about three or four footnotes per page really, and I mean really, slows down the flow of the argument. I can see why people may like this book, but Griffiths is really too unrigorous for my liking.

Certain topics are not discussed in detail and there are some topics that are not discussed at all. Where is the background information? This book needs to be discontinued!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This text is much like Griffith's intro to electrodynamics. If you don't need to learn anything, and just want a simple answer to basic questions, buy this book. If, however, you are taking a class in quantum mechanics, don't waste your money. Griffith brings up interesting questions without ever answering them. He offers no assistance in solving the more demanding problems which would aid the learning process. If you're majoring in physics stay away from Griffith as a whole. Rholf is a much better publisher and writer. Check out his texts if you're serious about an education."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"The text is clear and concise -- its very easy to follow, since it doesn't have tons of text in between the equations. My main complaint is the problems -- they focus too much on boring, repetitive calculations that are not very instructive (For example, one part of one problem in chapter 4 required me to take 63 derivatives). If a problem asks you to verify something as trivial as normalization, beware! But still, the text more than makes up for it. Plus, its a very nice size to carry around."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"While the overall tone of this book is quite engaging, the major flaws are a lack of examples (Dr. Griffiths enjoys having the student figure out things on their own without them) and no answer key."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"To all of you undergraduate students out there with this as your introductory text on quantum mechanics, bewarned that you may end up like the little kitty that appears playful on the front, but dead or really tired on the back by the time that you finish this course.

I dearly love the book, but I just don't like the problems. Instead of being concept oriented, they're &quot;math-trick&quot; oriented. His examples definitely enrich the concepts, but the problems are 1% concept; 97% math; and 2% obscure &quot;math-tricks&quot;. He stated in the E$M book that he doesn't believe in giving answers. Well, I disagree. You have to have occassional answers to make sure you're on the right track. After all, WE are LEARNING; not TEACHING! THANX"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"At first, the easy going style appealed to me. When I began reading other texts, such as Liboff's excellent 'Introductory Quantum Mechanics', I realized the shortcomings of Griffiths. The maturity level of the book is horribly inconsistent. For instance, there is NO formalism presented regarding representations of operators or on the ideas of an abstract Hilbert Space. But when it comes to scattering, he uses contour integration, an approach not even used in the more formal Cohen-Tannoudji text. It is interesting to also note how Griffiths wastes an entire chapter on the variational principle (a subject left as an exercise in Liboff).It should be noted that a student should learn, at some point in his/her undergraduate career, how to read more formal material so as to have more difficult subject matter accesible in further study. Griffiths book does not accomplish this goal as a student who has had only this as a foundation would be at a serious disadvantage when confronted with standard texts in relativistic quantum mechanics or quantum field theory. A first course would be much better off with Liboff augmented with Feynman's third volume and perhaps some Cohen-Tannoudji. Griffiths would make good bathroom reading."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I used this text exclusively to study for the GRE, and have used it as a reference in grad school in all kinds of contexts. While it lacks the number of problems and depth of some of the other basic QM books, in terms of clarity it is unparalleled(I am comparing it to B&amp;J, Schiff, Eisberg, and Landau and Lifschitz here). The only QM book that I have seen that rivals this in readability and clarity is Sakurai."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is definitely the best physics text I have used, with only Griffiths's own Classical Electrodynamics text comparing. The style is very readable, and the equations to words ratio is quite nice (not too verbose but enough explanation along with the equations).

I have found its coverage of topics to be quite good and it has been extremely helpful in my advanced quantum mechanics class."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"It is well explained and written in a language that most university-level students are able to comprehend. There are plenty examples to illustrate problems and theories. Suitable for junior and senior physics or science studnets."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Let me begin by saying that it would be a mistake to learn from Griffiths, for the simple reason he sticks to the coordinate representation without exploiting the bra-ket formalism. This is akin to studying electromagnetism without using vector analysis (or more advanced methods), like early 20th century texts taught it. This alone makes the book a bad purchase. Another point against buying this book is that it's incomplete and elementary. If you're thinking of pursuing a career in physics you will outgrow it VERY quickly and it will become useless. Your money is better spent on more encyclopedic (albeit dry) texts such as Messiah or Cohen-Tannoudji, or on slightly more advanced texts, such as Shankar's excellent (introductory, too!) book. These will serve you in years to come, even through your PhD and afterwards. That being said, I did not find anything particularly bad or good about this book. Griffiths style is nice, but style doesn't sell physics books. There are dozens of books on QM and it seems a bit strange to me that people still keep on writing books on this subject. I did not personally try the problems - you don't buy books for problems, you buy books to learn about physics. If you want problems with solutions, try the excellent and comprehensive &quot;Problems and solutions on quantum mechanics&quot;, edited by Lim Yung-kuo -it doesn't cost as much as Griffiths and will be MUCH much more effective for learning problem solving skills! (also there's a 90% chance you'll find your homework problems in there ... ;-))"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This book is one of the worst texts I have read on the subject of Quantum Mechanics. Griffiths presents the subject in a glib manner presenting the easiest of material in the chapter and leaving the student to drown in problems without a clue of how to proceed. If you ever need to teach yourself Quantum Mechanics, Use the Feynman Lectures."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This introductory text by Griffiths has two major advantages: first it is exceedingly interesting to read, at such an extent one could believe the material is easy. Exercises are challenging enough to show it is just an impression. Second, the text covers a rather big amount of the (non-relativistic) theory, in a concision which is exemplar. It is a short text, which travels in the corners of the field: quantum statistics, solid state physics, perturbation theories, scattering... Of course the counterpart is those topics aren't dealt with at depth. This is a book to see things, before to work on them. For all those reasons, it is a very, very bad reference, but it is not its purpose. For example, the bra and ket formalism is introduced a bit lately, and its use is not stressed. The functional notation for what is currently referred to as |n, l, m&gt; conceals the power of Dirac notations. Tensor product of Hilbert space are completely omitted, thus obscuring the (short but important) section on angular momenta, especially their addition. However, following the book's spirit, you have an opportunity to see Clebsch-Gordan coefficients at work, with their pretty cascading tables.The book is accessible without serious prerequisites, not even in electromagnetism, you just need to know the basis of calculus. Therefore it is the text to get if as a beginner you want to get acquainted with this fundamental piece of physics, along with learning your first physical theories (mechanics or electromagnetism). For others, it is useless to they who ever know pretty much of the theory, even as a review. To students who encounter this strange world for the first time, but with a fierce amount of classical knowledge on their back, I recommend it either as a companion to a more demanding detailed text--Shankar seeming the perfect pick--or as the only text if tremendous amount of personal work is to be furnished to fill in and explore by oneself what is missing. I wouldn't rely too much on it however."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I had previously written a review of this text based upon my experiences with it first semester, dealing mostly with chapters 1-4. Upon further reading of the book and comparison to various other texts (the Baym, Sakurai and Shankar, specifically), I have decided that I need to rewrite my review.First off, the good side: If you're interested in a wave mechanics approach to learning quantum mechanics, this book isn't horrible. You certainly learn a lot about solving differential equations, although you are never asked to solve any yourself. Also, the problems for the students to work range from the insanely trivial to the intriguingly difficult. Now for the bad part...Well, the problem with those worked problems is that there is a lot of important stuff in the problems, and Griffiths assumes you have worked every single problem. This wouldn't be an issue, except most of the chapters have over 50 problems, and the odds that you did the right problem you need when he references that problem three chapters later is pretty slim.Also, he does not introduce you to the Dirac notation or the linear algebra approach to quantum mechanics until the third chapter, after which he promptly discards that powerful tool in favor of the way he had been going, which is with wave mechanics. So he deprives the readers of knowledge of a remarkably useful language to discuss quantum mechanics.He begins with the Schrodinger equation, without any motivation at all, and proceeds from there. He could start out talking about two level systems, the collapse of the state vector, eigenvalue measurements and all that long before getting into infinite-dimensional systems, but he seems to think that solving a differential equation without explaining what the Schrodinger equation actually is (the Hamiltonian operator) or giving any idea of its physical significance.Some problems are absurdly ambiguous to the point that you really wonder what exactly you're supposed to do, and the working of nontrivial examples is few and far between (with exceptions being the hydrogen atom and the raising and lowering operators for the various applications of those).Because I don't want to conclude being completely negative, I would like to point out that the sections on approximation methods are very good and easy to follow.I think everyone else put it best when they said that this is quantum mechanics for those with no mathematical inclination, and if you are a physics major with no mathematical inclination, I have to question your choice of study. For those serious about learning quantum mechanics, purchase the Shankar, it's cheaper and much more fulfilling."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is a well-written, beautifully done text for beginners. Though not a brilliant book like Dicke-Wittke (which sparked at every page and, alas, is out-of-print), it brings the message. Besides the more usual topics, I particularly liked the treatment of adiabatic processes and the Berry phase, which is the best I met in textbooks. The exercises are effective, and vary from routine to tough. I've met at least one which slightly strains, in its wording, the laws of electromagnetism. But I liked to teach from it, and, better, the students loved it. I wish I had a text like this when I fought against old Schiff, centuries ago!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Griffiths treads an unconventional, good-humored path in this book. Instead of starting, as many introductions to quantum mechanics do, with historical interpretations that lead up to the particle-wave equation, he jumps head-first into problems and examples. This text would be very difficult to tackle alone, but under the tutelage of a good instructor (to help with problems that could very well take all day) is well worth the effort. He never goes too deep, and comes closest to the median, that is, he writes at a level understandable to undergraduates. My biggest vice is his lack of physical or experimental examples; they seem to be an addendum to the mathematics. Also, it sticks to the Schrodinger interpretation nearly throughout, which I think is preferable as an intro to QM, but some fancy graduate students might whine (I think one or two problems deals with the Heisenberg/Linear Algebra approach, and some Singlet, Triplet stuff uses matrices, etc. but that's easy). He brings on some fairly traditional problems, so a student who doesn't have a strong math background might want to get another book as a reference. Like the other reviewer said, there are some very algebraically difficult problems that don't really emphasis conceptual understanding, but QM is hard work, so if you wanna get cookin' this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"David Griffiths concentrates on the classic and important QM proplems, such as the Schrodinger equation, the finite square well, the delta function potential, the hydrogen atom, spin, etc. He does not touch on QM &quot;side line&quot; issues. Thus the students efforts are most efficient. Griffiths develops each subject in a balanced and easy to understand way. His book could be home studied without assistance from an instructor, which is certainly not true of many QM texts. The exercises are well selected and appropriate, and many of them have implicit or explicit answers provided. Along with QM by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, I would rate this one of the best choices for the beginning student. While Cohen-Tannoudji is comprehensive and elegant, Griffiths is basic and focused."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This book does what it was designed to do - introduce the reader to quantum mechanics by connecting familiar newtonian mechanics to the strange world of the quantum. At 300 something pages it can't cover everything and smartly doesn't try. It gives lots of pointers to more advanced material and hints at features and concepts that are not covered.It has 2 failings as a classroom text. The dearth of examples and the expectation that you will read through *Every* problem whether assigned or not. A motivated teacher can fix this by pointing out those keys concepts and formula that are buried in the problems. But not all teachers are caring or capable.The book really falls down as a self-study text. There are no solutions to the problems so you have absolutely no feedback as to whether you are learning anything or not. The problems also take huge leaps from trivial to nearly impossible without help and the one,two or three stars are not a reliable guide.My teacher tried to supplement the book with reading from Cohen-Tannoudji but that just lost us all in the notation, unfamiliar style and equations referenced from sections, which wouldn't happen if we actually used the entire book.Griffiths writes well and nearly always explains what he choses to say clearly but doesn't always say enough even for a good student. He needs to add about 50 pages of worked examples and a partial answer to all the key problems. When my teacher gave partial answers the book was 200% more effective but he only did so 20% of the time (teachers are busy you know)."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This book is a solid introduction to quantum mechanics, although Griffiths sometimes gets caught up in verbal and notational wizardry. The style is light and easy-going, unlike some earlier books on the subject. Griffiths also, not with unlimited success, attempts explain the physical intuition behind QM. However, a caveat to the reader: not all problems in the book are created equal. In my seminar-like class, some problems took five minutes to solve, while on others, the whole class spent a week on."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I've been using this book as the text for my undergraduate quantum course for several years. It is far superior to the books I used ~25 years ago when I first studied quantum as an undergrad.Griffiths' strategy of using chapters1&amp;2 to review probility and make student's comfortable with the mathematical machinery of QM, then reviewing Linear Algebra leading up to Hilbert spaces in Chapter 3, before starting anew with the postulates of QM makes a lot of pedagogical success. Typically, at least half my undergrad students need the math review. All of them have seen Shroedinger's Eq in a Modern Physics class that comes before QM, but without much motivation. I find Griffiths' motivation of the postulates far more intuitive than the more common &quot;let's see what properties a QM wave equation-equivalent might have&quot; approach. Other texts tend to give the axioms short shrift, but not Griffiths.I'm an experimentalist, but I really groove with this book that presents more of a theorists approach. I do find I need to supplement my class lectures with illustrative examples to provide my students with balance, but it would be harder to add the theory into other books which have more examples, but gloss over the theory. This is a physicist's QM book. If you are an engineer or chemist who just wants to learn to do plug and chug problems, look elsewhere.Several ace students (including a former student of mine) complain the book is not sufficiently advanced. If undergrads are ready for Sakurai, and have the sophistication for a higher level approach, all the more power to them! However, the goal of an *undergraduate* text is to prepare students for QM at the level of Sakurai. There is a reason that most undergrad courses don't use graduate texts.The problems are excellent, though most students will find them time consuming. They are an integral part of Griffiths' approach. Former students who have gone on to top-notch grad schools tell me that the doing the HW problems were important for preparing themselves for graduate QM.I know of no better undergrad QM class text, though it may not be the easiest to use for students who wish to learn without the guidance of a professor."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Perhaps people not expecting too much from an introductory text would be satisfied by the treatment of quantum mechanics in this book, but for those who want a no-holds-barred, give-it-all-to-me text that will inspire some thought should look elsewhere. The jokes and the glossing-over of some of the concepts in the book do not help the understanding of a complicated and non-intuitive subject. Another annoying habit of Griffiths is to provide examples as problems: &quot;I'd love to work out an example for you ... Unfortunately, manageable cases are hard to come by, and I want to save the best example for you to work out yourself. Be sure, therefore, to study problem 2.22 with particular care.&quot; (pg. 46-47). I have used two other of his texts, including this one, and he is fairly consistent with his glib treatment of certain subjects.As a text that will give the reader an extremely superficial knowledge of the workings of QM, knowledge of what calculations to perform when asked to find expectation values or angular momentum projections, this text may be adequate. That is NOT to say that those people who like this book are not intelligent; it gets people through. However, if you happen to be a person who likes to know what they're doing when they're performing a calculation, why they are doing it, what the physics underlying the calculations happen to be, and where the technique comes from, then I would suggest that if this text is required for the course you are taking, supplement it with Cohen-Tannoudji, Dirac, J.J. Sakurai, Bransden and Joachain, Messiah, and/or Merzbacher. Please try not to use it as the primary text for an introductory course on QM. You will miss out on the wonderful subleties and quirks of an essential part of any physicist's curriculum and find it harder to catch up on it later if you decide to pursue the subject further."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is a good place to start studying QM after being introduced to some basic quantum physics from a modern physics text such as Serway or Eisberg and Resnick. I especially like the treatment of the uncertainty principle done in this text and many of the side comments made are very interesting. It is not perfect however, as there are no solutions to problems and some of the later chapters have errors. You can download an errata list at the author's web site though and many of the problems are the types that you can be fairly certain if you have the right answer or not. If you want to just read it and not work many problems it can get a little annoying because in deriving some results Griffiths will often say something like &quot;and because of the theorem you proved in problem 2.4, we see that...&quot; This book is also a bit overpriced in my mind, but so are almost all of the serious intro QM texts. I've seen other reviewers saying that Griffiths is not very rigorous and I believe that these reviewers must be either mathematicians or people who already knew the subject before reading the book. It is fine on the rigor for an intro text in my mind and since it is a standard QM text in many undergraduate physics programs it looks as though some people agree with me. In many ways I like Liboff better than this text, yet Griffiths is better than Liboff in many ways also. Two two texts complement each other yet put a dent in your wallet. If only Dover could get ahold of the two!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I would have given this book a higher rating, but the problems are often too tedious. Griffiths introduces too many important techniques and derivations in the problem sets instead of in the text--which is a shame, since he writes so well. Students may understand every word Griffiths has written, only to get stuck on any of a number of problems requiring special &quot;math tricks.&quot; Since few examples and no solutions are provided, this can be very frustrating. Some good students in my undergraduate quantum class dropped, and those that stayed complained daily about the problems. Several felt the need to consult other textbooks."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I presume the conversational tone of this text makes it appealing to many people; I found it annoying after a while, and I think he uses it to avoid details in many derivations. The notation is not used consistently, the powerful algebraic principles behind QM are introduced in the third chapter and then hardly used again, and likewise the text relies rather heavily on the coordinate representation and on classical arguments. The greatest shortcoming of the text is its brevity: the descriptions of several topics, including matrix mechanics, scattering, and applications, are incomplete, while other topics, such as the Heisenberg representation and the density matrix, are missing entirely. For an undergraduate course, I recommend Liboff, who I think is clearer, more comprehensive, and features some extra goodies such as a brief introduction to the Dirac and Klein Gordon equations."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I have come to appreciate the style of Griffiths over the past few years. I first had his E&amp;M text as an undergraduate and I was grateful for it's simplicity. I now use the Griffiths E&amp;M text to augment my graduate E&amp;M text by Jackson. This is why Griffiths is a good author. He introduces the subject in a clear and concise manner for the purpose of giving the student a solid background.I used Griffith's introductory quantum text when I first came to graduate school. I had not yet taken quantum and so I enrolled in the undergraduate course to give myself sufficient background. Now I am taking a graduate course using Merzbacher's text, which is also a good text, and Griffith's text is the perfect companion.The truth is that no textbook in quantum is completely sufficient for providing a solid background on the subject. The field is relatively new in the realm of physics and I seriously doubt that there are many people on the planet who can say (without their perception clouded by dellusion or arrogance) that they have totally grasped all concepts in the field of quantum physics. One must evolve into a better physicist, and in understanding this very fundamental principle, one can understand that one must start small and eventually progress to bigger things. Griffiths has written a text for those who are taking small or medium sized steps who eventually hope to grasp the concepts introduced in more advanced texts."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"I hate books which put things more difficult than they really are. This is not such a book.

Quantum by the numbers, turn the math handle and crank out the answers.

If putting a dead pet on the back cover is friendly, this book is friendly!Goswami's book (now sadly out of print) is much better on motivation, and desn't do as much grind-math. I wish there were a book on Quantum that would break the mold and try to be interesting for today's students, and not just churn out the same old calculations on the same old systems (harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, blah-blah). It could have sections on quantum computing, laser trapping... This is not that book."},{"Title":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Don't be fooled by the informal style of this text. Griffiths has a bad habit of leaving many important results to the exercises, and he also briskly jumps over many difficult steps. He doesn't even provide a plausability argument for the Schroedinger equation (I know it's not necessary, but it wouldn't hurt to provide the steps how Schroedinger arrived at his famous equation).His exercises are very lousy and have little effect in reinforcing the material. A much better book is &lt;I&gt;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&lt;/I&gt; by Shankar or &lt;I&gt;Quantum Mechanics&lt;/I&gt; by Cohen-Tannoudji.In short, Griffiths' text has too many holes.

He goes into explanation of various rites in some detail with beautiful visual descriptions including color and imagry. He covers masonic groups from various countries and explains their connections. Taking us as far back as the connection to the mystic rites of the pyramids of Egypt and beyond. This book left me with a new understanding of the purpose of the masons as people pledged to bring light into the world."},{"Title":"FREEMASONRY AND ITS ANCIENT MYSTIC RITES","review":"The original title to this classic work was \\"Glimpses of Masonic History.\\" This showed the author's purpose to demonstrate a direct connection between modern masonry and the ancient mystery religions. How well he made this case is up to the reader to decide. Personally, it is obvious to me that there is a golden thread connecting the traditions. This is most obvious at the level of the Occult School (as opposed to the \\"Authentic\\", Anthropological\\", and \\"Mystical\\" Schools.)Leadbeater showed a remarkable knowledge of the Egyptian, Cretan, Jewish, Greek, and Mithraic mysteries. This is knowledge based not merely on a deep familiarity with ancient written source works and archeological finds, but on the unconventional knowing of the clairvoyant. Leadbeater was considered one of the most distinguished clairvoyants of his day. You will find much here that is not included in more \\"scholarly\\" works. Needless to say, such knowledge is not varifiable to the satisfaction of most of the scientific establishment. Yet, this is not to say that it is in error.The second half of the book covers the operative masonry of Medieval Times, and then the more traditional history of speculative masonry in the early 17th century. It ends with an examination of the Co-Masonic Order (a more metaphysical branch of masonry closely associated with the Theosophical Society, and which accepts both men and women.)Transmutemini, Transmutemini De Lapidibus Mortuis In Lapides Vivos Philosophicos."},{"Title":"FREEMASONRY AND ITS ANCIENT MYSTIC RITES","review":"There is a lot of information in this book.The nature of Freemasonry makes proving or disproving the authors ideas impossible.I am not a Freemason.My interest in the subject relates to the \\"Jewish Mysteries\\" and ties to King Solomon and other Hebrew people.Afer reading this book Ifeel that King Solomon was influential on Freemasonry.I strongly disagree that Yehusha(Christ)participated in these secret societies.Some of the rites do mimic the crucifixion and resurrection.Which I find interesting.Mr.Leadbetter puts forth an interesting theory of who Hiram Abiff was.Was he in the Bible?He states that the death of Hiram Abiff was not as portrayed in masonic legend.He was a decorator rather than an architect.The masonic concept of the \\"trinity\\" of Osiris,Isis,and Horus parallels other sun worship cults.I disagree with the author's opinion on the Four Beasts found in Revelation and Ezekiel.He felt that those beasts correlate to four elements/four brothers of Horus.The problem with that is that there is no ape listed in the Four Biblical Beasts.I personally am convinced that the four beasts are related directly to the four brigade emblems of the Israelite tribes.Mr.Leadbetter discussed the double meaning of words,especially regarding \\"The Book of the Dead\\".The date of the \\"mourning the death of Osiris\\" in winter or the \\"slaying of the sun\\" by dark forces are close to those of Christmas celebrations today.Some of the most surprising ideas in this book are:*King Solomon built a temple for Astarte.*In Red Masonry there was a search for a hidden vault buried deep in the Earth in which was hidden the Name of God.*Festivals of two well-known patron saints-St.John the Baptist and St.John the Evangelist were celebrated.*Mention of Jachin and Boaz,the two pillars from Solomon's Temple.*The history and origin of the Knights Templar and their role as financiers.*Mr.Leadbetter wrote about some of the beliefs of early church fathers that if true,are disturbing.This is the second book I have read that makes similar claims of participation in the hidden mysteries.*His theory on the loss of the pronunciation of the sacred Name was wrong in my opinion.He believes that loss was accidental due to memory loss as a result of captivity.I don't believe that the scribes or High Priests ever lost memory of the Name.They hid it.While I don't agree with some of C.W.Leadbetter's theories,this book really does have a lot of history and general information on Freemasonry and related societies.This book provided me with some potential answers that I was looking for.I give it 4 stars for relevant content and readability."},{"Title":"FREEMASONRY AND ITS ANCIENT MYSTIC RITES","review":"I read this book long time ago; I referred to an older edition.This book will be very good for any one whom would like to know about freemasonry in general.

It is useless.Leadbeater didn't seem to know who he was writing for: Masons or public. It couldn't have been for Masons, because it is too inaccurate, incomplete and superficial. It couldn't have been for the public either, because his starting point assumes certain basic knowledge of Masonic terminology and abbreviations.So in my opinion the book serves no purpose. What's more, is that this is obviously some cheap reprint of another title, because there are quite a number of references to nonexistent colour plates, and yet the book is full of spelling mistakes and other typos.My advice would be to stay away from this sad book, as there really is absolutely no reason for it to exist, never mind for you to waste money on. Even a little. Now, if you do want to get under the skin, I suggestMasonry: Beyond the Lightby William Schnoebelen, who has been a senior Mason and satanist for many years, and whose information isn't as outdated as that of Leadbeater."},{"Title":"FREEMASONRY AND ITS ANCIENT MYSTIC RITES","review":"This was purchased as a Christmas present and was very well received.

It is worth a look and makes a good gift."},{"Title":"River","review":"Let me preface this review by indicating I am reviewing this text as an educator and its applications for my students. Debby Atwell in her book, The River, combines simple, yet poignant words with illustrations that look like paintings. The book is about what happens to a river through time. In the beginning the river nourishes and enables the life around it to prosper. As time goes on, people become careless and the river becomes polluted with wastes. People who live in the community by the river set out to change what the river has become to what it once was. Most people in America can relate to this text since we have experienced what has happened in our own communities due to pollution of our rivers and streams. The River gives us all a remarkable message - we all can work together, like people did in the book, to correct the mistakes of the past; i.e., in this case, pollution. I believe that this book can be used as an outstanding vehicle for discussion for Grades 2 - 5. I really enjoyed this book because it teaches children through remarkable illustrations why the pollution occurred."},{"Title":"River","review":"I love how Atwell sees the world from a long term perspective; it did not begin when we did but long, long before us. It will go on long after we are gone. It is up to us to be stewards for all time. Atwell conveys that message nicely in this book."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology Series)","review":"Lynn Phillips has written a marvelously important book! One of the most salient reasons why my young women students reject the label \\"feminist\\" is because they associate it with victimhood. The desire to not be a victim, but to be a powerful agent, is enormously strong among all of us -- but it is particularly pointed among today's college-age women.Phillips bases her book on a series of interviews with an ethnically, culturally, economically and sexually diverse group of female college students. Her book provides extended quotations from these young women on the subject of sexuality, desire, and victimhood. The overriding point is that these young women are forced to embrace some profound contradictions: to be both \\"good girls\\" (demure, pleasing to men and/or families) and \\"together women\\" (in control of their own sexualities, autonomous, and definitely NOT victims).These young women often report longing for emotional intimacy, physical pleasure, and connection -- but the sexual encounters they recount rarely provided that for which they were searching. Despite living in an age of liberation, a generation removed from the 1960s, these young women, according to Phillips, are profoundly ambivalent about their sexual freedom. The ambivalence is rooted in a couple of areas: first, a \\"damned if you do, damned if you don't\\" mentality; they are convinced that no matter what sexual choices they make, they will disappoint someone. Secondly, Phillips notes that these young women often report with pride their \\"mastery of the male body\\". But most are aware that there is a colossal distinction between developing a skill set that enables them to \\"soothe\\" men sexually, and actually enjoying sex with these young men for its own sake.A sure-fire discussion starter, this book is excellent for use in gender studies or sexuality courses."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology Series)","review":"I tend neither to write Amazon reviews nor respond to them, but Siddique's afore posted review is itself 'damaging.' The purpose of the book is not self-help, or to give readers a warm fuzzy feeling- it is but a glimpse into these women's realities.The author does not project *any* blame onto the interviewees. She states explicitly in the second chapter (by means of her discourses) that it is society that puts the onus of victimization on the women. The women are, Phillips argues, trapped in an inescapable cultural system and are socialized to take the blame onto themselves, though in truth are merely products of an unequal environment.If you want a light at the end of a tunnel, there are many books written with the intention of that final \\"feel-good\\" release of dramatic tension. No, this book doesn't have a clean, fix-all solution for the women in this book. What it does have is candid insight into what is a horrifying, silenced reality for many, many, many women in modern society."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology Series)","review":"I read this book to see if it would be appropriate for my Sociology of Gender course. I immediately ordered it. The book is readable (actually, it is more than that, it is masterfully written in clear and powerful language); it is fascinating (including accounts of young women's sexual subjectivities); it is conceptually and theoretically sophisticated and groundbreaking (without being jargony or heavy handed). I am impressed with how it demonstrates the importance of empirical research in illuminating issues confronting feminists. Finally, the author confronts the signficance of the empirical findings (in particcular, that young women's sexual subjectivites reflect the ambiguities, complexities and contradictions of our cultural discourses)for feminist projects of empowering women. She acknowledges the dangers in revealing the messy phenomenology of sex in a world in which both conservative and feminists deal in clear dichotomies of coercion/consent, etc. I eagerly anticipate teaching from this book because it embodies the best in both feminist politics and social science, without compromising either."},{"Title":"Flirting with Danger: Young Women's Reflections on Sexuality and Domination (Qualitative Studies in Psychology Series)","review":"I read this book for a college course years ago and the info really stuck so I wanted to re-read it again.

They are in a double bind with society telling them on the one hand they have individual sexual power and autonomy and on the other hand, men as a group still do not recognise or accept female sexual autonomy. Phillips has researched thoroughly and shows the complex messages young women of all ethnicities still receive concerning their sexuality. A must read for all feminists, women and men too if the sexual double standard is to be challenged."},{"Title":"Folk tales from Korea","review":"I'm Korean-American with a Korean mother, and when I was little, I remember her telling me some crazy stories. They were like the fairy tales I heard in school (I grew up entirely in the US), except they had odd characters doing odd things. At least they seemed odd at the time.In my late twenties, I was browsing through a bookstore in Berkeley that specializes in Asian subjects, and I found this book. I immediately remembered one story that really stuck-out in my memory: one about a frog who ultimately repented for lying to his mother but it was too late and her body wound up floating down a river because of his lies. Like I said, the stories seemed weird at the time :) But sure enough, the story was in the book! Right then and there, I decided to buy it and I read through it pretty quickly.The author traveled all over Korea, noting the origin and year he recorded each story, and the result is a wonderful collection of myths, fables, and fairy tales. If you know Korean culture, you will recognize the uniquely-Korean aspects of many of the stories. If you don't know Korean culture, it may be an unusual but intriguing experience. Instead of princesses, witches, dragons, and the like - here it's filial sons, righteous magistrates, goblins, tigers, rabbits and toads.I enjoyed the book so much, I bought copies for my brother and my mother, so we could all have these stories to read to our children (and grandchildren). I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Social Importance of Self Esteem","review":"I received the book very quickly as I was using it for a paper I was writing in class.

But the story is more complicated than that. He begins to realize that his world is based on visual things through the eyes of his therapist and falls in love with her given her innate honesty. She also begins to see the true beauty within herself through her sessions with him and begins to realize that her past doesn't have to define her. The love story is very sensual in that he is blind and he uses his other senses to woo her and win her heart. It is a great story of two people who heal each other and fall in love in the process."},{"Title":"Sarah And The Stranger (Silhouette Desire)","review":"This is a very romantic book that should be read by any lover of romance. Its a great story of growth through loving, and learning to love oneself and accepting the past and moving beyond it. Wade had to learn to accept the world in a non-visual way, and Sarah had to move beyond her painful past that included a very abusive marriage and uncaring parents. My only complain was that I felt denied the opportunity of Wade learning the truth of Sarah's bad marriage, as they sort of glossed over that part when the spoke of it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a little faith in romance, despite emotional scars.Cyndi"},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"&quot;The Princess of Dhagabad&quot; is a fine book not only by fantasy standards. It deals with many things beyond the seemingly straightforward plot - knowledge and power, duty and desire, destiny and will. Years of writing scientific papers affected the author's style - the language is precise and clear even when facing Unknown. The pace of the book is somewhat more relaxed than is typical for the genre but those extra words per unit of action are worth reading. The book is rather mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life. Generally, fans of Conan the Barbarian saga will be disappointed; fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"I picked up this book for ten cents at a garage sale, and I've been putting off reading it. Not sure why, but I just didn't have the urge to actual read it until today. And I wish I hadn't have waited. This turned out to be a pretty good book.The Princess of Dhagabad has long awaited her twelfth birthday. For it is on this day that she is allowed to have the bottle that her grandmother left to her. And she gets quite the surprise that the bottle holds a Djinn. An all-powerful being that is essentially her slave since she holds the bottle. At first indifferent, he grows to be her closest friend and when she must marry, he is there to make sure that everything can go as smooth as possible. He just doesn't account for the Princess's wishes and sense of adventure, and the belief that she can change things that have never before been changed.The Princess is pretty inquisitive. She has a genuine love of the world around her and it frightens Hasan, her Djinn, that she too could become like him because of the knowledge that she surrounds herself with. He, himself, is somewhat mysterious, but because the history of the Djinn and himself are laid out, it gives an interesting perspective into the life of the Djinn and how he became one. The Princess's parents, and indeed many of the people at the palace, aren't as kind or supportive of her though and at many times it feels like it is the Princess and the Djinn against the world. Which is somewhat unbelievable. I'd like to think there are more redeemable people than just the two of them.The plot meandered along. I had a sense it was more setting up the characters and the relationships before the next book. But that was ok, I thought the history and story telling behind the characters was interesting. The writing was a tad juvenile, but easy to lose yourself in. I liked when the Princess had her world view but found Hasan's point of view to be a little over flowery. It didn't detract too much from the book though. There were some mature themes that I didn't expect in this book. The Sultan and his harem were described in great detail, including some of those activities that they partake in. Not that that's a bad thing, just not what I expected from this young adult seeming fantasy story. There is a little bit of violence, but it is not nearly as descriptive as the sex scenes are.I'll definitely be looking out for the second book in the series. I'm eager to see what happens and if Hasan and the Princess can overcome more obstacles with their friendship.The Princess of DhagabadCopyright 2000272 pagesReview by M.

This is a story of a princess and a genie, but told in such a fresh and original way that I was...mesmerized.Kashina takes the reader for a wonderful ride. While I wasn't on a magic carpet because this is not your typical genie, I had dreams of breaking the mold in a restricted culture. The world-building was magnificent. I found myself wanting this Genie to give me knowledge and develop me into a strong women. She creates an adventure that sucked me in and soon had me wishing I had more time to spend with the princess and more importantly with her djin--Hasan.Kashina is a fine writer with an eye for great detail. It is this detail, though, that gave me my only point for pause. At times, the author goes into too much detail, at least for me. Others might find this preferable, but I would have liked a little less in some parts. With that said, it never stopped me or even slowed me down.The first few chapters were groundwork, to orient the reader, after that I was lured in. Normally I like to space out my reading and do a few pages a night. Princess of Dhagabad had me turning pages too fast. I finished in two nights and then wished I had another just like it to read.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys great writing, strong characters, a magnificent world, and the desire to \\"get away\\" and lose yourself for a couple of nights.

The story often makes abrupt perspective changes (from princess to Hasan and back) without properly setting up for them. Yes, the idea was to slowly let you realize who is speaking in italics, but for the first few chapters, I thought her dead grandmother was talking to us in italics instead of Hasan due to lacking even a guarded hinting towards it. Intended or not, it came off as sloppy at first and heavy-handed later.Also, there were missing words and blatant grammatical errors throughout the work. Though they were not nearly as abundant as what is normally seen in books downloaded on free giveaways, it truly is depressing that someone who can so wonderfully craft such lovable and wonderful characters cannot bother to find an editor with even a college student's grasp of grammar to read over her work. My hope and prayer is that her second book is reviewed by someone with a better grasp of tense, word order, and with an eye for missing words."},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"Original, well written, smart, unpredictable...a great adventure and escape.

Hasan is a slave who cannot be freed.Anna Kashina is a smooth writer making THE PRINCESS OF DHAGABAD a pleasure to read. Her concept of the djin being the gods' way of punishing humans who learn too much is amusing and creates an internally consistent magic system.Not a lot actually happens in this novel. The adventure is personal and coming of age, rather than monumental.

After becoming familiar with the unusual, ceremonious English, I could not stop reading the book to the end.It is the Arabian Nights story of the bottle imp, told in a new and completely original way. The young princess is always accompanied by the djinn Hasan, whom she has liberated from the bottle. The djinn turns out to be very wise, highly intelligent (sometimes he talks like a modern scientist), and sometimes mildly ironic. He leads the princess into a world of oriental splendor and helps her in difficult and dangerous situations.The colorful story is told in a captivating way. Walking on the tight rope of logical paradox, the reader looks down to a paradise. The book is to be read and re-read several times; each time one discovers something new.

The beautiful palace gardens and exotic oriental cities are not merely a background for the story of a young girl turning into a young woman. The young heroine LIVES in this world, and it becomes part of our own as we read the book.I believe that the most important ability of a real writer is the ability to create a new world, where the readers can live alongside the characters of the story.

In addition, the author has original views on the nature of knowlegde and religion that stimulate thought."},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"I got this book a few days ago and I simply couldn't put it down until I read it all the way to the end. I believe that this story has every attribute of real classics, like Tolkien, and Harry Potter books. It may not appeal to the lovers of violent epic sagas, but I cannot imagine anyone reading this book and not enjoying every bit of it. Its vividly described Arabian Nights' setting provides a beautiful frame for the genuine feelings of love, and duty, and frustration that gets resolved in the most magical way! I highly recommend it not only to the readers of fantasy, but to the readers of literature in other genres."},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"Reminiscent of \` Tales From The Arabian Nights', \` The Princess Of Dhagabad' tells the story of the friendship between a princess and a djin. On her twelfth birthday, the princess, whose name we do not learn until the very end of the book because of the tradition of her people, is finally allowed to un-stopper the brass bottle bequeathed to her by her grandmother and discovers she has inherited a very unusual slave. His name is Hasan and he is one of the mysterious djin, a being both feared and prized. He can be anything or do anything, but only at the command of his mistress.Hasan seems a reserved and aloof being, as one might imagine an all-powerful djin to be, but as his story unfolds, it becomes apparent Hasan was very human before he became trapped in a brass bottle. The princess craves knowledge outside of the limited sphere of the palace and the lessons she is required to take in preparation for succeeding her father as ruler of the kingdom. Hasan is happy to expand her horizons and, through his stories and their adventures together, we learn how he came to be a confined in a brass bottle and what it means to be a djin. Hasan is all powerful, but his knowledge has come at a terrible price.One by one, the princess and the djin overcome obstacles to their friendship, which deepens throughout the years. Hasan wins the trust of the princess' mother early by saving the young girl's life. Proving himself valuable to the sultan, the princess' father, is more complicated. The sultan feels slighted by fate because none of his sons have survived birth or infancy. He has only daughters, the princess being the oldest and the only child of his wife. Sensibly, the sultan listens to Hasan's advice and the djin's place in the palace becomes more assured.Though the friendship between the princess and the djin maintains an innocent aspect, it becomes clear their bond is more than simple and when the princess attains her majority and a husband is chosen for her, that bond is tested. The princess will have to make a choice between respecting her father's wishes, what is best for her kingdom and her heart.Anna Kashina has created a full and vibrant world for her story. Her characters are richly drawn. I was excited to read a story set in a different world and enjoyed absorbing new lore as set out by the author. The friendship between the princess and the djin is especially touching and grows at a wonderfully slow and real pace. This is a love story, but it does not read like a romance novel. Rather, it is an adventure story filled with realistic relationships, from friendship to love. I look forward to reading the next novel in the trilogy, to be published in September 2012.(Review written for and originally published at SFCrowsnest.com)"},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"This book is beautiful and fresh. It offers perspectives on life, love, and knowledge that are rarely seen in literature. The setting and characters are vivid, the conflicts are original, and the ending is exquisite. I highly recommend Princess of Dhagabad."},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"This is a wonderful book, with depth, pathos, and above all, love. We are drawn by Kashina into an imagined, entrancing world, where the transforming power of love works its magic on both the princess and her slave."},{"Title":"The Princess of Dhagabad (Spirits of the Ancient Sands)","review":"If you are an adult who loves Harry Potter, you should definitely read this book. It is set in the ancient Middle East instead of modern day England, and it has those sensual parts that are definitely not appropriate for young adults, but this book has the same genuine purity of an all-time classic. It tells of a princess growing up in a richly described world of the Arabian nights. She is a shy and quiet child with a lot of responsibilities, but her life completely turns around on her twelfth birthday when she finds herself in command of an all-powerful djinn who obeys nobody else but her. It is not simply an adventure book, although you will find plenty of magical adventures an near-death experiences there. It explores the meaning of wisdom and suffering that comes with it. Also, the meaning of true love. The book is beautifully written and deeply moving and it will leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"Karmic Palmistry: Explore Past Lives, Soul Mates, & Karma","review":"Karmic Palmistry explores the connection between Karma and hand reading enabling you to better understand your life.

As with Saint-Germain's other book - Runic Palmistry - this new work is well written and an entertaining as well as educational read.

I have since used the information I gathered from this book to tell people the possibility of previous lives, their soul age and their karmic debt (or lack thereof.) They can choose to decide for themselves whether they would like to believe it or not, of course.The only part I found utterly confusing was the reference to the i-ching palmistry toward the end of the book. That will be my next reading once I become more familiar with all the other concepts. If you are familiar with it and would like to know more, it is covered in a large portion of the book.I definitely recommend this to anyone who is also learning on their own, and/or who would like to supplement their palm reading with the addition of these karmic concepts."},{"Title":"Karmic Palmistry: Explore Past Lives, Soul Mates, & Karma","review":"This book provided an interesting and informative discussion of karma, chakras, reflexology and soul mates.

I have read many books on the subject which are close to 50. This book is a real waste of money.

It doesn't even start gettingcool until the last three or four chapters of the book (or more specificly, where the kids break up into two groups). I also have to say, that the characters are kind of flat (with the exception of Piggy, who is probably the best one in the story). I liked the concept behind the story a lot, but not much of its characters. I think that if I was ever asked to recommend a book that told a good story of a group of people &quot;free&quot; from a totalitarian rule (in this case, the rule of grown ups), then I would be more tempted to recommend &quot;Animal Farm&quot; then &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, although I might have to think twice."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am a pre-service teacher required to write up lesson and unit plans by the bucket.

This is not one of those books that you can't put down; moreover, it is one that you can't pick up. The plot is very hard to follow and in the end none of the main points seem to all tie up in some main ending. Maybe the point of the author was to leave you hanging, but I don't know.

The smaller boys (or &quot;littluns&quot; as the big boys say it) keep talking about &quot;the beast&quot;, a gruesome ententity that lurks wherever the boys are not looking.

Two of these boys ralph and piggy discover a conch shell on the beach, and piggy realizes that it could be used to call everyone one in the island together for meetings. Once everyone is together the boys go about selecting a leader and figure out a way to be rescued. The boys choose ralph as their leader and ralph appoints jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt for food for the entire group. As this continues they build a fire to signal for help and they gather wood for building huts and shelters.QUOTES-Ralph \\"This is out island. It is a good island. Untill the grown ups come to fetch us we'll have fun.Piggy \\"How can you expect to be rescued if you dont put first things first and act proper.Golding \\"there was the brillaint world of hunting, tactics, fierce exhileration, skill and there was the world of longing and baffled common-senseMAIN CHARACTER DISCRIPTIONRalph- 12 years old, blonde hair and he is the most charismatic of the group. He is said to be built like \\"one who is to box\\", and is chosen as leader due to his many positive qualities. He has conflict with jack during the whole story, attempting to keep order when jack isnt concerned with it. So ralph and piggy together represent the struggle for order and democracy.JACK- who is skinny, has red hair, and an ugly freckled face. At first he is the leader of his chior group, who became hunters but then his savage personality and ability to tell people what they want to hear allows his to overtake ralph as cheif.PIGGY- who is short,over weight and wears glasses, represents order and democracy. He has asthma and doesnt care to do strenuous work on the island. He is the smartest boy on the island but he lacks social skills, so he usually doesnt fit in. His glassesd are very important, the boys use them over and over to start fires throughout the novel.The Lord of The Flies is set on a deserted tropical island, which is during war time in london in 1963.The genre of this book is fiction.The details in this story were all realistic and for humor everyone made fun of the fat kid \\"piggy\\"The theme is an attempt to take the defects of society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apperantly logical and respectableBasically any high school english teacher would like this bookThis is the only book where a group of boys are on a deserted tropical island that turn to savageryComments the book was dull too much detail \\"not every ones cup of tea\\"Most of the readers read this book in one of their high school english classesConclusion is basically these kids from britain were stuck on a isladn from ages 12 and under some survived but at the end of the novel the boys turned to savagery."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm convinced that the only people who hate this book are the morons who can't understand it. I think to review on this site you should have to pass an intelligence test. I was reading the one star reviews, and I am absolutely amazed at how stupid some people are. Someone claimed that this book was just \\"An english teacher's sick violent fantasies\\" and someone else called it \\"pointless.\\" If you can read this book and derive no meaning from it, you should probably go back to reading comic books. This is one of the most meaningful books ever written. It teaches such an important lesson about human nature, and the fact that so many people can't understand that is scary.Honestly, yes, the book can be a bit boring at times, but it's prupose isn't to entertain. The book is trying to teach a lesson about society and human nature, and it does this very well. The symbolism used in this book is amazing, and it brilliantly shows the message of the book to the people intelligent enough to understand it.

But, leaders do pop up and soon feuds occur, some resulting in death.I reccomend this book to adults or adventurous kids who are dazzled by a book with a good moral(humanity can be hostile) and a splendid bunch of characters that the author introduces very well.I give Lord of the Flies 4 stars for a few reasons. One reason is that the amount and age of the kids was never mentioned in the book- a tad confusing. Secondley, the ending seemed...runshed.

I didn't care for it because I couldn't relate to what was going on."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This story happens very slowly and painfully. It is the most boring story I have ever read in my entire life. Some of the characters who are meant to be important are never really developed such as Simon and Roger. The only thing that makes this book possibly worth reading is the fact that it is very short and that the symbolic meaning is important and interesting. The message of this story is that we could not survive with no rule. We would become savages. I would not reccomend reading this classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book had good morals but it was so confusing, that to even understand one of the main points in the book i needed cliffs notes. some of it was exciting inside the chapter but i cant remember one cliffhanger chapter ending. trust me, if you are a teen, take it from another, unless FORCED to read this for school (like i was) dont read this book. it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book. whoever called it a classic is crazy"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the author William Golding was trying to show there is a beast in everyone.

In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic.

The story is this: a group of English schoolboys get shipwrecked on an island, and eventually go crazy and kill each other. It was just evil. The one boy, Ralph, who is the &quot;main character&quot; of the book, has very few faithful followers. His rival, Jack, has a much larger group of followers - and they think there is a &quot;beast&quot; on the island. To lure it (to try to capture it), they kill a pig and put its head on a stick. This becomes the &quot;Lord&quot; of the flies, because so many flies crawl in and out of its disgusting, dead eyes (or holes where the eyes WERE), nose, and mouth. I couldn't believe this book when I read it, and no one on earth could persuade me to read it again. Ewww."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I believe that the author's purpose in the &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book. I wouldn't have used such large discriptive words But &quot; The Lord of the Flies&quot; was a good book and I would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the authors purpose for writing this book, was to show that people can't survive in peace without rules. I agree with the message because in the story you see results of rules not properly enforced and broken rules. The literary element the author handled the best was symbolism. I agree because he had so much symbolism and it made the most sense to me. This was and wasn't believable. I would have made the story better by not being so cruel to the boys with good intentions. I probably would have killed Jack and Roger instead of Simon and Piggy. In conclusion, I think the book was good, but I would recommend it to mature readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's message is that with out rules, chaos and savagery would occur. I agree with this message because children left unattended have no one to prevent them from doing wrong, no authority. I like the characters and the plot that the author created. It really helps display the author's message of life without rules: everyone would run wild. The book was believable because the children really acted like children would act with out any adults. Although the novel had an excellent begining and middle, the ending was in one word, stupid. I didn't understand it either. The end seemed like he didn't spend much time on writing it and rushed. If he wouldn't have rushed, the ending would have been clearer."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's message in this book was to open the eyes, and reveal how evil can appear in anyone. I agree with his message because it's true: evil can appear where ever it wants to. Just look at those school shootings, they unfortunately prove my point. I think he did the characters very descriptively. He is psychoanalyzing every main character in the entire book. It was very believable. I could imagine a news report saying about a couple of boys found on a burning island. About changing the book, I think it should stay the way it is. Some parts are very confusing, but it should stay the way it is. Some parts are important and confusing, but they need to stay because they are important and changing them could change the entire &quot;lot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; in my eighth grade accelerated literature class.

He also fails to mention if Sam and Eric are identical twins or not. The first 5 or 6 chapters aren't all that great, and I don't really get why he calls it THE LORD OF THE FLIES, all that much. But I do have to say the ending is great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The point of the book was that if all people in the world got along then things should run smoothly. The one main reason that i enjoyed the book so much is because it had great detail that helped things to be understood easier. Also this book was good because it uses a realistic situation which makes things to be understood better from the reader's point of view. After reading this book and then being stranded on an island, the book could be a good source. It could help you out and give you ideas when stranded. There was one part that made the book exciting: this was when the conch was used at the beginning of the book. It had started the group off smoothly and basically ended group stiuations smoothly too. Without the conch, not as much success would have been accomplished. The conch had symbolized teamwork and togetherness. The conch was one of my favorite parts of the book, because it had solved the major problem of being stranded on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think I would rate this book a four star, because the story shows that kids aren't as mature as adults and can't handle themselves. Lord of the Flies is a book of excitement, and cliffhangers. It was interesting in many different ways. The story starts out seeming like a story that these kids are just going to live on an island until freed. Things become a lot more different in that the boys seem to be organized into a group that becomes uncivilized. Also shows that some kids do care and want things to be successful like Piggy. Near the end of the book, violence takes place. This point of the stroy I liked, because in a way it turned the story around in that they had more problems then just disorganization. The way this book just all tied together was so great, and was interesting. There aren't many books out there that have an ending so rough and everything else so exciting, but this one did. So all in all this book was up to par, and would be given a high number to a lot of people.

It has enough action, to keep the reader glued to the book, while it involves a deep plot, that will excite any reader. There are many suspensful parts in the book, my favorite is in the end, where the boys hunt Ralph. It is very interesting, and it relstes in so many ways to societies in the world today; democratic opposed to a dictatorship. This is a classic that everyone must read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Symbolism played an important part in the development of story. This narrative technique is used to give a significance to certain people or objects, which represent some other figure. There are many other aspects in the story that may be considered symbolism, but the several above are probably the most significant. Another good example of symbolism, brought to my attention by a site visitor, is the shape of the island. The boat shape of the island is an ancient symbol of civilization. The water current around the island seems to be &quot;flowing backwards,&quot; giving the subtle impression that civilization may be going backwards for the island or its inhabitants. Additionally, another reader pointed out that Jack could also represent Communism or Fascism. Golding was influenced by events during the time period that the book was written, which was around World War II."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is not as shallow as it appeares. Golding is trying to tell the public that there is an evil inherent in man. He picks children to be the characters in the novel because children do express themselves more freely than adults. The children want there parents to come rescue them from this horrible island in which they are imprisoned upon because the island government has failed and the boys are killing each other. The boys are fighting against each other. But, it is ironic that at the same time the boys are at the island the grown-ups are having their own war.Piggy is the symbol of the civilized. He is the parent figure to the boys. He is the boy who is wise beyond his years. He is the only boy who wears clothing. The other boys hair gets longer, but Piggy's does not. This is so because, the hair represents savagery. As the boys hair get longer, the savage(the evil) inside of them becomes more and more unleashed.The conch represents the government. Ralph's rule was whoever had the conch could speak. However, when the conch was shattered, so was the boys' government.Simon is the God/Jesus figure. He died because of the mistakes of the boys.This book contains a lot of symbolism. The topics covered in this reveiw are the main ones--but there are about 20 more. Thanks to my teachers for making me read this book and pointing out the main points."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\", by William Golding, is the story of a group of young boys who are involved in a plane crash.

One of the boys, Ralph, a born leader, to takes control of the others. They follow him when he tells them how make weapons, and how to catch fish, and other wild animals. They live this way for a short time until, Jack, a rebellious young boy, decides that he is tired of Ralph bossing him around. He creates his own group and some of the boys follow him deeper into the jungle. After they separate, the two different groups begin have conflicts with the other. In the end, the only boy who stays with Ralph is Piggy, the devoted sissy boy. They try to stick to what they know about their proper British school upbringing while the other boys run wild. Both groups have their own ways of surviving, but both all that the boys are trying to do really is survive.The setting of, \\"Lord of the Flies\\", helps to create a world where boys run free and do their own thing to survive without any adults. In the beginning of the book when the boys wake up on the island they realize that they are all alone. They try to make a structured society to live in, being brought up in British schools all their lived, they know what is right and wrong. After a short time some of the boys begin to rebel against their new way of life, and they venture further from the safety of the beach. As time goes by the boys who stay on the beach at the original camp lead more structured lives, while the other boys turn to a more primitive way of life. Having the boys on a deserted island helps to show how their basic human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is a great book which shows the defects of human beings in an exciting and touching way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am from Tampa, Florida. I board at a school in Melborne called Florida Air Academy. My English teacher Mrs. Palmer made me read The Lord Of the Flies and animal farm. Animal Farm was really weird. This Book on the other hand is groosom. They have a little guy with marks on his face getting burned to death. There is also a little kid named Piggy that gets hit in the head with a rock and dies. All the little good kids on the Island die except for Ralph. Ralph was the leader of the kids then jack took over. This book is good for people that like reading about 6 - 12 year old kids killing each other. This book is a symbol of the modern world. When Golding wrote this book he might have been thinking about the future. With these two,seventeen year old kids killing those people in that school. They in a way became like these kids on the island"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As Truman Capote once pointed out, Golding simply lifted the whole idea for this book out of \\"A High Wind in Jamaica\\" (aka \\"The Innocent Voyage\\") by Richard Hughes. Read the original -- it is much better."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book has a good theme about the break down of socializedbehavior but it gets really boring. The entire plot can be explannedin a pharagraph."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is for the reader who thinks that no child would cause such destruction. You can't be serious. Why then, may I ask you, do we continue to read about children shooting up their schools? Take off your blinders and see that bad things do happen in this world, and sometimes these things are committed by children. Wake up."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Reading the novel, &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; was a great experience for me. This novel gave me a chance to experience the troubles of adulthood and the many difficulties one goes through as they grow older and more responsible. This novel truly points out the risks that people take to survive in a place they are unfamiliar to, and I believe that this is a great example of the trials and tribulations that we go through and the decisions we make in life; whether they are the wrong ones or the right ones. I deffinitely recommend this book to other readers, and hope that each of you can learn something from this novel...the way I did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord Of the Flies by William Golding details the struggles of seven adolescent boys who are stranded on an uncharted island somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. The boys get stranded after their airplane crashed as a result of war-time efforts to bring down European planes during World War II .The struggle for the boy's survival on the island is bound by their friendship and their willingness to work together so that they may make their stay on the island as pleasant as possible. They work together to build shelter and find food. Unfortunately not all of the boys feel that they should cooperate. As soon as the rules were set, a group of rebels took it upon themselves to be outcasts of the group and start up their own clan, which was named the hunters.Although some points of the story are set moderately slow, the storyline is still very good. Most of the adolescents are longing to get off of the island, although some of them like it there. The names of the seven adolescent boys are Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Simon, Sam, Eric, and Roger. Ralph is a twelve year old with blonde hair. Ralph is probably the most charismatic in the group. Another character is Jack who is about Ralph's age, but he has a much skinnier build. Jack is a power-hungry, savage-like, irresponsible child. The next character in the novel is Piggy. He's short and has a high intelligence compared to the other boys. Simon is an intelligent and sensible, and he hopes that he will be rescued off of the island sooner than the other boys. After Simon, there's Roger, a small boy with dirty, shaggy hair. Roger represnts pure evil, even more so even than Jack. Finally, Sam and Eric are two young twins who always travel and do everything together. Without each other, they are incapable of doing very much at all.Although times were hard, the boys pulled through and were rescued off of the island. They were picked up by a Navy cruiser, and brought out to sea with the ship. I feel that the end of the novel shows war on different scales. On the island the boys were battling with the hunters and the beast. On the cruise ship, the boys will see firsthand fighting between soldiers on the Navy cruiser against battling countries during World War ll. I felt that this novel had an excellent story-line with plenty of fun, excitement, and would be an enjoyable reading experience for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think Lord of the Flies has to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life (and i've read quite a few!) What's interesting to note about most of these reviews is that most of the one or two star ratings and negative comments are probably given by high school students who were made to read it. Well, I read this book in high school and also disliked it immensely. However, now that I've matured a bit (or so i like to think!) and re-read it, I simply cannot understand how anyone cannot be moved by this book! It's insights are extremely profound. But I could see why someone who is in high school and is being made to read this book would not enjoy it. All I have to say is give it another chance when you're older guys! It's worth it. :-)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was not a fan of this book because i couldn't get into the story line. I read it simply for school, not pleasure"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all.In my opinion, this book tends to be a bit wordy and boring. The dialogue can be hard to follow at times, especially if you are unfamiliar with English slang of that time period. I had to force myself to read it, and the only reason I did so was because it's a classic. Although I get the point and I understand why the book has appeal, the writing didn't speak to me at all. Even if the story itself is good, and even though there is an underlying meaning that is worth conveying, to me, it's not worth dredging through the muck that is the writing in order to understand it.It's really quite unfortunate."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book, the Lord of the Flies was a decent book to me, but not one of my favorites. I loved the story line but the book was slow often times and I had to make myself keep reading until something interesting happened again.

However, it is not based on either of the movies, the music has been soley adapted and composed based on the original novel. So call it, if you will, a novel score. It sticks to much more of the primal and savage feelings that the book displays. It also dives much deeper into the emotions and behaviors or the characters than any film ever could. If anyone is interested in hearing some of the music or purchasing a copy of the CD please email me at SAVA1224@rock.comThank you"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies offers a mostly offscreen representation of a fallible god, Christian, but with Greek god human frailty, powerful, but not fully divine, not a creator god, but a god who gives birth to creatures much like him, so that the boys on their Eden island can be expected to do no worse nor no better than the adults they want to believe in. A wonderfully crafted, resonant work, not of hope or warning, but simple and dark statement of the way things are, have been, and will be, an exploration of the nature of the world and those that inhabit it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The story starts out showing how children are left to fend for themselves and try to make adult decisions. A fire is started and kills one of the children, showing how no matter what the circumstance a child is left to act like it only knows how to. The counch shell is also introduced and will be a &quot;telephone&quot; for the children and also a sign of power later in the novel. I wasn't to impressed with the slow developments of the first 2 chapters, there was alot of focus put on the children and not enough time spent describing the setting. The characters were highly detailed. Piggy is introduced almost as the adult figure, while there is Ralph who is more the neutral party, and Jack who is the complete opposite of Piggy. They introduce Simon to be like the conscience figure of the group stating how the only beast on the island was the boys themselves. It seems as though Golding attempts to show us almost a battle of good vs evil though out the book until the final chapter as we see the counch being destroyed and Piggy the only one with intelligence being killed. Ralph dodges numerous attacks through out the end chapters to be saved by a navy officer who comes to the island after seeing the smoke. I would have liked to see something happen at the end to the boys who were part of Jacks tribe, or at least see something happen to Jack. The story ends with alot of answered questions in my mind on what happens to the boys, having something to show us what later because of the boys would have been very nice. The story was fairly easy reading with some exception to the early chapters. There was a definate lack of interesting material. The later chapter from the point of the beating death of Simon to the last chapter was much more action packed and really does a good job of filling your imagination. I would have given it a higher rating but the slow begin is why I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies in my opinion is a very interesting book to read. It is about a group of kids that get stranded on a deserted island. It shows how they survive and get along with each other. I would recomend this book to people that like to read old english and like drama and tension between people. It is a book more for people that can read and understand old english. Other wise it is a pretty good book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies begins with an airplane crash. The plane was carrying boys from a British school. The boys find themselves on a deserted island without any adults. A boy by the name Ralph is chosen as the chief, and Jack gets jealous. Jack leads the boys that were a choir and they are elected as the hunters. The small children are given the name \\"littluns,\\" and don't usually do any work at all. Sam and Eric, the twins, work at the top of the mountain to keep a fire going in case of a boat or plane passing by. Piggy, an outcast of the group, is useful in only the fact that he has glasses that are used to light the fire. Rumors of a beast on the island spread. One night, a pilot parachutes onto the island and dies on impact. Sam and Eric assume that it is the Beast, and frighten the boys with their story. Jack, who is starving for power at this point, decides to lead the boys to another part of the island to begin a tribe. Ralph and Piggy remain in the shelters. Jack's hunters go from boys to animals- smearing paint on their faces and hunting. Jack and the hunters tie up a boy, Wilfred, for no apparent reason. Simon, a boy of good sense, realizes that the Beast is only a dead pilot and frantically runs to tell Jack and the others. They think that the Beast has posessed Simon and kill him. Piggy and Ralph take part in this, but they cannot figure out why they did so. Eventually another boy is killed and a couple are captured. Ralph tries to hide from Jack and the hunters. Finally, a naval ship comes to rescue the boys, but Ralph cries as they leave the island because he knows that the boys have lost their innocence.This book displays a good sense of what society can be today. Although people may seem civilized, we are to some extent barbaric in the ways we live. Many are hungry for power and money when, really, these are not essential to life in any form. The search for an idol in the story was mostly to give the boys something to do. It is unfortunate that even today, as innocent as it may seem, people have created idols. They are being deceived. If people could realize that survival on Earth is only possible through accepting Christ and having a relationship with God, then they would not be so deceived. This book was a good lesson in how our lives can turn messy if we don't follow instructions and rules set before us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has a great plot, a group of shipwrecked boys gone wild, killing multiple people. I liked the book except for one major part, the book was Extremely descriptive. Whole pages would be devoted to describing the island scenery before anything actually happened."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of English schoolboys, while being evacuated from England during World War II, fall out of a crashing airplane. They land on a tropical island devoid of adults and start their own society. So begins Lord of the Flies, by William Golding.There are three main characters in this book: Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. Ralph is strong and sensible. He is confident that they will be rescued and meanwhile works to make the island a better place. Piggy is obese and a social outcast. However, he is very wise and tries to advise Ralph, because Ralph is his only friend. Ralph&#65533;s archenemy, Jack, is bossy. He grows a love for hunting and violence.Right after the crash landing on the island, Ralph finds a conch shell and blows on it, gathering all the boys on the island. He decides there should be an election to determine a chief of the island. Ralph represents democracy. He gets elected chief, and does his best to make sure that everyone is equal. Ralph starts a fire on a mountain with Piggy&#65533;s eyeglasses, hoping that passing ships will see a smoke signal. Shelters are built on the shore and food is plentiful. The boys are enchanted by the idea of their own world that they control.But inevitably, disturbing events start to occur. A boy sees a &#65533;snake thing&#65533; in the woods and other see monsters. This gets everyone frightened. Soon a mission is started to find and kill the &#65533;beast.&#65533;Later, after Jack kills a pig, he develops a love for hunting. With an army of boys he starts hunting for pigs. They invent a game in which they form a circle. Another boy comes into the middle of the circle, and the boys on the outside beat him, chanting, &#65533;Kill the pig! Cut her throat! Spill her blood!&#65533; Several boys are injured as a result of this violent ritual.Jack also becomes very rebellious against Ralph and his leadership. For one, Jack is apathetic about the fire on the mountain. He doesn&#65533;t see that the fire is the only way to be rescued. Jack represents totalitarianism and dictator ship.Despite being very creative and original, the book has some weaknesses. For one, it paints a very pessimistic view of mankind. It implies that kids are not inherently innocent, but instead evil when deprived of law and order. Lord of the Flies can also get boring at times. Hunting for pigs, keeping the fire going, finding the beast: these themes reappear so many times it feels repetitive. Too much description also causes the book to be monotonous at times. However, the thrilling climax more than makes up for these minor weaknesses.Golding&#65533;s writing style is usually both interesting and engaging. It offers insight into what would happen to &#65533;innocent&#65533; children when in a world of their own, without parents and authority. In the end, everything turns out fine, but only after an exciting chase and battle. On the surface, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story about boys trapped on a tropical island. But if you look deeper, it is a parable about the true nature of people."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is written about kids marooned in an island and how they survive.This book is very thrilling and interesting the readers what is going to happen next. The story's beginning is that English kids are cast away in the coral island because of the plane crash. They choose Ralph as a chief and start building own community to survive and to be rescued. They explore the island and hunt a pig for food and make a fire as a SOS signal. The community is working at first. But little by little the community is being broken up. Finally some kids pick Jack as a leader and form the other community. When I read this book, I felt how difficult to keep people together. It's not easy to satisfy all people in a community, even people can communicate each other. There is always a conflict we cannot solve by talking between people. And the other thing I found is that happy thing doesn't always happen in a life. Some scenes, like Piggy's death, might be disgusting. But the life is usually full of disasters. We have to accept those things. I learned we should not live in a dream world. A bad thing can happen anytime. And it is important whether we can overcome it. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord Of the Flies is a good book, but graphic.

Without being too cynical or anything, this book has just one major problem in my humble opinion: for those of us who could really give a hoot about botany, this guy writes far too much junk about what the trees and bushes and such look like. All throughout the book I found myself saying, &quot;Okay, they're on a deserted island with lots of trees, bushes! I get it already! Shut up about the damn trees!&quot; Seriously, it reads like this guy originally wrote a fifty page novel, and his editor or someone told him that it needed to be longer."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Fantastic book, of a group of boys stranded on a pacific island.

I thought it was boring, and kinda meaningless. Then school started and we had to read it for class. This time I really enjoyed the book. I actually understooded, I knew where the author was coming from. For those people who hate this book, I don't think you really understood its symbolism, and its real meaning. Then again, I could be wrong. BTW, the auther named the book &quot;Lord of the flies&quot; not entirly because of the pig 's head on a stick, it roughly translate as &quot;Devil&quot; in hebrew"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that this was a very good book for everybody from average everyday readers to collage professors. The average day reader would read this book and see the action and the drama. They would see the fights emerging between Jack and Ralph and they would have fun reading about the pig hunts. Then when they where done they would put it down and go on with their life. They would not however see the more intricate ideas of this book such as theme and symbolism. That is why this is such a good book, it draws in people from all diffrent walks of life. I am just a Sophmore reader from North Gwinnett High School. When I read this book for the first time I just saw the plain old black and white script but then when I started to research it more I saw so much more then that. I understood what Mr. Golding was trying to say. So whether you want to read this book or research it I gurantee that you will like it. Remember this as you go on with your life no matter how high your standards are don't lower them for anybody."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i feel that this book lets everyone who takes the time to read it and actually listen to what the author is trying to say, take a glimpse of what our whole world is really like...i mean we all have heard the stories like cinderella and like gilligans island and how everything works out hunky-dory...well guess what people! that isnt how real life works...people,by nature, are savages...if the situation calls for it...we do and will turn to our most primordial instincts...which is to do anything to survive and destroy all opposition. this book gives any and everybody a close up view of how easily our whole world can come crashing down upon our heads...mayhaps many of us should take heed from what this book tells us...dont lose your heads..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book for school and at first wasnt to crazy about it.

Yes, it's disgusting, parts of it make you want to close the book, almost too afraid to see what's going to happen, but to stop would be to lose track of all that humanity is. My teacher was funny. She said that the first time she read it she was disgusted, but now she teaches that it is one of the greatest books in all literature. It all depends on how you read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was an action book filled with adventure. I think that the author of this book had in mind what he was doing. The most action packed parts were when two of the main characters were killed. The rivalry that goes on in this story is somewhat serious when you have yong boys being cannibals. The things I didn't like was the length and some of the wording. The outcome really was a knowing situation. You knew that most likely they were going to be saved. The things I liked were when he had the characters express their feelings in a unusal and weird way. If you read this book you will be hot and cold. Hot being the action packed areas and cold being the not so action filled areas. I think that you should give this story a shot. I still warn you don't be disapointed by the length.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked this book because it was very suspenseful. The detail of the book was great, you could see what was happning as you read. My favorite part was when they were chanting the pig-killing song. I would recommend this book to an experienced reader."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was written with one purpose in mind: to detirmine whether man is inherently good or evil. Golding began this work with this question in mind, and arrived at the conclusion that man is indeed inherently evil. In between, however, he illustrated how evil outlasts good, how innocence is so easily destroyed, and how the struggle for power can corrupt even the most innocent- children. This is a powerful work that speaks of the stupidity of humans, and how little the struggle for power really means (illustrated at the very end of the book). If you are a reader who enjoys symbolism and hidden meanings, this book is for you. Every part of this book symbolizes something, from the characters and setting to the Lord of the Flies. Well written and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a good book. It was interesting.

You feel it or you don't, not saying that those who don't feel it are not intelligent. I read reviews and saw people complain about the beginning being boring. I think Golding meant it to be this way, so you begin to think yeah so there's a group of boys stuck on an island, so what? But Golding then draws you in, and dipics the change from civilization back to savageness. This book has so many meanings that many people overlook. The first time I read this I was terrified, because I asked myself what is stoping this from happening right now. I have heard critics say that they think this may even be Goldings preminition of apocalypse. So hey if you are interested in human nature give this book a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It's true...the book in its entirety is extremely tedious and slow. The author spends a great deal of time describing the setting of the island, and other nuisances.

Golding's argument is that the durability of evil in human society is directly attributable to the evil within human character. This echoes the idea of original sin in the Bible. Golding novel is also a masterpiece of suspence and horror. I first read it when I was fourteen, and I just re-read it, twenty years later. The novel's impact still resonates powerfully.

These two boys names are Ralph and Jack. They have an election and Ralph wins and is elected chief. He appoints Jack to the hunters ( him and his choir). These two argue about everything whether to gather food, make shelter, or hunt pigs. The one who is always on Ralph's side is Piggy and the one who is always on Jack's side is Roger. The one who is in the middle is Simon he is the one who is on neither side. Another thing is they are always worried about some beastie and the only two who knows there is no beastie is Simon and Piggy. About midway through the book Jack decides he is not going to play anymore and takes him and his savages off to start a new government. This new government ends up killing a pig and having a feast they invite all the good people (Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric) to join them. They end going and they have a little savage dance after they eat. Simon isn't there because he has just found out that the man in the parachute who they think is the beastie is actually just a dead man. When Simon comes down the mountain trying to show them there is no beastie they turn on him and think he is the beast because they are so wrapped up in this savage dance. They end up killing Simon but now most of them are not worried about the beastie because they think that they killed the beastie. Later on the savages raid the other camp for Piggy's glasses so they can have a fire. Ralph's tribe goes to the other tribe to try and get the glasses back and Roger kills Piggy with a huge boulder. After Piggy is killed the savages catch Sam, Eric, and Ralph and tie them up and torture them Sam and Eric give up and join the savages while Ralph escapes. Jack wants Ralph so bad that they decide to go form eats to west all the way across the island they start to walk and Roger finds him Ralph kills Roger and starts running then he hides again and is almost no found until he screams then he takes off running he runs into and officer and the officer thinks they are playing a game then they get rescued and that is where the book ends. So in conclusion this book is a great book and I think it you should read it it's not only about a loss of innocence but also about religious allegory and capacity for Good .vs. Evil.By: Willie Wilson"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\\" Who would have thought when they read this that it was little twelve year old boys screaming this about a friend of theirs? Twelve year old boy savages hunting the only reason left on a deserted island where there is no adult help for the poor, helpless hunted. The only question that needs to be answered is whether it was in their nature to be evil, or were they raised in a bad environment and society made them that way? This question is answered in the classic tale Lord of the Flies by William Golding.William Golding joined the Royal Navy when World War II broke out. For five years he was involved in naval matters finishing his naval career as a lieutenant in command of a rocket ship. He had seen action against battleships, submarines and aircraft, and had participated in the Walcheren and D-Day operations. Today he is famous for his novel Lord of the Flies and its many references to human nature.During World War II in an attempt to get away from the war a group of English schoolboys are plane wrecked on a deserted island only to find that there is no escape of war. They don't mean for this to happen, they first try to cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain fire signals to be rescued. They even elect a leader, Ralph, to oversee everything, who has an intelligent sidekick to help guide him to do the right things. But like all societies, this one has its rebels who would rather swim, play, and hunt the island's wild pigs. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored and challenged by his rival, Jack. Jack starts his own tribe of wild painted savages and as more boys join his band, any civilization deteriorates until some boys are even being hunted.\\"Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing. The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing.\\" Not only is the language extremely descriptive, but this passage, found in the first chapter of the book, already foreshadows the beast on the island. The group of boys end up being Jack and his choir group, which from the beginning is portrayed as a creature, or beast for that is what they become.Golding's book is continuously foreshadowing what will happen, and it is only when you look closely that you see exactly how inevitable it was that Jack and his choir would be the \\"evil\\" tribe. \\"Roger led the way straight through the castles, kicking them over, burying the flowers, scattering the chosen stones. Maurice followed, laughing, and added to the destruction... Only Percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and Maurice hurried away.\\" Maurice and Roger, part of Jack's group, are already testing their limits on how far they can go without getting in trouble. There are no adults on the island, no one to stop them from harming each other and they slowly start realizing that, and get worse and worse in their treatment of each other so they don't even feel guilty for anything they have done.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is the characters. You know them, they may even have characteristics that you recognize as your own. Ralph, marked out from the beginning by his \\"size, and attractive appearance\\" is most likely one of those kids in school who get everything they want because of their looks. A born leader who isn't necessarily the smartest, but strives to do the right thing, but doesn't always know what that is. He has to constantly be reminded of his confidante, Piggy. Piggy is constantly picked on, and called \\"Fatty\\" or \\"Piggy.\\" We don't even know his real name, but he is known by the sad, pathetic nickname he told everyone in the beginning. Never taken seriously, he would be known as the sad outsider who didn't have many friends, intelligent, and a bookworm. If he was listened to, maybe they would have fared better, but we will never know since everyone is judged on appearance in this book. Finally, there is Jack, a true bully, commanding and teasing so everyone knows who the true leader is.Because we can relate, we can even understand why certain things happen because we are familiar with the teasing, and bullying that takes place. It helps us understand what happens to these boys, and become even more aware that it is happening right now. It is happening in school, the workplace, against other races, Iraq, and this book is to show us just how bad it is. Human nature, are we naturally evil, or is it society that makes us the way we are. According to Lord of the Flies it is the way we are born, but it is up to you to decide."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very interesting novel. It is thrilling and full of suspense. The novel is about some boys stranded in an island and becoming savages. When I finished the novel I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept on thinking of how some of the boys survived. They had what they needed to survive, a signal, hunters for food, and shelters. They had no adults around to take care of them. Some of them were trying really hard to get allong and follow the rules that they had made for themselfs. But in a story there is always someone who doesn't like to go with the rules. Later on the boys become savages and fight against each other. This novel made me understand how important it is to have an adult around and what their knowledge can bring. I really enjoyed this novel and I know that anyone can enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"as most i read this book as a teenager for a literature class. it was originally written to reflect the horrors of war and to explain how man could fall to such depth's of inhumanity. reading it now and looking at it from today's perspective of terrorism and the slaughter of innocents, it takes on deeper meaning.is man an inherently evil being? is its thin veneer of organized society barely restraining our natural instincts? the study of these children going from a semblance of society to murder is chilling.these are the questions this book asks. the same questions that we face today? is nature getting the better of us(terrorism) or can we keep our instincts under control.in the book jack and the hunters win. what does our future hold?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I give this book 4 star because it was great.

In the beginning they start out well-mannered and civilized under the leadership of the protagonist, Ralph. They build shelters, gather food, and keep watch over signal fires in hope of rescue. All this structure seems to fall apart when the antagonist, a red-headed \\"hunter\\" named Jack decides he is through with Ralph and his ways and wants to start his own tribe of hoodlums and savages. They leave all of their morals behind and succumb to human nature and the want of acceptance and power."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This isn't the only William Golding novel I've read, but it is by far the best. He uses outstanding dialect and language to portray the plight of a group of boys stranded on an island. However, the symbolic nature of this book transcends nearly everything else I've ever written. I orinally read this as a twelve year old not realizing what I was getting into. I recently re-read it as a twenty-eight year old, and its relevance to world events even today is astounding.This is a loose transition from Orwell's Animal farm, where the good guys become the bad guys in the end. It seems ironic how, at first, the boys cooperate because of their need and desire for structure and discipline. However, as the story unwinds, we find some of the boys wanting freedom. It is a freedom for which they have to fight, too. However, in the undertaking of that freedom, they end up becoming the oppressors.This is a brilliant story with few, if any, flaws. It is the history of the world in a nutshell. All we need to know about history is in this short book. It's too bad so very few understand it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's very first novel, Lord of the Flies, is an intriguing look at aspects of human nature as it explores the thin line between human reason and animal instinct. In Lord of the Flies, Golding tries to accurately portray human nature or at least as he saw it. The underlying theme of this novel is the idea of good vs. evil or order vs. chaos. The most notable struggle in the novel is between man and himself as the children fight with their instinct to live by rules against their instinct to act violently. The story begins when a group of English school boys become plane wrecked on a deserted island. In the beginning the group of stranded boys acts as one and cooperate well with eachother. They attempt to gather food, make shelters and signal fires, and anything else they can do just to survive. The novel's protagonist, Ralph, represents order and leadership. He steps forward as the leader and oversees their efforts to survive as well as maintain some amount of order and decency among the group. His sidekick, Piggy, is a chubby boy with glasses. His glasses represent the power of science and intellect. He also tries to help Ralph maintain order throughout the story. At first they manage establish some rules and some sense of order on the island. However, too many of the kids want to goof off and hunt animals rather than focus on survival or rescue. Ralph's leadership gets ignored and the desire of the boys to fool around and live in chaos leads to the splitting of the boys into two camps. Jack, the antagonist, represents savagery and the desire for power. He manages to lure most of the boys away to join his camp of savages. Ralph's camp represents good and Jack's camp represents evil. Ralph's camp focuses on the rescue effort while Jack's camp decides to hunt, feast, and lie around. The situation gets progressively worse as the values and morals of everyday civilization are lost. What happens next makes this classic novel a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's very first novel, Lord of the Flies, is an intriguing look at aspects of human nature.

Lord of the Flies is an interesting novel that explores the thin line between human reason and animal instinct. It is a wonderful book and I would recommend it to any reader at the high school level."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The lord of the flies is a book with a mixture violence, friendship, and magical realism. The friendship between Ralph and piggy isn't just any ordinary friendship but more like one between a teen and a pet he has owned since he was a small boy.The rivalry between Ralph and jack on the other hand is like that of two rampaging behemoths who despise each other.I like this book because of the small amount of magical realism that was added to this book because i dont't like realism. I don't like this book because of the descriptive senseless violence in it and also because I think that of kids that ages were stuck on an island the last thing they would think about would be hunting and killing. I think that other people might enjoy this book when they read it becuause of the violence and action."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord Of The Flies by William Golding is a good book about a group of British school boys who are left isolated on and island, and eventually begin to lose their sanity. The island seems realistic but I think it lacks detail because I didn't feel like I was there. The book describes how the boys slowly drive themselves crazy from the idea of a \\"beast\\" being on the island.The book starts with the group of children choosing a leader among themselves and deciding on a bunch of laws to follow. I think that William Golding did a good job describing Ralph. I felt like I connected to him and I could understand why he did what he did. When Jack, is not chosen leader, he begins to follow his own rules and attracts many fellow boys to do also. As the story develops, Jack and his band form a completely separate \\"tribe\\". This is one of the reasons that I don't like Jack throughout the story.Through the story, innocent young children become crazy and un-controllable. William Golding teaches the lesson that even young people, however innocent in the beginning, can become insane as a result of a lack of authority and civilized people to guide them. I would recommend this book to people who like adventure stories or survivor stories."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is about boys ages 8-16 that are in an airplane crash and become stranded on an island. They have to work together to survive, but instead, they fight. The theme of this book is to get along with others. William Golding shows the chaos of what can happen when you bicker or argue with other people.My favorite character in Lord of the Flies is Piggy. Piggy has really good ideas, but no one listens to him because he is fat. I could really relate to him because sometimes I have good ideas, but people shut me out. I also like him because he resembles someone from outside of the island who is not crazy.I enjoyed the author's writing style. He stresses details that are important to understanding the story. He also uses a lot of symbolism. You really have to search for it, but it's fun. For example, the fire represents rescue. The conch, also a big part of this story, symbolizes sanity and peace.While the ending of this book wasn't the greatest, I did like it. If you enjoy symbolism and a good story- read Lord of the Flies. I'm sure you'll love it too!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"An all time great novel. Whether you are studying \\"the nature of man\\" or just looking for a fun read, this one is for you. Has it all . . . stay up late suspense, deep implications about humanity, and a breathtaking ending. A quick read. Don't miss it. Lead me to try out Goldings \\"The Spire\\". Another great classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a great survival, adventure novel for those looking for that type of a book. At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book or not. I was just going by what some of my classmates had said about it. It turns out they were right, and I loved this book. Golding was able to grab my attention right from the beginning of the novel and keep me interested all the way to the end.The first few characters that the author introduces you to are Ralph and Piggy. These two form a strong friendship after finding each other on the island. Their plane crashed on an island, and a group of young boys are the only survivors. Now, Ralph, Piggy, and Jack become the leaders of the other boys in order to survive. These normal boys turn into savages after they feel like they must fight for their food and lives. It is a great struggle for these boys all the way to the end.The authors use of imagery really made me feel like I was one of the boys lost on the island. I could picture everything that was happening to them. It is extremely scary to think that this could happen, and you feel much saddness for these boys stranded on the island.For those who love books with lots of adventure, Lord of the Flies is the book for you. You want to see these boys be rescued from their nightmare and that is what keeps you reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the novel \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" William Golding does a magnificent job of abandoning the reader on the island with the stranded boys as they struggle to survive, maintain order, and above all be rescued. At times, I felt so desperate to be saved and so utterly terrified by the thought of the impending disorder and absence of authority, that death seemed a better fate than continuing to exist in that place. The book often made me feel helpless and scared; I can only imagine the loneliness and despair Ralph endured. I wanted more than anything for him to be able to click his heels three times and get back to his safe world of horses and clean sheets.While the events surrounding the crash onto the island are unclear, one thing is for certain, this situation is the perfect set-up for a display of the true nature of man. The differences between Ralph and Jack are obvious, and those differences represent the various battling forces in today's society. Personally, I find the topic rather disturbing. The way the boys slowly transformed into savages--forgetting things like compassion, honesty, and trust, in their relentless hunt and lust for meat, deeply bothered me.I cannot say that I loved every second of this novel, mainly due to its subject matter, but Golding's imagery is fantastic and his characterization is wonderful. I don't believe that a better book could be written about this kind of topic. If only it had been about puppies and sunshine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was a mystery to me as to what it was going to be about. I had to read the book in the 10th grade for school. But, as I started reading it, I loved it. This book is a great fictional survival book. The way the boys worked together at the beginning of the book was great, they were thrown into a world in which they had to survive on their own, and they did. They worked together amazingly and I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was very good. It gave me a new outlook on mankind and human nature. It shows how everyone has the ability to become hostile and savage like. Everything in the book represents something. I wish Golding would have written more about Ralph and the others AFTER they were rescued. It would be interesting to see if they learned anything! I think this is a good book; I recommend everyone to read it in order to know what man is really like."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was very different from any other book I have ever read. Before reading this book, I did not understand what an allegory was exactly. After realizing that it meant a story with two or more levels of meaning, I realized this book demonstrated that exactly. It is obvious that this book has remained a classic throughout the years, since it was published in 1959 and is still used throughout classrooms today. There was really nothing I disliked about this book. Lord of the Flies demonstrates a smaller world fueled by savagery, and controlled by democracy and human nature. It describes how humans can act as barbaric as animals when put into certain situations. It shows the relation between humans and animals and how similar they are. Reading a book like this one can only enlighten your perspective on the world around you, which gives you no reason to avoid reading it. This book stands for so much more than what it seems. When broken down into smaller pieces, you can really see Goldings focus on making the reader question the book, and see how closely it relates to modern civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The lord of the flies is a very good book. I like the meaning of the book more than the story. It really makes you think. Everything you read has another meaning to it. For example the island they are on shows what is happening in the world. As they fall apart the world is too (the world is at nuclear war). The island is like a small version of the world or a \\"Microcosm\\". This book is not too long but is very difficult to understand. I found myself needing to read the chapters multiple times to understand them, but it is worth it. I recommend that everyone reads this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The noval \\"Lord of the flies\\" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book . Not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message.But through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is extremely easy to read, mostly fast paced, and very insightful. Golding has many points that he makes in this novel. To name just a few:1. The form of government does not matter so much as the character of the individuals being governed. The best government in the world will fail if those being governed have poor character. A democraticly ruled island of criminals will likely be worse off than a country of well-to-do people ruled by a dictator. Ralph's government fails, not because it is necessarily a bad form of government, but because of the character of the boys on the island, who easily fall prey to the ideal of Jack. Golding is saying that the problems in our society are not due to the form of government that we have, but to the moral character of the citizens of our country.2. The decay of belief in rationality. Piggy represents rational thinking. His glasses are broken part way through the book, and he can no longer see clearly. In the end, the school-boys turned savages kill Piggy, signifying the death of rationality. Goulding was mourning the slow decay of rational thinking in the West, and it can easily be seen that it has now decayed beyond what Goulding was appaled at, as postmodernism has openly rejected rationality.3. The Freudian concept of ego, superego, and id. Other reviewers have already explained this, so I will not simply repeat what they have said.In conclusion, this is a classic for a reason: it is well written, and expresses the philosophy that Goulding pulled out of the 1950's. It is a very well written tragedy, and deserves to be read.Overall grade: A."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Given the current state of the world, and especially current events as of this writing, it's hard to say that LORD OF THE FLIES is shocking. But it is, in its own way, and hopefully will remain so. In this Golding novel, society is held up for us to look at, through the actions of a few stranded boys on an island. Metaphors abound, and for good reason: Golding is trying to teach us something by putting our own society's evils on display via a group of gone-wild adolescents. And it works. The unfortunate thing is that we, as a society, seemed to not have learned the lesson Golding was trying to teach. This is a classic, stellar book with a superb message--if only we would listen. Would also recommend two other books as we read them in lit class: CANNERY ROW by Steinbeck, BARK OF THE DOGWOOOD (I think this one's getting banned), and OF MICE AND MEN."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding is about a group of boys trapped on an island in the middle of nowhere because their plane crashed. Lord of the Flies described how the kids dealt with life on the island with no adults and no sign of rescue in sight.Lord of the Flies is an interesting book. It has great interaction among the characters, especially between Ralph and Jack. Ralph is an athletic kid. He believes in order and building a civilization on the island. That is why Jack and he fight. Jack is a strong-willed kid. He believes that the best way to run the island is just go hunt, and turn in the rest of the castaways into savages. Ralph was the original leader of the tribe Jack, however, did not like how Ralph was leading, and he started his own tribe. The two tribes did not get along and that made the story interesting.I enjoyed the way the boys learned to survive on the island by hunting and getting their own food. Jack's tribe hunting the boar down was quite exciting. However, I did not enjoy the ending of the book. The story ended too abruptly and almost ruined the book for me. The book also would have been better if it had told more about the happenings. All in all, Lord of the Flies was good book, but because of the ending was disappointing. That is why I rate it 3 out of 5."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the flies takes you on a realistic journy. The story starts when a plane full of british school boys chrases on a deserted island. The boys compete for control of the tribe. With out any parents they stuggle inbetween whats right and whats wrong.This is a personal favorite. It challenges you to think about how the boys feel. It makes you wonder what could happend next. I highly recomend this book. Due to the violance I recomend this book to the older kids."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the early part of the 20th Century a Englishman called Barry wrote a book called The Coral Island. It involved some children who were cast away in the pacific. Full of British pluck they quickly get organized and build a working civilization on the Island. They are more than equal, the adult natives they meet and have far higher and superior values. They have many adventures and all end in triumph. The book was a hymn to Imperialism and the racist assumptions on which it was based. Pacific Islanders probably still ritually burn it as part of their independence ceremonies.William Golding's book has generally thought to be a response. Golding is apparently a deeply religious man and a number of his later books have religious themes. His theme is probably related his view of the nature of man. Unlike Barry he has a pessimistic view of the nature of man and his tendency for evil. He also starts by having a number of school children marooned on an island. The children are all male and appear to be from wealthy backgrounds. Initially there are attempts to collect food and carry on in a civilized way but things break down. A number of the boys chase pigs and set up a pig's head as a sort of religious shrine in a clearing. Towards the end of the book the group turn violent.Golding's book has been prescribed on school texts for years. Unlike most books set for children to read most of them seem to like it. The imagery is startling and the book is quite short. Golding's other works never quite had the same impact as this one.In retrospect although a readable book it is hard to think that it is really about much at all. The subject of the work is after all just children. It is not surprising that poorly socialized kids placed in a difficult social environment might be at sea. The books main message is probably a historic one putting in context the reality of what people are like and should be read in comparison to Barry's work which suggested a more political view of white people. Despite the fact that the historical impact has declined the book is remarkable easy to read and the imagery is startling. It is probably a good bridge for children to move from kids to adult literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in my English class recntly, all I haver to say is that this is a very good book, but just as annoying to read.

If you have a lot of time to reread this book and to think about it all the time, then buy it.

It tells of the gradual destruction of the human nature. I can't tell whether the book is for children or for adults. The plot of the book is simple enough but the message Golding tried to give is very serious.A group of British schoolboys gets marooned on an uninhabited island while they were being transported to a safer place during Second World War. In the course of time the boys gets split amongst themselves and form two groups. Eventually their hostile attitude turns to war.The title \`Lord of the Flies' is very vague. You won't get the meaning of it till you have read the book. In fact you get to know who or what the lord of the flies is after reading more than half of the book.

It made for great debates, numerous conversations, and a laugh for everyone in my small english class. For a mandatory book it was worth my time, obviously, but I did find small inklings of spirituality and realism held within the pages of this book pages. To keep this short and sweet: If its mandatory, read it and then complain. If you're lookin' for a good book: keep lookin', but I will say this, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; allows a very interesting point of view on life and the world. The step from a small world of kids warring against each other, into a larger world of adults doing the same: warring. The loss of innocense could have been portrayed in 5 pages or less, but the author drags it out in a dramatic way making it all the more prone to being criticized."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This wicked parable of society is firmly in the top 10 novels of the 20th century.If you're reading this, I'll assume you're one of the presumably few people that didn't read this at some point for high school or college (by the way - it's definitely not appropriate for ages younger than high school). If so, there's no excuse for not picking it up immediately.It starts, famously, with English schoolboys in an airplane crash on a deserted island in the wake of nuclear war (and - lest we be too hard on the boys - this point is deliberately made to show that adults fared no better than the boys will). The pilot, the only adult on board, is killed - and the boys have to create a civilization from scratch.Eventually factions are formed, and tensions arise between the \\"rescue\\" faction led by a boy named Ralph, which focuses on keeping their shelters in repair and a signal fire burning, and the \\"hunting\\" faction led by a boy named Jack, which becomes less focused on prioritizing rescue and slowly start to like their hunting a little too much...Eventually the rescue faction dwindles to Ralph; Piggy, a stereotypical nerd who nevertheless becomes Ralph's firmest ally in keeping some kind of order; Sam and Eric, two basically decent twins and Simon, a kind, painfully shy epileptic who has the firmest handle on what's really happening to them.With things spinning out of control, Ralph and Piggy confront Jack to try to restore a semblance of sanity, while Simon faces psychic battle with the Lord of the Flies, who represents - depending on the reader - Simon's prodigious understanding of chaos, the evil within not only all the boys but all of us, the devil himself, or all three, which are not mutually exclusive.A dark, disturbing masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This really looks to be very cheaply printed.

Mostly everything in this book, has a double meaning, or stands as a symbol for something else in the world. Even the characters in the book, if you think about it, stand for some kind of person or some kind of stereotype of a person. The island that they crash land on is an allegory, or a symbol of the world. I think that the conch shell stood for authority, and in the world, would have been the government. This is an awesome book for people who like finding the deeper meanings of things, and for people who take the time to analyze novels. While you are reading this book, I would suggest that you take the time to analyze and think about the comparisons the author is making."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion,I thought this was a real interesting book. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book is that everything has a deeper meaning then you think. You have to try to thinik beyond what the words say and you have to have a big imagination. The only thing I didn't like about the Lord of the Flies is the deaths that occur in the story. I say this because I prefer to read happy and cheery books and the deaths in the story sort of brought me down.I think other people would also like this book. I say this because most readers like to read books that they can relate to, and in this story there are a wide variety of people that anyone can compare himself or ferself to."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book was really boring and some parts were hard to understand for me.But the book was overall a very interesting book. It talks about the defects on human beings and it makes you think that if you were on the boys' shoes which side of you would come out:the evil or the good. Or if you would become a savage just like they did.But in the end you realize that ,that's how the real world is."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that Lord of the Flies is a very good book it has a meaning and has very neat relations to our world .When you stop and think about it Lord of the Flies teaches you a good lesson about the way we live and it shows that when you stick people in dier situations their true character comes out. I mean it is crazy how the boys are fighting and what saves them is a killing machine, its almost like its a continuous circle.I really like this book it kept me on the edge of my seat. How mean some of the boys were made me mad. I thought it was really sad that ralph told everyone the fat boys name was Piggy and you never really find out his name through the story. If anything in this book bugged me it would be the fact that it doesn't continue on and tell you what happens to everyone. The part in the book that stuck out to me the most was the death of Simon because it was intense, I thought it had such meaning and depth, because it was the death of all reason. I loved that when simon died Golding said the trees and water drained color, becuase it was such a great personification. I would say all the similes, personifications, and metaphors as well as the main plot and what the story stood for really caught my attention. I wonder if this book would be re-written in about 20 years if anything would change? i wonder if the nature of people would change? This book is great and I would give anyone the advice to read it because you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a good book for young readers.In the book it explains how no political system by itself is strong enough to shape society.

The reason that I liked this book was that Golding did a good job of making the book and allegory and he used the characters to show human nature how it can be good but mostly savage. I would think that people that like this book are the people that like to read story for the deep meaning and not have everything told to them and use their imagination when they are reading a story.

Also main objects in the book have deeper meaning and stand for something in the world. The island that the boys crash land on is an allegory to the Earth. The conch shell is govenment.

I have not reread it in the twenty years since, but it has remained vividly in my memory. I feel the greatest merit of the book is its richness of potential interpretations.A favourite of my own is an anti-communitarian reading in which Golding demonstrates the peril in the way Ralph conciliates Jack after his defeat in the leadership ballot: \`The Choir [the distinct cultural minority] is yours, of course, ... they can be ... hunters'. The result is that Simon, a choir member, is given to the hunters as a sacrifice, when, had he been protected in the pursuit of his individual ends, he would have served society better by being able to announce his discovery of the nature of the beast, freeing the boys from the terror that played its part in pushing them towards barbarism.Another ironic light can be seen in the passage in which Ralph dogmatically insists on the importance of maintaining a fire, but cannot remember why. He has to be reminded by Piggy, that it is a signal for rescue. When considered against the nuclear war background, this is a haunting reminder of the nuclear scientists who chose to work on the Manhattan Project to secure a nuclear bomb as a deterrent against a nuclear Third Reich, but became so absorbed in the means that they omitted to reevaluate them periodically against the ends."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the book wasn't believable enough to relate it to anyones life. Yes, it does have its points about life, but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's(William Golding) purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that &quot;there is a need for civilization and rules.&quot; I do agree with him. The book's high points are the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules. Murder, theft, and violence are all products of no civilization, and that is shown in the book. The best literary element in this book is the characters. Golding described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While, on the hand, the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones, they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book, the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game, not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golden's Lord of the Flies is a classic. When my 13 year-old grandson said he was reading it in school, I ordered it on my kindle so we could read and discuss together.There is a certain naivet&eacute; in Golden's, writing style. Perhaps it is the British to American language nuance or possibly, it is his mastery of writing that presents the essence of the story with naivet&eacute;, for indeed, in the beginning, the boys are innocent, only becoming more savage as the book progresses and the leaders (Ralph and Jack) strive for order and then control.I find it interesting to read this story as an adult. As a youth, I recall it being an decent story of survival among the elements as well as each other. As an adult, I can step back and see how the story depicts the evolution of 'man'hood and politics teeming with greed and lust for power. I do wonder where the story would have taken us if it had been young girls who found themselves on an uncharted island-now there's a story to be told."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a novel written by William Golding, a renowned (now dead) British-born writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1983. He also won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1980. Lord of the Flies is of course a classic, a famous novel written by a war-hero. Golding saw the bloodshed spilled in Normandy at D-day when the allied forces invaded Wehrmacht-occupied France. I believe that Golding took with him several of his experiences in the violent war that was World War 2 when he wrote Lord of the Flies. The plot of the novel can be described as a literary version of In the Hall of the Mountain King, the situation that the main person (Ralph) is in gets worse and worse for every page in the book and the dance keeps on getting more and more intense.Lord of the Flies is actually a really scary book and if you read the lines of the book over and over again you will see that the book is indeed a recipe for evil acts. I am no christian but you will find that all the Seven Deadly Sins are in the book. Envy of powerful Ralph, pride of hunting, wrath of killing, greed and power, gluttony of meat, acedia: Not caring about the state of the environment (fire, rescuers etc.) and a lack of women (lust)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"[This is an old review, lost in the amazonian jungle, now reposted at the request of the Lord of the Gadflies.]The two boys we meet on the first page of \\"Lord of the Flies\\", Ralph and Piggy, are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed, they are pre-modern, utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of \\"creation myths\\" from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature, which is depicted as innately savage, held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by \\"rules\\".Reading \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer, though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But: A) they're in a garden paradise; B) \`Woman' has not yet been created; C) fratricide, the Cain and Abel story, is central; D) Yahweh, in the form of a Grown-Up British naval officer, makes his judgmental appearance in the end.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" can also be read as science-fiction. Most critics have taken it as an apocalyptic parable, an \`end of the world' scenario, with the boys as the only visible survivors of a world war. End of humankind, beginning of humankind, take your choice! Of course, without girls, without Eve, humankind wouldn't amount to much. If, indeed, the boys were being transported to the island, or to some other custodial location, the reader will have to puzzle out the survivalists' intent. If, on the other hand, these boys -- all British but of mixed ages -- were on a flight somewhere and were stranded on the island by a crash, the questions brim up faster than the tide. Why didn't any of them know where, why, how, or what? On a plane of the size Golding could have imagined, wouldn't they have at least noticed each other while boarding? The \`creation myth' reading eliminates some of those questions; the boys popped into existence on the island without real-time antecedents, even though they were created with the illusion of prior-life memories.Implausibility in the cause of plot development is one of the constant weaknesses of second-rate science fiction. \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" is riddled with implausibilities small and large. My guess is that William Golding had less than no experience with the outdoors, other than English playing fields. Let's get persnickety for a moment: 1) The boys start a fire INSTANTLY with sunlight through the lens of Piggy's glasses; Hah! I'd like to see that done! 2) The naked or nearly naked boys, with their tender English feet, scamper over coral and volcanic rocks all a-jumble, and through palm and bramble thickets, at the speed of thought on the typewriter keys; Golding had clearly never attempted hiking off-path in his life! 3) The island is straight out of Disneyland! If it's big enough to support a population of wild hogs, to have running streams of fresh water, and to feature a peak as high as described, then the boys COULD NOT possibly cover the territory they do in the time they're allotted, any more than Jack Bauer could drive from edge to edge of Los Angeles during a commercial break! If the island is as small as it has to be for the final \`hunt' to make sense, then it's too small for any other item of the story to compute. There are also some ecological illogicalities, the strangest of all being the presence of those pigs without any history of human settlement. Honestly, as a narrative of \`survival' in a hostile or indifferent environment, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is less realistic than \\"The Hatchet\\", Gary Paulsen's classic for young readers.In short, William Golding knew absolutely NOTHING about nature! And knowing nothing about Nature, how can his depiction of Human Nature be considered meaningful?That's the burning question for me, in reading this rather childish portrayal of the innate bestiality -- the \\"original sin\\" -- of our species. Frankly, I think \\"The Lord of the Flies' is fatally dated; it's a specimen of the mindset of the year it was published, 1954, at the beginning of the Great Fear of nuclear destruction. It dates from an era when the implications of evolution were just beginning to dawn on middle-class literary Joes like Golding, but long before any combination of ethology and evolutionary psychology had begun to probe the roots of social-ethical behavior.Is it still worth reading? Yeah, it's kinda fun. Does it have depths of insight in the human dilemma? None that I can take seriously. Should it be a standard reading choice for school children of any particular age, as it has been? Is it actually a book intended for \\"young readers\\"? I'll have to leave those questions for teachers to consider."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you haven't already done, stop everything you're doing and read this book.

The book is one of my favorite books of all time and I was very excited that Golding himself was the one who was reading the story. After listening to the cds myself, however, I was a bit reluctant to have my students listen to any of them. Golding was a brilliant writer, but he was also a terrible reader. He reads in a very dull and rather monotone voice with hardly any inflection. Surprisingly, my students really enjoyed listening to the chapters we listened to in class (I think that's because it cut down on the reading they actually were supposed to do themselves). Also, at the end of the book Golding has about a four minute piece where he explains how the idea for LORD OF THE FLIES came about and where he talks about the major themes of the novel. I don't recommend this audio book for anyone who wants to listen to the book themselves; you're better off trying to find a reading done by someone else.

It is just as good as I'd hoped it would be. This book is a classic because it works on several levels--as allegory, as social commentary, and as just plain good storytelling. What more can I say that hasn't already been said?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've put off reading this book for awhile. No reason really, I had heard good things about it, that it was full of symbolism, etc. So now, I've finally gotten around to reading it and while I do admit it was chock full of symbolism, I didn't find it particularly engrossing and even a bit dull.After a wreck, a group of boys twelve years and younger are stranded on an island. From the first they are eager to make their own society without the yoke of adults while still secretly yearning to be rescued. A boy named Ralph is made head of this society, with Jack, a leader of a choir group turned hunters as his somewhat second in command. He also has a somewhat adviser dubbed Piggy who owns a pair of glasses that is the main source for creating fire. As the boys live on the island their society starts to deteriorate and fears make the boys do things that no one would have ever thought them capable.Ralph is a weird leader for the group. He seems, in the beginning, to be more along the same lines of personality as Jack. A bully in a way, but really just a normal boy otherwise. Piggy is the typical picked on kid, who has aspects of him that are important to share but are ignored by society based on superficial reasoning. And Jack, well he's the type that's filling up our prisons or operating under camouflage as a socio-path in the normal world. It's just in this world he is allowed to have the savagery come out. Ralph's experience with leading causes him to miss the socio-pathic role, but he could have come very close if he had made a few decisions in a different way. And then there's Simon, who's supposed to be the enigma of the group, but who's really just a sick little boy that is looked at differently because of his issues.Golding uses this book to show a number of things. The bleakness in society, the potential for violence in anyone, and that without consequences to rules, society could fall apart quite easily. But there were a couple things I didn't understand. For one, I never really realized why it was all boys that were stranded on the island, especially since they weren't all traveling as part of the group like the choir was. Why did they go to savagery so quickly? Especially when you consider the amount of younger kids. And what about their feelings of home and wanting to get back there? Surely after a week or so the fun of playing on their own island would have abated and a depression would have set in. And that just seems unaccounted for. While I thought Golding made some good points about society and how it works, I just think it could have been fleshed out more.And the writing itself. For all the violence and gore, I found it dull. Just the style was hard to follow because of the way it jumped about. And while part of that can be attributed to following the actions of young boys, it was just jarring to read and made it easy to lose focus. And I know this book could actually be geared to middle school and high school aged children but I wonder if the majority have the ability to really get at all the symbolism in this book or if they'll be so distracted by the gore that it'll be missed. Certainly there are some very intelligent kids out there that will get it, but not everyone is like that. Heck, I'm an adult and I probably didn't catch half of what Golding put in there.There are some lessons in here, but it just wasn't the right platform for me. I didn't like Golding's writing style and it caused me to hurry through a book that should have time spent on it to get at the detail.Lord of the FliesCopyright 1954182 pagesReview by M.

The plot is quite interesting. It's about 2 planes filled with British kids crashing on a deserted island. First of all, these kids would have died in a few weeks at the most! There is NO way normal men could kill wild boars, let alone young kids. Weapons are hard to make too, I don't know how the older young boys, around the age of 13, can make weapons that is sufficient and adequate enough to use for killing wild boars and other fierce creatures. This book is extremely far-fetched as I see it. But there are interesting elements too, I suppose. It's very symbolical. There's some symbols that I didn't fully interpret until I look into them closer, and I thought that was quite intriguing. It brings a more dark atmopshere into this book. One star for symbolism, and another one is to be respective for the effort of this book being made."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the notes to the copy of the book that I read, Golding said that &quot;The theme of the book is an attempt to trace the defects of Society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.&quot;This seems to me to be profoundly wrong. Ethics and morality are a function of the political system that society's adopt, not vice versa. Golding would have done well to read Hobbes' Leviathan. Hobbes makes the much more convincing case that for man in the state of Nature, life was &quot;Nasty, brutish and short&quot;. So man traded off a certain amount of autonomy to a central authority in exchange for protection from other men. Morality then flows from the political structures that men adopt.Take an example on a smaller scale: the morality of informing. In criminal enterprises the informer (rat, squealer, snitch) is immoral because the enterprise depends on secrecy--i.e., the Mafia , Revolutionary/Terrorist groups, crooked cops, the Clinton White House--and anyone who parts the veil of secrecy is demonized, because informing endangers the entire structure. In the normal run of life we are fairly conflicted about informing, we don't honor the informer (Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, Whittaker Chambers, Frank Serpico, Linda Tripp) but we do seek to protect them from retalliation by their bosses via whistleblower laws. While in totalitarian societies informing against those who oppose the state (even if it's your parents) is a heroic act. Golding would have us believe that these differences are the result of the innate ethical natures of the members of the societies. In fact, it is the agreed upon structure of the societies that determines what behavior is accepted as ethical.GRADE: C"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this book offering a somewhat scary look at society.

Going off--hunting pigs--letting fires out--and now!\\"If we consider that in this novel there is not a feminine figure I can argue that the human being (after the nuclear conflict) is almost destined to disappear because the female is a crucial part of the society not only as a synonymous of reproduction but mainly as the most rational and intelligent part of the humanity (See Piggy and Jack).\\"The Conch\\" is synonimous of democracy made of condivisible and established a priori made of rules but is also extremely fragile.In my opinion \\"The Beast\\" is a radiography of our souls which is localized somewhere inside our minds, after a series of facts it will emerge violently the animal side of our personality.CheersIP"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In William Golding's novel The Lord of the Flies, a group of twelve year old boys are stranded on an island in the midst of a war. Golding has chosen the perfect setting and age group to illustrate his point. By using twelve year old boys instead of grown men, he is able to better explore the human tendency towards cruelty (as these twelve year olds do not have civilization fully ingrained into their natural instincts). The allegorical nature of the novel worked in Golding's favor; the reader clearly understands that Golding believes that humans are not born pure and moral -these traits are learned over a long period of time.Because Golding meant the novel to be allegorical, it is not very realistic. The characters Ralph, Piggy, and Jack seem to be rather flat, as we know next to nothing about them. Also, these children barely mention missing their families or their old lives. In fact, most of them readily abandon it without a second thought to explore their inner savage. The island the boys are stranded on also happens to have plenty of fruit; the boys' overwhelming desire for meat, especially at such a young age, seems out of place. The reader must employ some pretty serious suspension of belief while reading this novel. Ultimately however, these traits helped contribute to the novel's strong and incredibly complex symbolism which leaves the reader to ponder over the true nature of human behavior."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I started reading this, a young friend of mine looked at the cover and groaned. \\"I had to read that in high school,\\" he said.

The best and the worst of human behavior comes to the surface. What made the copy I read most interesting was the comments made by the author about why he wrote about boys, and how he came up with the story line.Now, to go back to my young friend and beat up on him for complaining ... ! I wish I'd read this book when I was in high school."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You can always think, \\"Oh what a enjoyable thing to do,\\" with most adventure books. Not with this one. When a group of boys crashes on an island they are supposed to take this opportunity to make a dream society. In Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, that definitely does not happen. Instead, kids turn savage and no one can tell good from evil.During World War II, a group of boys' plane crashes on an island. Only the boys survive. Everything seems ideal - there are no adults around and there appears to be enough food and water. But what happens when all the food and water runs out? The boys decide to have an election on the leadership of their tribe. It so happens that a boy named Ralph gets elected and appoints his opponent Jack to be the leader of the hunters. But then Jack wants more. He wants to be the leader. He takes all the boys (except Ralph, Samneric, and Piggy) and turns them into savages. Jack and his co-leader Roger think they are doing good for the boys who want to have fun, but then the signal fire goes out. The hope of a rescue is gone. Now Jack and Roger candidly pursue Ralph, Piggy and Samneric. What will happen if one of them gets captured?I think that the two main points of Lord of the Flies are firstly, that being evil is easier than being is good. When you are evil your conscience goes away - you don't feel bad for people you hurt. The only feeling you have left is for yourself and then sometimes you don't know that you hurt people. When you are good it is possible to feel for others. Secondly, I think that William Golding is trying to make a point that an evil society can't last. Sure, it can form easily, but it can't last. This is because evil is an all wanting thing. If you are evil you probably will try to get to the top by force while other people are doing the same thing. Then every bit of structure falls to bits and pieces."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is every young boy's dream- being left on a coral island with no parents or grownups to tell them what to do. It all begins quite nicely with order and with Ralph as the elected chief. Rules are created and jobs are divided amongst the boys. But things tip into chaos very quickly when a second anarchical faction rises up among the boys. They quickly descend into savagery and Ralph and his friend Piggy are the lone representatives of reason and law. Human nature shows its most sinister side and all hell breaks loose. There is a mysterious 'beastie' inhabiting the island which provokes fear in all the boys, big and small. But the beastie is really themselves and how they behave towards each other when they throw law and order to the wind. It is the ugliness inside all of their hearts which they have allowed to run free. This book was definitely an eye opener for the dark side of human nature and makes you think if this is what would happen if the world suddenly turned into a similarly lawless place."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies inspired vigorous debate in my high school English class, and the Peter Brook film version certainly did the book justice. It's interesting sometimes to turn to a piece of literature that you know already and experience it as an audiobook. In this case, I didn't see the Peter Brook film as I listened, nor did I have the same response to the book that I had as a student. This was a completely fresh take on a classic that remains controversial in its assertion that a society built and populated by mankind is destined to fail because innate human weakness will triumph over higher notions. It's a chilling view, and I, for one, can't prove that Golding was wrong. We have only faith in human goodness to keep anarchy from prevailing. Is that faith only possible when one can afford it?Lord of the Flies"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is beautifully written. Some parts of his book are like poetry the way he describes some scenery or some emotion. I enjoyed this book immensely. Leave an island stranded with a bunch of boy growing and on the verge of manhood you can see how man will intend to mean well. But free will and the feel of power and control one can lose sight of the original goal and turn for the worst. You can see how evil men gain power, by fear and promise of better. It was fast paced and book I had trouble putting down. Excellent read if you want to read in to double meanings."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when I was in my late teens, and once I started it I couldn't put it down. The action of the boys on the island is riveting and highly suspenseful. Alliances are formed, the group divides into two gangs, each trying to outdo the other. It's inevitable that something terrible is going to happen, caused by one group trying to wrest supreme leadership from the other. When that something terrible did happen, I was shocked . . . but I recognized that the entire book was leading toward what happened. I think this is an exceptionally well-imagined book, and an exceptionally well-plotted one. If your read this book, I suspect its story will stay with you forever. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I purchased this for my son as part of his summer reading.

I was not required, but chose to read this book. I thaught that it would be somewhat interesting... I was dead wrong.First of all, Golding is one of the dullest writers ever. For example, he could explain how the tide of the beach would move, or how the sun sets and rises for 2 pages (this isn't exaggeration). Yet he can sum up one of the boy's death in less than half of a page.Second, if you've got something to say about society, don't use teenagers to say it. He obviously knows nothing about the way that real children would act. For example, when the savage boys kill one of the main characters in the story, they don't say anything like, \\"Oh my gosh we've just killed somebody!\\", they do say things like, \\"See what we did? Thats what we'll do to you!\\"He explains about a monster, \\"The Beasty,\\" very briefly. You never get to find out what it is, why it's there, or even what it represents.Even if you are some kind of deranged man who likes to read about the deaths... no... killings of little children, I still wouldn't recomend ths book for you. It is too dull to keep up with.Don't think of me as some bratty little kid just trying to bring the score of this book down either.

You only need to flip through a history book to see the horrible things people have done to other people. But to read about twelve year old boys killing each other is really sick. And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race.

The tale of Ralph and his boys is so real that it is horrifying. Golding has a way of seeing how things would really happen without society and government. He places a group of all boys on a deserted island to fend for themselves. being on an island, the boys have no way of escaping. At first the boys develop rules and a sort of loose society, but then when jack get his hunters to join him so they can hunt and have fun, everything falls apart. Jack and his hunters turn savage and eventually burn the whole island. Golding portrays mans natural state as being savage rather than human as we know it. He suggests that if left alone, man will regress into the animals that we once were. Jack and his hunters actually stalk the pigs on all fours like animals. They paint there faces and when they kill pig, they dance and chant. No high school student can understand the reality of our true nature until they read lord of the flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is a deep, complex book that can be read at many levels. If the book is read at an elementary level, it is merely an adventure story, but at the upper levels and college level, it is a satire that grips the reader and illustrates the reality about human nature. The story is set during World War II, where a plane carrying young British children crashes on a remote island. The children initially try to organize themselves, as you would expect highly civilized, British children to do. But then, some of these children realize that they are in complete control, that there are no adults on the island to monitor what they are doing, and this is when the primitive human nature starts to take over. They start with killing pigs and eating them half raw, blood dripping everywhere, and they end up killing three innocent children until they were rescued by none other than a cutter, which just goes to show the warring, disgusting, and primitive nature of humans that they have no control over. Golding uses this novel to introduce to us our basic and primitive instincts that emerge in the absence of civilization. He wants to show us that man is born into sin and he is a fallen creature by nature.A special part of the story is the symbols. The Conch that Ralph uses to call the others is seen as a symbol of authority. Whoever has the conch is the leader, and when the conch is destroyed in a tussle, it signifies Jack's victory; civilization is out. The forest on the island itself becomes a symbol of the location of darkness and evil. There are so many literary features to this novel that it makes it a joy to read. Easily one of the best books I've ever read.-David Brehm"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book, Lord of the Flies, by William Golding is a highly symbolic book based in the 1960's, about a group of pre-teenage boys from Britain, who's plane crashes onto an uncharted island during a nuclear war. As the book progresses, you seemingly endure the same disagreements, hardships, and means of survival that the boys do. While this book has points where the children are able to compromise and put up with one another, the majority of the reading is that of the boys and their constant disputes and violent actions toward one another.There are four main characters in the book, Ralph, Jack, Simon, and Piggy, who all have symbolic meanings. Ralph is the leader elected by the boys. Jack is a self centered, arrogant, and whiney kid, who wants things to go exactly as he wants them, and turns to violence when they don't. Simon is the only person in the book who is genuinely good, fearless, and accepts people the way they are. And, Piggy is an intelligent misfit, who uses common sense and logic in his thinking and reasoning.When the book commences, the boys are simply innocent children, who know nothing outside of their everyday home life. The boys quickly realize that in order to survive, they must acquire the skills and knowledge that are essential to live. Ralph, for example, realizes the importance of a signal fire and shelter, whereas Jack feels that hunting is top priority. Due to the constant fighting, the boys eventually segregate into two groups, and battle one another in a \\"survival of the fittest\\" type mind set. In the remainder of the book, the boys continue to battle with one another, which in turn leads to the final outcome.On a scale from 1 to 5, (1 being the worst), I would rate this book a 3. I feel that the book is a great tool for the classroom, but is not one that I would choose to read independently. This fictional story is educational in the sense that is it highly symbolic and has numerous literary elements, but is not the type of genre that I prefer. I do feel however, that it was an extremely well written book, that makes you think on a totally different level than normal. It causes you to \\"read between the lines\\" and dig deeper to find the hidden symbolic meanings that Golding strategically wrote about. I recommend this book to teachers for classroom use, and to anyone who would like to take on an extremely challenging and highly symbolic book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've read this book twice (almost completely) and love everything about it. The way Golding set it up innocently using young boys as a warning to the entire world they better watch out, the concept is not so far fetched.The book starts simply enough, stranded boys on a deserted island where they must learn how to survive or perish. First the initial shock of where and how and why passes and soon enough you see the boys imitating their civilized upbringing by creating their own set of rules and laws, establishing a hierarchy in order to survive. A marvelous concept considering they are on a stranded island with no adults, no one telling them they can't play; possibly showing the boys are capable of reason and adapting despite their age and maturity.The book reads fast and has a message for the reader, and for anyone willing to listen, honestly. Upon devouring the words I hadn't read in over ten years from the first time, I realized a lot was missed the first time around and that might be the point. Don't take things for granted because it just may end up flipping on you and you are left holding the short end of the stick. I think Golding did have a message and I truly wonder if people understood it.As stated in the title, I love this book. It is a true &quot;classic&quot; and a must read for anyone. I do question why 14 and 15 year-olds must read it, for at that age I didn't understand or care for the topic. The second time around though, I did understand and welcome the topic. Every page left me wanting another, praying these kids understand before it's too late. Unfortunately, there is an emotional connection between me and this book keeping me from picking it up again. Sometimes fiction imitates life too much and at the point in the book where Piggy and Ralph go searching for Piggy's glasses, I learned two planes slammed into the World Trade Towers. What a time and place for symbology.Nevertheless, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is an excellent book, maybe one of these years I'll pick it up again after the emotional ties to it are a bit more removed, but I feel everyone should read it at least once."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have watched \\"horror\\" movies that scared me less than this book did. Equal parts \\"Robinson Caruso\\" and \\"Children of the Corn,\\" \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding explores our human nature in a way not seen before.Stranded on a uninhabited island, a group of young English boys are left to survive without the influence of an adult. Chaos slowly materializes as the boys gradually lose track of their main goal: to be rescued. Nighttime comes to sybmolize fear and death as a mysterious \\"beast\\" rears its ugly head. Ralph and Piggy struggle to remain \\"civilized\\" while Jack and others begin to be absorbed by their animalistic urges.One thing that stood out to me was Golding's use of imagery. From the tiniest details of the island to almost palpable tension that devolops on the island, Golding does a magnificent job of portraying it all.However, the aspect of this book that makes it outstanding is the psychology behind the story. As the children begin to fully realize that there are no adults to give them guidance, a darkness falls over them. Long term survival becomes secondary to the immediate need to have \\"fun.\\" The children evolve from being hunted to being vicious hunters.I highly recommend this as both a good story and as a psychological study. I believe it could be an invaluable guide for high school students leaving home for the first time and experiencing a sense of freedom that can parallel that of the boys in this novel. Even if you are well past that stage, it's worth reading to get an understanding of what people might be experiencing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This classic tale has stood the test of time not only because it is beautifully written, but because it takes a revealing look at basic human nature, both good and bad. Golding uses the circumstance of teenage boys marooned on a tropical island by a plane crash to illustrate in exciting detail how some react to conflict and adversity. The flawed &quot;society&quot; the boys develop in their quest for survival is a microcosm of our modern civilized world. Lessons and questions abound in his masterful prose--without preaching or pretense.This book is much more than just a story; it is art. It's one those pieces of literature that add to culture and foment introspection in young readers. In a small way, the world is a better place because of Lord of the Flies. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didn't paticularly enjoy Lord of the Flies, but I must admit, it was fairly interesting... Lord of the Flies is a novel about a bunch of young boys deserted on an island with no adults or the presence of society, and all the complications that go with that. The whole book is a fight between right and wrong, order and chaos, and intellect and instinct-- Golding was trying to show just how much evil people have hidden inside covered by society, or in other words, that the only reason we ALL aren't savages is because society is always telling us we shouldn't be... A very interesting thought, one that I do in a way stand behind, but the actual PLOT and STORY of Lord of the Flies disappointed me, so I don't believe you should take the time to read the entire book; just maybe the afterword written by Golding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While the outside world is destroying itself in World War III, a group of pre-teen boys mimics the destruction of civilization in microcosm. They have a leader who can't get people to cooperate, they prove to be a people who are ultimately more interested in sport (hunting) and religion/superstition (the beast) than rescue, and who hate, torment, and eventually kill the only intellectual among them. They reject the law (symbolized by the beautiful conch the leader sounded to call meetings) in favor of rule by violence, and they take a blood-thirsty new leader -- who used to be head boy in a choir!So who's the Lord of the Flies? One of the boys sees him in the decaying, flyblown head of a dead hog. He sees a god of death, destruction, and decay who lives in all of us and who, given the opportunity, breaks free and destroys much of what makes life beautiful. It lives in us all -- great and small -- and we all contain the seeds of our own destruction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Admittedly, it has been nearly a decade since I read &quot;Lord,&quot; and at the time I enjoyed it, even though I was too young to understand what was being said. The fact is that, at the time, I thought the book lagged at times, which is deadly to a casual young reader, as I was. When I think about what I remember of the book now, its kind of mysogynistic. I recommend it, marginally, though I plan to buy a new copy (my old one went the way of Piggy) and give it another go as an adult. I would suggest &quot;Animal Farm&quot; over this, if the symbolic or allegorical content is what you are looking for. Or, if you like this kind of stuff and dont mind reading some non-fiction, you might considder looking up the Stanford prison experiment (the event, not the band)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I bought this book to use for my next book report, thinking,&quot;Why must we always read boring 'classics'?&quot; This one certainly wasn't dull! It was about a group of British schoolboys who were plane-wrecked on an uninhabited island. Ralph,a &quot;bigun&quot;,tried to lead and create a semblance of civilization,with the corpulent,wise Piggy as his assistant. It didn't work for long. One boy,Jack,rebelled and gathered up his own band of painted savages. There were horrible casualties(I won't say who). &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is scarier than any horror novel I've ever read, because the events in it are feasible. Government and rules merely veil the evil in every person. We must try to further suppress this force with love so the human race doesn't suffer the same fate as these British boys. It may sound corny,but to love takes more strength than painting ourselves as savages. Back to the book itself. It was very deep and made me lose some of my innocence. Reading it was a life-changing experience. I read it avidly,eager to see what would happen next. The end made me breathe a sigh of relief. I reccomend this book to mature,brave readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Stranded on an island alone as a twelve year old; how would you survive? That's the question author William Golding poses to us in his adventure novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\". While escaping WWII in England, a plane of British school boys is shot down, and they suddenly find themselves alone on a deserted island with no parental supervision. Now completely alone, the boys begin to assemble on the beach with the help of a determined young boy, Ralph. You will follow the power struggle between two twelve year olds from beginning to end, who both want to take charge of all the children on the island. Soon the boys take sides, and begin to form two separate tribes, and the attention is deviated away from the major goal, getting off the island. This book will hold your attention throughout with the impending question on your mind; will they make it off, and back to safety? Golding does an exceptional job of creating an action thriller that you won't put down until the very last page."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The lord of the Flies, by William Golding, is a very interesting and exciting novel that has many double meanings and symbolism by the characters and their actions. The kids in the book represent how mankind would be without any rules or restictions. It shows how as a society we could not function without the presence of a formal government. The boys that get stranded on the island, quickly forget about the laws that they used to abide by. They become savages on this island and soon violience becomes an everyday occurance. The kids would of continued their savage behavior if not for the interference from the outside wolrd. Symbolism is a big part of this book. Most ideas in this book should not be taken literally. The island that the kids landed on represents the world. The conch represents law and democracy. The conch is the only thing that all the kids listen to and follow. When ever they hear it they always meet. The \\"beast\\" represents the darkside within everyone. The beast does not actually exist. It is just the kids excuse for violence and death. This book exposes human nature and how we would act if not for the laws that we are forced to follow. When the stronger kids see that they can get power, they do anything to achieve it. They do not care if they have to kill oposing forces. Overall I enjoyed this book because it made you think why we need a central government that tells us what to do. Without it there would be chaos, which is what happened in the the book, The Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of The Flies is a grappling book that will keep you turning pages.

There's Ralph who is the leader, he tries to keep everyone together and have hopes. But Jack the ruthless power monger wants people to follow him. In all this, Piggy with his wisdom always has good advice to share. On the island these boys are stranded, how do they get food, how do they survive, also is there something evil lurking on the island. William Golding's book is still a very popular book, it has over 7 million copies in print since 1954. This book is simply astonishing, it puts real boys in a situation to survive the unforgiving nature. \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a page turner that will make you want more. As you see civilized boys turn into power hungry, bloodthirsty savages. This book shows how out society crumbles without proper guidelines, rules, and modern world items we depend on.

William Golding does a fine job of not only explaining conflict between multiple people, but also conflicts in ones' self.This adventure story follows a group of boys through a fight for survival, both with each other and the land. Personally, I think this story has many individual issues to keep the reader occupied while the one major theme occurs, which is perseverence. I think this story's many different conflicts keep the reader interested by giving them something to follow that's never too distant, so they never grow bored.

Action packed and Symbolism a plenty..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, is the suspenseful and graphic story of a group of English boys stranded on an island. The book starts out with the boys already on the island. The main character, Ralph, finds a conch shell, which plays a major roll in the book, take the conch and blows on to make a loud sound that calls everyone together. Once they are all there they decided that they needed a leader and since Ralph had the shell all the little kids voted for him. The other runner in that competition was Jack, the leader of an older set of boys and the only person on the island with a knife. Ralph gave Jack and his boys the job of hunting. Another person on the island is Piggy, a heavyset boy with asthma and glasses, a very essential part of their survival. Over time some of the little kid go crazy and run away to be savages. Eventually every one leaves Ralph and he is hunted like a dog.Here are some things that were good and bad about this book. The plot seems basic at first, boys stuck on island have to survive, but then it goes deeper with mysterious creatures, hallucinations and murders. Since it had a good plot it keeps you reading. The vocabulary is another superior factor of the book. The vocabulary gives you a thorough picture in your mind of the island and it inhibiters. Also the book was only 200 pages long so it's an easy read. A not so good feature about this book is it graphic images. At some points it got so disgusting I had to stop reading and go do something else. In additional the ending was predicting. I'm not going to tell about the ending. Over all I would give this book an eight out of ten for the reasons above. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes an alternative to the basic survival story. Also the reader should be in 7th to 10th grade."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, in my opinion is the best novel everwritten. This book is a lot of fun to read. You will never wantto put the book down until you finish reading it. This book isfull of suspense, begining with the first chapter. It will haveyou on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going tohappen next. All of the characters in the book: Ralph,Piggy andJack, just to name a few are full of life and desire to be freeand not worry about anything. I recommend this book very much toeveryone. I give it a five star rating."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For a long time I couldn't fit names to characters... about halfway through the book, I finally got it straight. That might be just me, but I don't think so. Other than that, however, the book is wonderful. It's actually an easy read; I sat down and read the whole thing in two days. I love the symbolism given by the 'lord of the flies', and the rivalry that the boys end up in is very realistic. All in all, a very reccommended book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had many different opinions about this book. I enjoyed reading it, but there were so many things left untold that I wanted to know. Where was the plane? What were their lives like after this experience happened? I think if things like this were added to the book it would have made it better. After finishing the book I was left thinking about what happened later. So the ending of the book is what made me change my whole opinion of it. I would say read this book, but don't bother reading the end. Its obvious, but you don't find out near as much as you want to know!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In Lord of the Flies, his first novel, William Golding used a group of boys stranded on a tropical island to illustrate the malicious nature of mankind. Lord of the Flies dealt with changes that the boys (representing society in general) underwent as they gradually adapted to the isolated freedom from society (society's adaptation to the times). Three main characters depicted different effects on certain individuals under those circumstances.Jack Merridew began as the arrogant and self-righteous leader of a choir. The freedom of the island allowed him to further develop the darker side of his personality as the Chief of a savage tribe.Ralph, a &quot;fair haired boy&quot; started as a self-assured boy whose confidence in himself came from the acceptance of his peers. At first, his reliance upon Piggy for advice helped him maintain an orderly society. As the story progressed, it became apparent that the boys' desire for an orderly society fell wayside as the totalitarian Jack took control.Piggy was an educated boy who had grown up as an outcast. Due to his academic childhood, he was more mature than the others and retained his civilized behavior. But his experiences on the island gave him a more realistic understanding of the cruelty possessed by some people.The transition from civilized beings to a barbaric tribe illustrates Golding's view on society in his time. He believed that if we are not careful, we could revert back less sophisticated times and become animals again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is a novel that is in the same category as Animal Farm by George Orwell and Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. They are all short, easy reads that have so much more meaning that most of the novels the common reader finds. This is the type of literature that is so full of meaning that once you finish it you will wish you hadnt read it, so that you could read it once again and experience it for the first time. They are classics, and if you havent read any of them than I suggest you start ASAP!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Llies&quot;, like &quot;Animal Farm&quot; shows the rite of communism, gone sour. This book is like most revolutions that took place this century - at first, all is happy with the new liberal government, but eventually greed takes over the hearts of the leaders of the goverment, and promises turn to propoganda, and the new government is worse than the old one. In &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, Jack and Ralph emerge as the two leaders, and both of them take advantage of their intellegance and use it upon themselves to take responsibility of creating order and prevent jubior schoolboys' anarchy. Jack is the leader of the hunters, who gather meat for the tribe to eat. Ralph is responsible for the part of the tribe that is to build shelter, and to keep the fire alight. As their faith in being rescued is abandoned, they become the inhabitants of the island that they are plane wrecked on. At first, there is food for everyone, all the boys are equal and happy, enjoying the tropical climate, swimming in the lagoons, and mainly their freedom from adults. But conflict between jack and Ralph is soon aroused, and the tribe splits into two. The two tribes become rivals untill all that is left of Ralphs tribe has gone to jacks side, and what is left is Ralph and Piggy. Soon, the schoolboys are haunted by the vision of a huge beast living in the caves of the island, and this fear provokes the schoolboys to become like savage-like animals, killing and toruring the boys who disobey their leader, Jack. Piggy tries to persuade the boys to come back to reality, and to depart from their aim to destroy the &quot;beast&quot; which they have invisioned, but the boys are too anarchiac to listen. Many surprises and deaths come in this book, and I higly recomend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For this book review, I'm writing my opinion on the book \`Lord ofthe Flies'. This book has an interesting concept. A plane full of boys,literally, boys, crashes on an island. The pilot is dead, so there isabsolutely no adult supervision. Seeing this opportunity, the boys try toplot out their stay on the island, in hopes of rescue. Ralph is chosen asthe chief, which basically gives him the power of calling the shots.Ralph was the most logical out of all the boys, so it was a good decision.Ralph wasn't the only one with leadership qualities. Jack is ahunter, and that's all he wants to do on the island; he doesn't want toput in his time to get rescued. But the boys soon realize that theyweren't very willing to work together. Their personalities clashed, whichseparated Jack & Ralph. Jack's group became the \\"savages\\", hunting forpig. Ralph's group became the reasonable bunch, putting in full effortto get rescued.Are the leaders so commanding, that they may be permanentlystranded on the island- or will they find a way to put their differencesaside and work on getting rescued? Read this adventurous andunpredictable novel for your answers.***I think that this was an interesting novel. At times, you maydoze off-but Golding will bring you back with an unexpected scene. Ilike this novel because it portrays the truth with the use of ametaphor---the boys are like mankind.Can humans work together no matter their differences for apriceless prize- or are they so stubborn that they would rather workalone than with a team? Each character brings different qualities to thenovel. Ralph is the smart and obvious reasonable leader. Jack is also aleader in his own sense, but isn't willing to cooperate with others whodon't agree with his tactics. Piggy may be a coward, but he is a truefriend, until the end. I recommend this book to people who arecurious--- curious what a group of boys will do to survive when strandedon an island.***"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is my favorite of all time. It is so realistic and scary, because it is totally clear in its tactics and themes all at the same time! The characters in this novel realize by the end that humanity and goodness in the human heart does not exist. And that civility and propriety are simply facades created by the restraints of a general will in society. The characters, by the end, all face up to the darkness of human nature. What sets them apart, however, is how they react to this knowledge. Jack and his followers deal with it by killing those who are about to tell them the truth about themselves-that they are out of control and that the beast of decay, destruction, insanity, chaos and paranoia has taken over their souls and has made them as dark and evil as he is. Ralph, on the other hand, denies it right up until he is being hunted like an animal, and then accepts it with tears and sobs of grief for \\"the end of innocence, the darkness of a man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.\\" In short, this story takes us into a place that we never want to go, and tells us things that we don't want to believe about ourselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book last year (grade ten), because I was forced to read it for school. But, unlike all the other books they made us read, I ended up loving this one.The story is essentially a parody of Ballantyne's The Coral Island, which I read when I was much younger, and hated for exactly the same reasons Golding seems to have hated it when he decided to write Lord of the Flies. After reading books like The Coral Island, it's easy to understand the statement the author is making about British society, which is very amusing from a young Canadian perspective (weren't the British silly?).The book is very clever, amusing and moving. And it's not even very long, so it doesn't get boring before getting to the point.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who isn't overly squeamish. (It does involve certain acts of violence and cruelty, which tend to be the most important parts.)However, though it isn't necessary, I would recommend reading The Coral Island before Lord of the Flies, in order to understand and enjoy this book to it's fullest."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When a plane carrying a bunch of school boys crashes into an uninhabited Island, the pilot is killed and the young boys are left to fend for themselves. Immediately two leaders arise. The democrat (Ralph) and the dictator (Jack), the traits that the boys portray and the way all of the boys on the island treat each other is very much a microcosm of the society and world of America and Nazi Germany in WWII. Another bit of symbolism is with the Bible and the idea of the character Simon as a Christ figure. He is the prophet throughout the book. He warns the boys that the beast they all fear on the island is really the inherant evil of man within them, not something you can hunt and kill. He confronts the lord of the flies (a pigs head on a stick), and though he is threatened, he goes back to the boys to warn them that the beast is really them. He gives his life to preach this truth. Also the comparison of Jack with the serpant, he lures the boys away with promises of fun times an food, but he really leads them into sins like murder and greed. I think that this is a great literary classic., and has much to teach and understand in it. No matter wich way you take it this is a must read for all classic literature lovers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This year when I was handed The Lord of the Flies I remember giving a mental groan. Just what I need, another half hour of homework added to my very busy schedule. And to make matters worse my satanic English teacher was going to make us, the students teach the book. Well it turns out that the Lord of the Flies was not just another half hour of homework. It was insight into the dregs of human nature, the secret thoughts that we pretend not to think. It basically places a group of boys onto an idyllic island, adds a few pigs, some firewood, a pair of glasses, a conch, a parachutist and a generous dose of fear and savagery inherent to all humans, and documents what happens. It is a deceptively simple storyline that makes the reader examine him/herself more closely than s/he otherwise would. On the journey important questions are raised,and in the quest for answers to them I learned fundamentally important facts about myself in this period of teenage rebellion. What is survival worth? What is the cost of human advancement? How is it that our society we created is the only thing protecting us from are inherent savagery? Would I kill someone in that situation? Who am I?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After Lord of the Flies was originally released, Golding openly discussed his novel, and stated (paraphrased) that it was all nice and good that the children were rescued, but who will rescue the adults? Golding's comment, in so few words, sums up the whole novel eloquently. The novel truly is about the evil that lurks in people naturally, and that if society is not strong enough, chaos and primitive anarchy will result. In essence, we all need to be rescued. Golding's view is quite different that that of J.J Rousseau, who feels that there existed a noble savage, and that society is to blame for the exisiting problems. A very interesting read, especially the symbolism of the three main characters of Jack, Ralh, and Piggy as Freud's Id, Ego, and Super Ego. Also the character Simon is rather intriguing, as is the fate of Ralph, Simon, and Piggy at the hands of the savages. My question is: Did it matter that they were children, or would adults in the same situation reacted the same? Ponder it..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many people hate the books they read in high school, claiming that the language or subject matter is too stilted, pretentious, or just plain boring. THE LORD OF THE FLIES is none of them. Not only are the themes brilliant and stimulating, but Mr. Golding has dumbfounding mastery of the English language. Despite the fact that Mr. Golding deals with heavy, academic themes, his tone is never pretentious, and it is quite easy to read. Even for someone who is not a &quot;literary luminary,&quot; the lyricism and sheer beauty of Mr. Golding's language will have anyone spellbound. He has complete mastery over his craft. The book has an intoxicating magic, just like the forces of the id Mr. Golding depicts in his dense work. If you like to be stimulated by great ideas, or just like to read an extremely well-written story (or both) this is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It took me a while to like this book, but then I couldn't help but love it. I think this book is a classic example of what is true about ourselves only we are afraid to admit it. It shows the protective bubble society builds around our children, we close our eyes in hope of believing we live in that perfect world we all dream about. But in reality, the true nature in humans tear down that wall when it is given the chance and the inhuman creature in us all comes out. The unbelievable amount of symbolizm reflects something evil in all of us. If you are mature enough to admit the improfections within yourself and the evil part that causes hate and jeolousy then you will love this book, if you are not then it will be an eye opener for you with values to reflect on."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A terrific book, which works on many levels. I've read reviews that twitter on about the psychology of young males and so on, as if adults - and women, for that matter - would act any differently. I don't think so. We see events like those that occur in Lord Of The Flies every day. In many ways, it can be read as a study in power. We have Ralph, who does not seek power - is perhaps not truly suited to it - but has it thrust upon him. Piggy, who has the intelligence to lead well, but not the public appeal. And Jack, who wants power purely for power's sake. He sees it as his birthright, and even though he recognises his own failings, will not except anyone else as leader above himself. Ralph, it turns out, has the makings of a good leader, but it is the Might of Jack that crushes the Right of Piggy and Ralph, to the detriment of the entire community. Sounds much like the day-to-day politics of almost every Western country, doesn't it? As I said, some people see Lord of the Flies as an abstract study of the psychology of young males in an extreme situation. I see it as an example of everyday life in the history of mankind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the best books I ever read, if not the best. It displays excellent realism and a great plot. Its version of the truth about human nature is so exact, it's hard to believe it's not a true story. William Golding gets so deep in the characters minds that you know exactly what kind of person they are. This book is extremely disturbing and if you like books about cute, little puppies, this book is definitely not for you! Sorry!The climax is without a doubt the best part of the book. That's why I give Lord of the Flies five stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Book ReviewLord of the FliesBy: William GoldingNon-Illustrated 184 pagesAeonian Press $6.99(From ages 12- Death)By Matt Smetana4/19/2010In the novel, the Lord of the Flies, William Golding attempted to inform readers of the problems of a stressed civilization as well as the problems of being a full-out savage. While Ralph has good intentions with forming a civilization and have everyone working together, but not everyone wants that perfect life. The civilians feel that while they're there, why don't they have fun. On the other spectrum, savagery is outright terrible for numerous reasons. First, there are no rules and anything goes, which could end in many mistakes or injuries. In addition, you could kill people by being erratic, and not actually assessing the situation first. Golding wants to stress the different concepts and viewpoints that many children have.Golding was a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth's School until he got a few of his novels published. Such as Lord of the Flies, The Inheritors, Pincher Martin, and Free Fall. During World War II, Golding served in the Royal Navy, and played a key role in the take down of one of Germany's strongest ships.In my opinion, William Golding not only accomplished his goal, but also brought a more extensive look as to what could really happen while stranded on a deserted island. Complete isolation transformed preppy English students into savages solely concerned with their own self-preservation. The different aspects and comparisons between the false sense of civilization and the complete negativity of savagery are displayed prominently between the complete juxtaposition of Ralph and Jack. An example of Ralph's stressed mentality of civilization was shown when the kids were out trying to have fun, he barked at them to \\"get back to work.\\" On the other hand, Jack's savagery was shown when he and his gang ended up killing Piggy and Simon.One of the book's strengths was that it demonstrated exactly how children act in real life. This is one of the book's greatest strengths because it brought all of the characters to life in a relatable way. The point of this book seemed to be the most personal to me, since I have seen those things in school. One of the book's biggest faults was that it fails to convey to the reader what repercussions Jack and his crew has to face for killing two innocent kids."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I taught this book in my sophomore English class. I started each unit with a \\"free-for-all\\" day, an entire class period in which I said nothing, gave no instructions, and wore a sign that read \\"I'm closed for repairs.\\" I did this with ten different classes and each time chaos ensued. As soon as students realized I was present but not really there, they tested the limits with what they could and could not do. Since I told myself that I would only break character if a student's well-being was at stake, the students quikly realized they could get away with a lot. Leaders emerged and some kids tried to be somewhat productive, but the outcome was always dismal and disturbing. One time all the desks were piled into one heap as if they were going to be a part of one giant bonfire. This was always an interesting introduction to the book since the students quickly made the connections when they started reading the book. I am a very positive person by nature and tend to see the best in people, so some of the truths in this book are hard for me to acknowledge. However, Golding hits us with the reality of our hearts smack dab between the eyes. This book is a fascinating read that will force you to look closely within your own heart while also reminding you to be a little more cautious when trusting other people's intentions."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The plot of LORD OF THE FLIES goes something like this. During the middle of WWII, a British airplane full of male English schoolchildren is shot done over the Pacific. Upon reaching shore the survivors realize that all the adults died in the crash. The group of boys, aging in range from 6-12, bands together to survive on the island until they can be rescued. The tribe holds an assembly and elects a chief, a bright young man named Ralph. Ralph is a democratic leader and does everything he can to keep things together. He is joined in his efforts by Jack, the lead singer of a group of choir boys who turns the choir into a group of hunters; Piggy, an extremely intelligent boy who is chubby and wears glasses; and Simon, an eccentric young lad who suffers from fainting spells and seems capable of touching the spiritual world. Piggy and Jack don't get along at all. But Ralph and Jack begin things as friends. Things go alright for awhile, but there is a darkness on the island that everyone can feel. As the days pass into weeks, tension develops between Ralph and Jack. In his ambition to feed the tribe with meet, Jack slowly falls under the spell of darkness and becomes filled with pride. He eventually splits the tribe in two. Both pigs and people become slaughtered as civilization falls apart in a world of immoral and unethical chaos.LORD OF THE FLIES is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read it when I was a junior in high school and was deeply impressed by the wonderful story. The story is full of vivid images that become frozen in one's mind.Besides just being a great story, the novel can be read on a variety of levels. For instance, there is the conflict of man versus nature; civilization versus anarchy; democratic principles versus dictatorship. The book could be read as merely a psychological treatise examining the various states of the human mind. Or it can be read as a spiritual metaphor, illustrating the depravity of man outside of God's grace.Besides THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, LORD OF THE FLIES is perhaps the most influential book of the mid-20th Century. The book wasn't well received upon it's initial release, but was \\"discovered\\" in the 1960s by college students. Since that time it has become a bestseller and a modern classic. It is highly recommended and one of the few books that I believe every American should be familiar with. Beware the Beast!This edition of LORD OF THE FLIES includes an introduction by E.M. Forster, a selection of postnotes following the essay, and a group of selected critical analysis of the work."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I picked this book up for 50 cents at a thrift store. I had no idea what it was about as I have never been required to read it. I only recognized the title. Having now finished it, I can say it has been one of the most thought provoking stories I have ever read. While many have reasons to regard this as a depressing yarn of our humanity, I find myself uplifted by the message and the symbolism found throughout the novel.The story follows the adventures of a band of British boys who are marooned on an island. At first the children seem much like the lost boys of Neverland, but the world in which they live is far more real and unforgiving. The boy with the fair colored hair named Ralph is appointed the leader and with the aid of his faithful sidekick Piggy, he attempts to maintain order among the multitude of boys. What begins as simple fun on the island quickly becomes a nightmare as Ralph begins to realize that the scariest things don't come from the outside, but from within. At the end of the story all childlike innocence is lost forever.The symbolism and parallels to our time were amazing. William Golding had this to say in regards to the book's theme:\\"The theme is an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable. The whole book is symbolic in nature except the rescue in the end where adult life appears, dignified and capable, but in reality enmeshed in the same evil as the symbolic life of the children on the island. The officer, having interrupted a man-hunt, prepares to take the children off the island in a cruiser which will presently be hunting its enemy in the same implacable way. And who will rescue the adult and his cruiser?\\"While this message is among the most obvious, there are several other subtleties that can be found within the tale. The following are some of the main symbols:The conch: An effective representation of order and society's sophistication.The glasses: The glasses symbolize the gradual deterioration of society. Notice as the glasses get damaged so does the boy's organization.The beast: 1) The irrational fears we all harbor. 2) The inner evil within humanity. 3) The idols of society.Ralph & Jack: Ralph is the head of democracy while Jack represents that of anarchic rule.Just in case you missed them, there are several other symbols which are worth looking up. Wikipedia currently has a good article as well as some other sites. Run a search online and you'll find plenty of interesting interpretations. Many of the symbols can be interpreted as Christian, but make of them what you will. Observing these will give you a greater appreciation for the story and not leave you wondering if it's some senseless tragedy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Since a George Orwell reference is obviously required here, I read 'Animal Farm' directly before Lord of the Flies. And I was foolish enough to think that Animal farm is a great book! It can hardly stand on all four legs when measuring up to Lord of the Flies.Just as 'Animal Farm' is a parody of the Russian Revolution, 'Lord of the Flies' is more of a parable for mankind than an inspiration for 'Hatchet'. Every (major) character is a symbol of some aspect of human nature. And what is a literal translation of \\"Beelzebub?\\" Not devil, as you might suspect -- \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"And if the Lord of the Flies is the Devil, Simon is Christ, or pure good -- the only boy brave enough to discover what the beast really is, the only one...crazy enough to understand it, and the one who would be sacrificed by all for trying to spread the words of the Lord of the Flies.No, I did not read this book for class, thank God, or else I would most likely hate it just for that reason. I despise hearing teachers read aloud, I don't know why, and their stupid assignments (What would you do if you were trapped on an island? What would you bring?) completely miss the entire point of the book. This is not a survival story!My edition of Lord of the Flies was printed in the seventies,and it is falling apart (I found it in my dad's study in the basement). The scotch-taped cover is blank white, except for the title and a simple sketch of the head and arms of a boy, head bent like a baby, clutching his hair in anguish. He appears to be covered in blood. Is it Ralph at the beginning of Chapter 11 (you'll see what I mean)? Is it a struggling, uncertain Jack?Lord of the Flies is definitely not a survival story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel THE LORD OF THE FLIES focuses on the defects of society and their relationship with the defects of human nature. The story begins when about fifteen prep shool boys are stranded on a Utopia-like paradise island after their plane crashes. They immediately try to set up a social system like any modern-world people would. Through democracy(a vote) they crown an attractive, intelligent boy named Ralph as leader. They crown a wild, power-hungry boy named Jack and a mellow, calm, an most importantly peaceful boy named Simon as his assistant-leaders. As the novel progresses Jack, who is also the leader of the choir(the group of boys who represent the military) becomes very violent, power-hungry and mutinous and attempts several times to overthrow Ralph before finally leaving the group of boys to form a tribe of his own. This split is what drives the book forward into the amazingly complex and symbolic novel that it is. It is through this split that Golding tries to explain the main theme of his novel. This theme being of course that the defects of society can be traced back only to the defects of human nature and that shape of a society depends upon the ethical nature of the creatures that inhabit it not anything else no matter how perfect or logical it appears. With this theme set in place Golding then begins to use complex symbolism such as the symbol of the sow, who represents the human conciense,and Piggy who's glasses represent the sane, accurate view and who himself represents the sane voice of society. It is through these characterizations that Goldings novel becomes the writing of a genius. If you are a psychologyst who hasn't read this book-READ IT! If you're a person interested in the study of society read this book! Thanks, Nick McCulloch,15"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in 6th grade, as part of an \\"advanced\\" program. I wish I hadn't read it quite that early; I might have enjoyed it more. I found it hard to get past the graphic descriptions of blood and gore and to the meat of the story. I do suggest it, however; it seemed like an interesting book. (Being a 6th grade girl, I wasn't so into the \\"blood and gore, more and more\\" thing.)It does contain some disturbing subject matter, so it's probably not for kids. (Mature 8th graders and above would be my recommendation.) All in all, though, Golding describes what happens when society falls apart very vividly, and portrays the savageness of humanity gone wrong very well."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of young schoolchildren (all male) are evacuated from Britain in the wake of a nuclear war. As it turns out, their airplane has crashed onto an uninhabited island, with the result that there are no adult survivors to be found. In the opening scenes, children begin to slowly emerge from the forest and converge on the beach at the summons of the book's main character Ralph. As they are now thrust together in this new environment, it becomes apparent that a new sort of social order is going to be necessary. What follows for the length of the book is an elaborate working out of this (attempted) democratic style of social order.After an initial confrontation of two groups on the beach (one led by Ralph, the other led by Jack), Ralph is elected as leader. Early on, we see that Ralph's interests tend to be &quot;group&quot; oriented. His concern is with rescue, and with keeping the others focused on this objective through the maintenance of a signal fire. We see shadows in Jack however, that are more temporal, concerned with the hungry rumble in his stomach. And here we sense the beginnings of conflict, and the age-old fact looming to remind us that, even in democracy we need to recognize submission to elected leadership.In a pivotal chapter (ch.5) one of the children declares &quot;We're drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always a grown-up.&quot; The significance here is that, by filling his island with castaway children (rather than adults) Golding allows us to consider more aspects of innate or instinctual human nature than if it had been otherwise. Children are raw. If this island were inhabited by castaway &quot;grown-ups&quot; the results and conclusions they came to would be conditioned by all of the ingenuity, resourcefulness, and maturity with which they'd have dealt with previous struggles and needs. Socially, they would have been able to draw upon the results (good or bad) of past decisions made in the clash and clang of more mature inclinations and inhibitions. But children are not afforded this perspective of experience. Golding populates his island with children because he wants to emphasize the full range of possibilities that are INNATE in the human condition, typified in this case by Ralph's tears on the very last page. Tears, we are told, which he wept &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.&quot;With the frenzied killing of Simon in ch.9 comes the real disintegration; a rapid descent into moral anarchy. Ralph is the only one who dares to say it... &quot;That was murder.&quot; He has the keenest sense of the mob mentality that will inevitably run roughshod over the individual conscience. Earlier than any of the others he understands their own capacity for evil when he says to Piggy, &quot;I'm frightened. Of us.&quot;I had the heartrate of a chased fox in the last chapter... you will too. And when the question was flung out at the end &quot;Who's boss here?&quot;... Ralph's loud cry of &quot;I am&quot; rang through my very soul. Those two words signify the triumph of perception over ignorance.The lasting value of the book is its ability to pose the question &quot;What if I were thrust into a similar situation?&quot; Which character would I most resemble... with whom do I most identify? How is it then, that we in fact, do behave? What if?...This story speaks to any overly optimistic answer to that question when we remember that the entire reason these children found themselves on this island in the first place, was that they were fleeing a nuclear war that &quot;grown-ups&quot; had started."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was an excellent book which teaches a hard, but important lesson about human nature. When I read this book I thought it was a well thought out book with plenty of action, suspense, and disturbing turns that keeps you hooked like a horror movie or rollercoaster. Golding made a literary master piece when he wrote this story and I recommend it to anyone without a queezy stomach.The book is basically about a group of British school boys who gets ship wrecked on a deserted island, and over time the kids stop being British school boys and become vicious savages. The main character Ralph was a leader that wanted law and order. But as the kids revert to savages Jack becomes the leader and under him the kids do horrible and aweful things. Which eventually lead to the end of two children's lives. I really liked Golding's use of symbolism, such as the conch representing law and order or the Lord of the Flies representing the devil, this book is full with symbolism. The book has human turn to beast, the very thing they fear throughout the book.[...]The idea that humanity can have a dark side is very important to the growth of any kid. If we can learn that we have these instincts and there are sometimes consequences if you follow them. Then maybe we can become better at controlling them. Its also enjoyable to read if you are the type that like being scared"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read Lord of the Flies during an English Literature class I hated it. I thought that it was dry, boring and more than a little irritating. Then when I reread it more than 10 times over the course of two years and studied every single character and happenstance in depth, I began to appreciate the scope and vision of this literary masterpiece. There is no question that Golding has written one of the greatest novels in the history of time.The Lord of the Flies is at first glance a simple story of a group of boys stranded on an island who get carried away and grow \\"wild\\". Yet upon a second glance we see that it is truly a tale of \\"the end of innocence\\" and \\"the darkness of man's heart\\" (found on the last page as Ralph grieves). Golding explicitly illustrates the primeval power of human nature, a surging, uncontrollable force that let loose from its bindings of society and order, and laws, can run rampant and revert to the way it was in the beginning: complete chaos.Golding masterfully uses metaphors and symbolism throughout the book. A few important examples include the fat boy, Piggy, ridiculed by so many of the boys on the island, is depicted as \\"the voice of reason\\", while Simon, a shy and insightful boy, is depicted in a saint-like manner, a crusader for peace, a Jesus-like character who possesses the only means to bring revelation to the boys. Early on in the book, the boys find the conch, a fragile symbol of societal law and order.We eventually find that Piggy is killed, crushing the voice of reason, as is Simon, crushing hope and goodness, and the conch is smashed, relieving the small society of law and order. With all these three things gone, then darkness rages throughout the island. And who is responsible for the destruction of those three important symbols? None other than Jack, the totalitarian ringleader of his island faction, a Hitler-like representative of corruptness, greed, domination, and overall a person totally given over to the dark side of human nature.Those are just a few of the symbols that are introduced in Golding's book, throughout the novel there are a plethora of many more that require an inquisitive mind to unlock their secrets and achieve a higher level of understand of the constant battle of our existence. This is without a doubt a masterpiece. Golding has created a work of fiction that is not just suited for a younger generation of readers but also for an older generation. At any age, his darkly compelling story is enough to provoke the deepest of thoughts and introspective self-reexamination."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A very good book. A little depressing but interesting and faithful to human psychology. A very good description of what could happen to a group of human beings without the demands of civilization,"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some have derided Lord of the Flies for not being overly descriptive, but I would say that it works this way. One doesn't need to have too much detail elaborated on in order to understand the trust that developed between Ralph and Piggy when Ralph promises to give his glasses back. Some have objected to the violence, but that violence is necessary in order to examine the dangers of irresponsibility. The symbolism of the animal's skull as the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is itself perfectly punctuated so that you feel as if it's really there when Simon communicates with it as he slowly grows lethargic. Part of this novel's appeal is the different interpretations of it. Some have said that its about the need for society, but society is nothing but a collection of individuals. Others have said that it's about the need for government, but government is itself force and Jack rather than Ralph exemplifies that reality of those in positions of government. Others have said that it's about the concept of Original Sin, but then how do you explain Ralph, Piggy, and Simon, all of whom are good guys. If anything, my favorite interpretation is that its about the potential for evil in all human beings and that only when we don't acknowledge it then we descend into savagery. Notice the fact that Simon sought to express human beings' inherent flaw, yet was laughed at for suggesting that the beast was inside them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a harshly realistic adventure about a group of boys who are stranded on a secluded island. These boys are alone, with no adults and no rules. So it is up to them to survive. The boys separate into groups, and the fight for dominance begins.I didn't think that a scary adventure story would frighten me, however, the details in Lord of the Flies are gruesome and horrible. The outcome of this story is savage and upsetting, however, it is also mesmerizing and I recommend it to anyone who is bored with whatever they're reading now."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read the book Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, and I thought that the main character Ralph was a very interesting character.When the boys landed on the island because their plane crashed, all of the boys came together to form a group. And Ralph really wanted to be the leader of the group. This was the motives that he had to make a result from. And he would not stop until he had reached his goal. He had to be the leader of the group to settle down.In the book, the kids kind of go crazy, because there isn't much food or anything like that, and everybody wants to be the leader, which makes Ralph's job a lot harder. The one thing he has to do to become the leader of the group, is to help everyone settle down and tell them what they have to do to survive all alone. He will do this to prove that he is trustworthy enough to be the leader.Towards the middle of the book and through the end, Ralph does become the main leader, because he starts making rules to follow. But everyone is still telling each other what to do, making his goal kind of half-come true.This is what I think Ralph's goals were and what he did to solve them and have a good result!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys (pre-teens and younger) who become stranded on an island with no adult supervision. Ralph is appointed their leader, but another boy, Jack, feels he is better suited to the position and ends up rebelling. The boys are plagued by \\"beasties\\" and \\"serpents,\\" but in the end, as they are driven to murder and betrayal, they realize that the only beasts on the island were in themselves.Whether or not you look at this novel as a fable, a myth (as Golding preferred to call it), or a simple \\"what if?\\" story, I think it is very good. The novel itself is fairly simple, but it leaves much to be discussed and/or mulled over. Many people think that the ending is \\"cheap\\" or \\"gimmicky,\\" but I think that it was the only ending that could have worked so effectively.Anyway, I recommend this to anyone, whether or not you need a book for class or for leisure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What would you do trapped on an island with no adult supervision and no way out?

William Golding starts off the intriguing novel with a devastating plane crash lands a group of young boys onto a deserted island. This beautifully written provocative adventure proceeds as the boys struggle in daily battles against nature and man. Throughout the novel the main characters Ralph, Jack whom are the eldest, and Piggy a younger member of the clan, work together and against one another to survive this untimely circumstance they have ended up in.

These young boys are shown things that many of us have never seen and that we will never see. They escaped Europe because of a war and their plane crashed so they ended up on an island, no one knowing who or where they were. The boys are afraid of a \\"monster\\" but in the many reflections of symbolism in this book, they are the monster. They boys start out being civilized and end out becoming savages. The idea of an utopian society is seen throughout the book. The boys first believe that the world will be great, a world without parents, adults or teachers to scold. They thought that the world would be so much better on the island. It shows that the utopian society does not work and will eventually become corrupted.The end of the book takes an interesting turn and will suprise everyone who has ever read it. It is defidently a book to read for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies is a book about how we really get to take a closer look at peoples interactions with each other. Golding writes of a group of boys who were stranded on an unknown island and how the boys work differently on how to survive. Their human nature and true personalities are exposed after spending some time on the island. The boys break off into two different groups for the remainder of their story. The leaders of the groups were Jack and Ralph. Their groups were also known as the \\"bounty hunters\\" for Jacks group and \\"fire inhibited\\" for Ralph's group. Jack's group is thought to just want to kill and eat and then they repeat. Ralph's group wants to keep a fire going so hopefully someone near might spot them.The Lord of the Flies is an excellent example of how we might actually act when the rules of society are taken away. I think this particular book is a pessimistic novel. Even though Ralph's hope of survial brings assurance and optimism, Jack's group discourages our hopeful thoughts when they become like savages. Jack's inhumane acts exudes at its highest when it is pure darkness and all he could think about was killing the pig. The story turns when Simon got in the middle of the savages but the boys thought Jack was the pig and forced themselves upon him until his flesh had met their mouths. They decided he wasn't palatable and they just left him lying there to rot. In certain situations, especially when it depends on your survival or life to death, your true self becomes more visible.I enjoyed reading this book even though it seemed pessimistic. I thought it was interesting to look at how some might act expecially in closed-in situations which Lord of the Flies provided. Lord of the Flies definity helped broaden my thoughts and horizons on how to look at certain situations or why a person might act a certain way. It was easy to read and I recommend it for teenagers to read. I would rate the book a four out of five so it was definitely worth the time of sitting down and reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is really good especially since at my age you can relate to some of the characters. Everyone knows a Ralph or Jack in their life. What I liked about his book is how Golding can make the island a symbol of how the world is. Also he makes symbols of all these important things so once you actually read it carefully you get the real meaning of the book which is how mankind is actually is. What I didnt like about the book was that it only had boys. It seems like if males can only survive or if they're more better than females. I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older but mainly to high school age students since this is a book that makes you relate to all the characters in the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was described to be a \\"good\\" or \\"like new\\" condition (I don't remember which now) paperback of a classic book in a more recent edition.

There appears to be only one boy with any real sense in this novel and he is called \\"Piggy \\" and his wisdom is dismissed by the other boys for the sole reasonthat he is overweight and son becomes a figure of fun to the other boys.For once an author has written about childhood without seeing it through \\"rose tinted glasses\\".

As everyone must know, the book depicts a group of schoolboys marooned on a tropical island, where in the absence of an overbearing state they soon fall into the \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" existence predicted by Thomas Hobbes and many other political philosophers.This is a wonderful premise for a novel, but Golding's treatment of it is pedestrian and there is little here that is surprising or entertaining. On the first page, we meet a fat boy with glasses. He's obviously doomed. On the fourth page, we read that another boy has \\"a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil.\\" So we know he's not going to be at the top of the food chain, either. And so on.Admittedly, part of the problem may be that the book has been so widely read and discussed. Supposing that this book may have more to offer someone who is not already familiar with its theme, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and three stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is among some of the best I have ever read! Along with being such an awesome book, this novel teaches an important lesson. Have you ever wondered what would happen if there were no adults around? Well, this book is sort of an example of what can happen. When there are no adults and no laws around, kids of all ages can start to act 'aggresive'. Starting gangs, and over all doing things kids would not do when adults are around. So, over all this novel not only teaches us but 'shows' us what happens in a care-free lifestyle with no laws and adults. Ok, now back to the book. Ralph, (the main character) finds himself and others plane-wrecked. After meeting some of the other plane-wrecked boys, everyone finds out that there is no adults. Most people go and are not very active about helping eachother. Instead most kids are interested in food, fun and themselves. Only about one kid, Piggy, cares about their lives and safety. This is why, this novel can prove that, like it or not, their is only so many people that actually care about the safety of themselves and others.

Bought the book for my kid who needed it for for a school assignment. Quality control is unacceptable."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's idea was brilliant. He delved into the true, hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book, a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules, goals, and a leader. Of course, this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared, goals are forgotten, and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.The idea is well thought out and interesting. However, Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end, when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.If you want an examination of human nature, then read this book.If you want an adventure story, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book doesn't deserve a review. With all due respect, Golding couldn't write a good book to save his life. His writing is reminiscent of Tolkien's; he comes up with a great story, and then ruins it with horrible writing. But I suppose I should stop ranting about the book and get on to a summary.A relatively large group of young boys are marooned on an island. One young boy, Ralph, decides he's the leader because has in his possession a conch shell, which most SpongeBob fans will recognize from one of the episodes. In his \\"Inner Circle,\\" there are some other boys: Piggy, an unpleasantly fat asthmatic intellectual; Samaneric, two twins who individually are Sam and Eric, and the \\"littleuns,\\" some of the youngest boys who can't get it through their thick skulls that they're lost on a deserted island. Ralph is encountering problems with Jack, the leader of the boy's choir, who has a rebellious soul. Without spoiling too much of the story, Jack gets mad, runs off with most of the boys, and several other events that fail to stimulate the brain. In the end, they are all rescued by the Royal Navy, (they're British,) and they all live happily ever after, minus a pudgy pain-in-the-rear. If you ask me, I would have been a bit more pleased if they all died.This summary may sound choppy and rushed, because the book is choppy and rushed. The author had several chances to redeem himself, but why only put the book's namesake in a one-and-a-half page segment of the book that has no symbolism, real or otherwise. When you look back at the story, you may think, \\"Wow, that sounds really cool!\\" And the story is, but it makes no sense, and the parts that do are just plain dull. In the hands of a good author, namely Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and especially Orson Scott Card, this book may have been one of my all time favorites. Goodkind and Card would have turned the book into an action-packed book with beautiful internal conflicts, and Jordan would describe the island with such vivid detail I would feel like I wanted to get lost on an island myself. However, as it is, I'm now terminally afraid of anything surrounded by water on all sides.The point I'm trying to get around here is this: Great story, God-awful writing. I'd only give this book a one out of ten, the one only for story. In a videogame, even if the game isn't too pretty, if it has a great core, it's a wonderful experience. With books, however, that's just not true."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I might just be a teen in high school but I know what I like and this book was not one in my interest. Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own.

The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it!

I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written, because it has real personalities as real people. For example, when people are in a group they change to fit in, just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was &quot;less than perfect&quot; because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either.

It just takes a lot to bring it out, some more than others. I do agree with the author, I believe that there is a little violence in everyone also. Out of all the literary elements, I think the author handled characterization the best. He made every character symbolize something. He even gave them names that had literal meanings, which were actually what each character stood for. Golding shows excellent characterization skills, in this classic. I think this book is believable. This can easily happen, and probably has happened in real life. I don't know if the level of violence would be so extreme. It is hard to tell because I have never witnessed a situation, in which somebody would have so much fear, that they would become that violent. If I could, I wouldn't change the book much at all. Maybe I would change the ending a little bit, in the sense of who died, and who didn't. I would've probably added some more characters also. One more thing I would've done is create a game, or form of entertainment that the boys invented, and frequently enjoyed on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies Golding is trying to show how evil comes out of people when they fear the unknown.

I think this book was pretty good and i would encourage you to read this book if you like adventure and want to learn new things."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked the book because of the action and how I saw the different characteristics of each character. The type of person that I think that would like the book the most is the adventurous type.I think the purpose for writing the book was to show that without authority, there would be total chaos. I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different. I would fix these flaws by continuing until the action is over. All in all this book was an ok book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was really great and I would suggest to my friends to read this book. At first I didn't like it but when everything started happening I really started to enjoy the book. My teacher also made the book very fun to read becasue she put alot of energy into it. The more energy you use to read the book the better it is. The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of Ralph,Piggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society today,and made me think what if something like that could happen, what would it be like. Trust me if you read this book you will be very impressed. One Love and Peace Out!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding is writing this book so he can send out a message. The message is there is evil inside everyone. I do not agree with this message because Simon was pure good. The literary element I think he used best is symbolism because he used it alot. I think this book is very believable because there is evil in some boys, and those boys will do crazy things. There is only one thing I don't like about this book. I think Jack or Roger should of die or really get hurt."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone. I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is &quot;good&quot;. I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Other reviewers have been harsh on this novel in general; in my view it was an intriguing look into the unfolding of society among a group of marooned boys while at the same time remaining an exciting adventure story. Golding's illustrative style fit the plot well, and his statement about war, evil, and the human psyche is clear. Add this one to your repertoire if you know what's good for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"People are can do the most horrible deeds. History is littered with the refuge of human's greed, lust for power, and blood. From Caligula to Richard the Lionheart's slaughter of Muslims to the Vikings to the Nazis and the holocaust to Rwanda to Jonesboro, man is capable of the worst. Civilization is thin and fragile. This book shows the extreme of society erased and humans unleashed. But this isn't pessimism, just realism. How many of the kids try to create a good society? Doesn't the example of Simon (an obvious Christ figure) show hope? When the bad and lawless or the tyrants threaten a good society, doesn't that society take up arms and war against? Like the allies against Nazi Germany? The truth is even kids are capable of murdering viciously, recent national headlines prove that, but these kids like everybody are capabale of love and civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When we are young, we are unstable. We are like you protoplasm. Very unstable and full of energy. To stabilize there has to be something there keeping you stable. This is where your parents come into affect. Your parents are the glue that keeps you in order and provides that barrier that keeps you in line. But in the book, Lord of the Flies, that barrier is removed leaving fragile children to fend for themselves and provide order. Something of which children have no knowledge what so ever. In his book Lord of the Flies, William Golding seems to captivate anarchy among a small collection of children. But also a feeling of gradual decesent into insanity. A feeling that of which belongs in the twilight zone. Along with his use of symbols to try to bring order to the book. If you look deeper this book is a metaphor for the monarchy of England. Where one group (the weaker one with Paul as their leader)is weaker but its led by the true leader is representative of the people of England and the leader is the Queen. The other group is representative of parliament, a stronger group with a leader who is really listened to. But you might see it differently depending on your situation. Even though, the main theme stays the same. Without order there is only death and madness."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I must say, the book was very well written, but the plot was totally unrealistic. After being on the island for only about a year (assuming that is how long, with the change of seasons) these proper British boys turn into bloodthirsty savages. I understand them doing stuff they would not normally be allowed to do, but to murder someone the way Roger did? I strongly believe something like that would never happen in real life."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has it all: sympathetic characters, a great plot, frightening and powerful symbolism, and a good lesson on mob rule. Perhaps this book may even be powerful enough to stop our world's next violence-caused calamity."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm very surprised to see such negative comments about this book. Its one of the best.. if not the best books i have ever read. The symbolism in this book is so powerful. Maybe if you just opened your eyes and payed attention you could see that. This book was brilliant."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a book with good ideas, lots of symbolism...the struggle between order and recklessness. The problem lies with the deeper meanings revealed in the book. There are just to many of them..therefore it is really easy to get things confused. The way the author describes the characters is lacking information. For example, why is the boy Jack who only wants to hunt...so jealous of Ralph who only wants to get home, there must be more him that would justify his actions. The description of the &quot;BEAST&quot; is very hard to understand...was there one or not? Some parts of the plot, (it was so hard to see where everything was going) were long and irrelevant to the story, such as the long, dragged out descriptions of the island itself. The ending is the worst part about it...it ended so abruptly one minute there is a man hunt and suddenly there are the rescuers. If you want to think alot about a book ...then this is the one for you. As for those who must read it for school...I suggest getting it from the library than actually buying a copy at the bookstore. I am sorry I purchased the thing myself...I guess that's what I get for listening to a friend telling me to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is very interesting, but also horrific. It reflects the society today of many things spinning out of control, this is a really good book, which is talking about how humans would behave when there is no government or law."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have read William Golding's book Lord of the Flies. The book is about a group of boys who try to survive on a isolated island after a plane-crash. It is interesting so see the relationships between the boys, how they immediately take up different positions. At their fist meeting one boy, Jack, is chosen as the leader. Rules are made and accepted by every one. In the beginning everything was organized. Young and old boys are working together and everything is fine. But then their friendship begins to fail. One boy who they call Piggy becomes the outsider. Another boy who's name is Jack, who from the beginning also wanted to be the leader, starts to take over more and more. One day the group splits up and Jack forms his own group with completely different rules. Nothing is working on the island anymore and it runs out of control. One night something terrible happens, and it's then when Ralph understands that it's only the beginning. The rules which they all decided from the beginning don't exist any longer. Then Ralph becomes alone, against everyone else...I thought the book was kind of good, but not as good as I had expected it to be, because it's so popular. It is written with describing sentences that makes it easy to imagine the environment and how they think. The language is easy to understand, since the author writes as the children think. But yet the text is deep and the book made me think. The subject that Golding has chosen is unusual, but good. It doesn't only tell us about the boys on the island, but wants to show that power isn't only a positive thing and can lead to something else, much worse.From Karin, 15 years"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's perception of the kids' innate evil to most people was obsurd, but no one knows and that's what he thought. He uses descriptive writing, and it starts normal until the boys degenerate into savages and become evil. Golding also uses lots of irony."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that the book lord of the flies was a unique and realistic portrayal of human nature. I thought that the way the boys adopted to their surroundings was phenomenal. If i could symbolize this book in one line i would say that when it comes down to it every living organism on earth is interested in one thing and one thing only, its own survival.I thought that a little bit of it may have been extreme with the killing of eachother and everything but i think that being on that island long enough might have driven people to do things like that.One thing that i realized in the book was that you never actually find out where the island that they are on is located. My theory to why you never actually get to see this information is because William Golding was actually trying not to pay to much attention to detail because this story was about something as general as human nature.I think that the contrast and conflict between the characters is so intriguing and the transformation of these characters throughout the story from nice english boys to nasty savages is completely fascinating.I think another theme that i can derive from this book is survival of the fittest. This is Darwins theory at its best it is the show survivor but with no cameras and real danger. Instead of getting voted off you really die.I also think that even though it seems like a lot of the boys are against eachother that they could not have survived without eachother. Even though it seems like Jack was made for this stuff if he was put there alone instead of being almost excited about being a leader he would be in a state of panic and i dont think he would last too long.Overall i thought that this book was very intriguing and it is a good look at what is going on in the brain of a man who knows a huga amoung about human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked in Lord of the Flies by William Golding how the kids disagree about how to survive on the island. I liked both Ralph's and Jack's opposing personalities. I believe if this situation were to actually happen, kids could act this way. William Golding's book is believable.The theme of Lord of the Flies is decision-making affects your future. Ralph's conservative, hard work ethic is a good philosophy if getting off the island is the goal. Yet Jack is a liberal, spontaneous soul with no other goal than to have a fun time on the island. At times I have to make vital decisions just like the older boys. On one hand they can decide to build a fire for smoke to signal to ships passing by and also make huts for shelter. Or they could spend their time hunting, feasting, having fun and hoping for a ship to fortuitously come rescue them. William Golding makes the story believable by revealing all the younger boys and most of the older boys to be impulsive. I feel that real boys probably would behave the same way in this situation. When all the \\"biguns\\" except Ralph and Piggy decide to hunt instead of make huts, it isn't what I would do. But many of the boys I've known would take Jack's philosophy. I have seen people take foolish risks and I have seen people not take enough risks. Some of the former have lost the desire to do well in sports in which they had great potential. While the latter have lost friends from isolating themselves.The book is average until about two-thirds of the way in. There was one part of the book that hooked and reeled me in when Jack confronts Ralph's leadership ability. The one line that made the book great in my eyes is on page 127 when Jack angrily asks, \\"Who thinks Ralph oughtn't to be chief?\\" This line sets up the way the book plays out and it got me really thinking about what was going to happen next. I would highly recommend this book to others because in the beginning it just seems like an average book and then it gets exciting, worrisome and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like most people, I had to read this in school. For me it was highschool. I didn't like it very much then but I've sinced realized why that is. I like thinking about the books I read but I don't want to write three essays on a part of it I don't care about. I'm sure many of you agree with me.Anyways, this book is thought provoking. I've seen the movie too and they are both good.It makes you wonder what life was like many years ago and how we have evolved. (NOTE: This has nothing to do with creation vs. evolution, even if you believe we were created, we have still evolved since we were first put on this earth.) It's about savages and human nature.A similar book that I would recommended for older teens and adults would be Second Nature by Alice Hoffman."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is an amazing story of a journey that goes awry, and of the growing menace that confronts those who survive--a menace from within as well as without. What begins in a spirit of cooperation turns dark as betrayal and temptation overtake our little protagonists. The diminutive leader and his chubby sidekick are good-hearted but unsure that they are fit for this quest, and encounter those who would rather ignore their responsibilities and enjoy life while they can. The wilderness that the Fellowship must confront is hazardous enough, but envy and spite gnaw away at the heart of one who travels with them, who would take the Ring for himself. This was J. R. R. Golding's first novel, and undoubtedly his finest."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one of the greastest books that deals with getting stranded on an island!

Then out of nowhere they...actually i would rather just have you read the book for yourselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, the author William Golding shows the reader what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island. This great book was written in 1954. Lord of the Flies is a fiction, adventure, novel.William Golding writes about how the kids on the island face their fears in order to survive. Golding does a great job of painting a visual picture with his detailed descriptions. He describes the emotions and challenges that each individual character is having. William Golding makes Lord of the Flies sound so real that you don&#65533;t know if the two worlds, the fiction and ours are any different from each other. He describes his book so well that the fearful life the kids have might just scare you too.I would recommend this book for anyone especially people who like descriptive, puzzling, nightmarish books. I would give this book a 9 out of 10 on the rating scale. In summary, the book had lots of details, a splendid plot, and a very unexpected ending."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies portrays the wicked, sinful nature of man. In the beggining of the tale the boys are proper and organized. As it progresses however, the boys become blood thirsty murderers. Ralph is the leader of the civilized tribe but later loses control to Jack. Jack's tribe hunts for food and has a fort, while Ralph tries to keep a smoke signal alive. Jack's tribe kills two of Ralph's friends and plans to kill Ralph...This book shows the evil nature of man and how it can easily get out of control."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you have ever read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell,then you will enjoy &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a book that demonstrates how society deals with war, and also serves as a warning bell to society to show people what could happen if they don't react more civilized in a time of crisis. Golding symbolized this situation with children stranded on an island forced to live by themselves and under their own rules. This is a great book if like political/war novels or if like Goerge Orwell since both authors deal with the same topics."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is probably the best book I've ever read. Golding managed to stir feelings no other writer I've read ever has. It is definitely not a fluffy happy book, but deeply dark and disturbing. I shiver at the thought of the savagery that humans, that little boys, can come to without rule and order. Especially, the part they were beating up a fellow friend on the beach...... urgh...stomach churning stuff. Really amazing writing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written. The slow process from civilization to savagery is perfectly structured. The tale of 30-or-so boys on an island, struggling to survive, is a comparison to modern society, some wishing to find food and fight, others wanting to take things one step at a time.This novel is dark, horrific, and ingenious."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A LOT MORE THAN JUST A GREAT SURVIVAL STORY...IT DEALS WITH POWER STRUGGLES, GROUPS, AND CAN RELATE A LOT TO THE SURVIVOR SHOW! (BUT MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The closest comparison to The Lord of the Flies is probably Animal Farm. I think the Lord of the Flies is better then Animal Farm (also a classic) because the lord of the Flies can be an Allegory to several different things. Among them are: What people behave like in groups, how childred act without proper supervision, how people act in desperate situations etc. It could be studied in a Sociology class just as easily as in an English class.A real eye opener"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really don't get how people can say that this is the worst book that they have ever read? At first I was completetly lost because I had no idea about anything about the book, but once I got the idea of it I was thoroughly interested. It portrays a side of human nature that I never thought of, but now can stop thinking of. I beieve that this may happen if the right opportunity were presented and the right people involved, yet I think that the chance would be one in a million. The quote that really awed me was &quot;...a stick sharped at both ends...&quot; At first I was bewildered to think what it could mean, but once I realized I was both horrified and intriuged by it. It was an interesting, yet somewhat grotsque book that anyone who likes unusual books and adventure would enjoy... GO SOUTH LYON LIONS!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I don't know how somebody could live with themselves if they believe the message of this book. Lord of the Flies is brilliantly written and chocked full of symbolism. Hell, its probably really worth reading too, but certianly not for entertainment. Goldings ultimate message at the end of the book is that the human race is hopeless and detructive and that civilazation means nothing and thats simply not true. mabye i'm a wimp but i like to read uplifting things that make you feel good. Dickens for example. Anyway, the books are depressing especially if you like to look for the good in people. I couldn't decide weather this deserved 1 or 5 stars so i gave it three."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I could go into the deep underlying messages that are contained in this wonderful novel by Golding but that would ruin it for you, the next reader. This book is by far one of the best books i have ever read. The easy to understand writing made what was going on to these castaways all too clear to miss. But at the same time their fate was intricatly layed in front of me and compeling and made me stop and think, &quot;maybe it could happen that way if...&quot; . Ralph's attempt to make sense of the situation and Piggy's need for structure in order to survive were both brutally beaten down by the harsh reality of the situation that Jack embraced. If there were ever a novel written for Darwin's theory this would be it. children lose touch with civilization and do what they think they must to survive. all around one book that i suggest to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I personally disliked the book except for a few parts. I also do not see any significance from the title to the book. There is only one scene mentioning the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and I dont get it.

They get the impression that Golding was condoning violence. It shows how short sighted peaple are .What he did instead was show how a civilization can decay , from within . First 1 part of the society is isolated from the rest then that part of society gets violent.Of coarse theres other ways of interpertating this book . But they all come to almost the same conclusion , that people have a violent nature. Realy this book should be read in colleges rather then high schools. When the teachers often misunderstand the depth of this novel how can they explain the symbolism to the students."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book by Golding is a wonderful.I think his purpose for writing this book is to show how horrible and out of control the kids would be on the island with out any adults. I also think he did an excellent job describing each character and giving them their own ways of doing things. This book beleivable because I know if you leave a bunch of children on an island alone, sooner or later they will show their true colors.

Most of te time if you have a bad attitude about something you won't enjoy what you are doing. When you read this book go further into the book. Don't just look at it like they crash landed on an island and they are stuck untill they are found. The book has hidden meanings. You must look at it in a religious content.

This is the book that seriously got me to believe that reading is not a waste of time and effort. It was absolutely amazing and it connected with the primal instincts of man and corruption. The concept of it appealed to me as an eighth grader, a friend described it as...&quot;a group of boys are on an island, they form groups and start killing each other...&quot; As far as I was concerned, this was better than Anna Karenina or all that other Literature stuff they make you read. Two years later, I picked it up again. Older and more understanding, I understood the concept Golding was trying to convey. It is amazing. It bares the instinct and nature of man in a vivid harsh way. This was the first book I read without Cliffs Notes and I truly appreciated it.

It does not only shows how each boy (of varying ages) responds to his predicament, but also deals with man's nature & the society through symbolisms.It is inate in us to differentiate good & evil, & this characteristic is further strengthened by the society's norms. Ralph represents our logical side which is continuously governed by reason (\\"Piggy\\"). Both Ralph & Piggy embody our continuous search for civilization & order. However, also inate in us, is a brewing desire to do what we really want, no matter how unjustly or incorrect it is. Jack portrays this aggressive behavior.In an ideal environment, it is common for men to have desires but these can only be manifested & carried it out if they comply with society's set rules. However, this is not the usual case. The catastrophe faced by the boys only magnifies society's imperfections. These ills cannot be easily cured on a superficial level. The success or breakdown in society can all be traced to man's inner stability."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have read this book 4 times, and it gets more and more excting each time i read it.

A group of young boys crash on an island, and one thing becomes clear immediately: only one can be the leader. I think this competition between two factions is accurate and exciting. The struggle becomes so fierce towards the end of the book, it got my adrenaline flowing just reading it. I don't think the book has to constantly be interpretted as 'democracy vs. anarchy' or in terms of decent society vs. brutal savagery. The book can be simpler than that if you, as the reader, want it to be. Just a note: I think the most important character was Simon.

When they are put on the island after a plane crash. At first they follow reason make a signal fire collect food make shelter so that if there is a storm they will have somewhere to go. The two main powers are Ralph and jack. Ralph seems to the others to be a constricting adult. He pressures them to work and collect fruit tend to the fire instead of running around and playing games on the beach or hunting pigs to eat. Jack is the solution to this he offers a separate tribe to join instead. They paint their faces hide in wait of pigs and develop strategies to track them down. Eventually tempted by the new power most of the boys move over to jacks tribe because they are sick of work and want meat instead of fruit to eat. When there are only a few left with Ralph. Ralph and piggy try to confront the lack of interest in getting rescued also piggy needs his glasses back. There is a scene where piggy gets a rock dropped on him and Ralph fights with jack. As a spear glances off his side Ralph turns and runs to hide in a thick thorn bush the next day when they hunt him. His friends who were forced into the other tribe betray him and before he can be smoked out, he breaks their ranks. Later he hides under another bush in a shadow but Rodger finds him. As they chase Ralph shelters are bursting into flame.The ending leaves you hanging you don't really know what is going to happen I didn't really like that though you do get to just make it up yourself. They kill each other. Piggy Simon and one other a boy with a mark on his face goes missing early on. As soon as the navel officer is on the beach they just stop forget that they are all savages or perhaps they remember that killing is wrong and they should have been organized. With the words&quot; what have you been doing?&quot; they all change. Also the torture of am and Eric with spears into joining the tribe and leaving Ralph by himself.The whole book Ralph and Jack are fighting each other this seems to be more of the storyline then the obvious one of boys being stuck on an island and what they do. It Seems that its the fight between their morals and hope on being rescued. Ralph gets his hope from piggy and Jack to help ease the pain of never being rescued starts the tribe of hunters. Then he can take out his pain on tracking the pigs and learning the art of hunting.Lastly Simon talking to a pigs head is just plain weird and i can understand why they take it out of the book for the movie except that this is the only reason that the book is called lord of the flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's Lord of the Flies is a great book. It's a story about British kids who crash onto an island with no adults and form their own civilization. I thought this book was a little slow at first, but the end is very exciting and also perhaps a little creepy.This book is also great on a much deeper level beyond the basic story. It is full of symbolism and it has been said to be many things, such as allegories on things as varied as Christianity to Psychology. On the basic level this book shows the conflict between mankind's civilization and his naturally savage nature that is hidden deep inside all of us.This book is still very good, even if you don't care about symbolism!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book was short and an easy read filled with symbolism..for those who dont really care about symbolism this is a great story about kids stuck on an island who start to kill each other. Unlike other classics like the scarlet letter which was a disgrace to literature.. lord of the flies is worth the read. It's near impossible to put down and does not go on endlessly for no reason, nor does it take forever to get to the point."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Again another book tagged as an \\"enduring classic\\" is, to be blunt, a disspointment, and at many times a horrible bore. I myself do not really appreciate the writing stlye of Golding. It seemed to me all of his quotes ended like this-- This was very frustrating to read, giving me the feeling more was to be said, but was never written, often bringing me off track while i was reading trying to wonder what the character was trying to say and i would realize i had read a page or 2 and had not the slightest clue of what i read. Another problem that i found within this book was the sheer number of unimportant characters the continually are mentioned. Characters with no background or character development are often named, making me feel as though i missed something, again taking me off track of my reading. Overall the story itself has an interesting idea, in my opinion, this interesting story is quite frankly ruined by the poor quality of Golding's writing. A frustrating read, filled with obscure as well as obvious symbollism, I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Sometimes you just happen upon a book that just draws you in and becomes an important part of your bookshelf. This happened with Lord of the Flies. I'm normally one who steers away from literature in the 'classics' section at Borders, as it gives me memories of bad books that we've all been forced to read in high school (then again, maybe I'm just to young too appreciate The Awakening or Mainstreet... ) I just happened to randomly pick this book off the shelf and start reading while I was waiting for a friend to find something. By the time she came back, I was so engaged in the first chapter that I bought it. I enjoyed it...it's the type of book that you can ponder about afterwards and it's not a boring read (*cough*Lord of the Rings*cough*). In fact, I ALMOST enjoyed writing a paper about it senior year! If you'd like to read something unique, disturbing, and thought provoking, then this something you should read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this novel some years ago in junior high, and it remains one of the few to which I continue to return and re-read. And each time it offers new meanings and insights. Part of its charm derives from the fact that it can be appreciated on so many different levels, however hackneyed it may be to suggest so. It can be read through and enjoyed as an adventure story, full of drama and suspense. But, of course, it is much, much more, and this is why it is such a wonderful piece of literature.Lord of the Flies is best known, probably, for its symbolism, and as one critic has opined, it is a symbolism that works. Each element, each symbol, operates individually, independently, but also interlocks with everything else in the book--not simply the other symbols but also the characters, the setting, the theme--from which it draws its deepest meaning. The conch, the platform, Piggy&#65533;s specs, the pig&#65533;s head, the island itself--they all fit beautifully and memorably together, along with Golding&#65533;s stunning descriptions of places, characters, and events, to create the picture of a society corrupted by flaws in its constitutive human beings. It richly deserves its reputation as a classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book opened my eyes to the wonderful world of classic literature. If my mind were erased and I could only keep one memory it would be the lessons taught by this book. Golding wrote a masterpiece. I was forced to read this book 2 years ago when I was in 10th grade. Being the highschool slacker that I was I kept to my sparknotes. One night I actually got the responsibilty to pick up the book and start reading it. I finished it that night, I could not put it down. I researched all the symbolism in that book. Now every essay I write I use Lord of the Flies. This book is incredible. I urge everyone to not only read it, but study it. This book is so powerful it turned a highschool slacker into a English major!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book, while trying to simulate a society of youths thrown together in unusual circumstances, is simply too far-fetched to work. the psychological component would not be present without a string of huge coincidences that cannot be taken seriously (im talking about the parachuter on the top of the mountain, among others). i continually found myself comparing lotf to animal farm by george orwell, another &quot;simulated society&quot; novel. the latter is by far more convincing, even if its main characters are nothing but common barnyard animals."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, takes place on an island with no adult supervision. Stuck on this island is a group of boys; most of them turn to hunting and killing (This group is led by Jack Merridew), and the two others (named Piggy and Ralph) stick to rules and trying to be rescued. Essentially, this quote: \\"Which is better- to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" (164) covers the theme of this book. I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, the ending and theme of this book leave the reader thinking. On the other hand, the majority of the book is not very exciting.The theme and ending of the Lord of the Flies were what kept my interest. The quote: \\"Which is better- to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" is one that cannot be answered easily. It was very interesting how the boys dealt with the question, and how most of them leaned toward the hunting and killing aspect of survival.However, despite the fact that the idea of the book is interesting, it is very slow moving. There is a lot of description of events, which makes the book uninteresting. One example is when they are describing what will happen with the fire which they keep going to catch the eye of a ship that could rescue them. There is a lot of dialogue and description that could be done without. For example, when Piggy and Ralph find out that Jack let the fire go out, there are two pages of description of their reaction.Some of the characters are also underdeveloped. One character, Simon, plays an important role in the book, yet he only appears a few times. He is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies. Still, he is barely described, and the reader does not get a good enough sense of his personality. This lack of description also makes the reader care less about these characters, so, the scenes that they're in seem less important. I even had to re-read the part about the Lord of the Flies, because since I didn't think Simon was very important, I didn't pay too much attention to that scene.Additionally, the book skips around. Simon, for example, leaves the group to search for the beast (which is the Lord of the Flies). It goes back and forth between Simon and the Lord of the Flies interacting, and the rest of the boys discussing what to do with the conch. This takes emphasis off of this important part, and it is also confusing. I had to re-read a few parts.The end of the book was sort of worth wile. It was simply a nice ending, and nice is exactly the word that explains it; it wasn't exciting, happy, sad, etc., just plain nice. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy symbolism, detail, and adventure stories. I would not recommend this to someone who is looking for some leisure reading. It is fairly complicated, and un-exciting. I chose to read this book because I heard that it was an outstanding classic. However, after reading it, I have found otherwise."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i thought this book was [bad]. at first but then I loved it. the plot starts off slow but then get very deep. this book is great it causes you to ask yourself what would I do. a quicker beginning would of helped the book a lot"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was absolutely awful until I reached the notes at the end of the book. I was bored by the lack of theme to the story and much of the visual descritpion was unnessecary. I was also confused by the absence of important information. Not until the end of the book did I realize that the story took place during World War II. Also, I could not decipher who the boys were and why they were all together yet did not know each other for some time. Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book. I would only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at the end. For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance was obvious. The notes told me that, and I understood the total point the author was trying to make more, but I was still disappointed that I could not have made the connections myself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has too much symbolism if you can't think deep enough. The book is mainly about human tendencies. It could be read on a political level, but that takes too much brain power. There is some killing and graphic violence. Above all, the book is one of the best books period."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i just completed reading the novel, Lord of the Flies. I am a 12th grade student at North Penn High School. At first i was bothered with the fact that i had to read the novel because i had so many other things i'd rather do, however after i did finally complete the book i saw a very interesting point behind it. this novel is a very true story about human civilization. it makes you really think about how people change because of society and also how people fall into other peoples traps by manipulation, just like Jack manipulated the boys. the book has a lot of symbolizm in it which can sometimes be hard to understand, but once the point is seen, the book is actually a good one. overall i dont think that this novel is all that bad. it is actually kind of interesting and i'm not so upset that i was forced to read it!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's, Golding,s purpose was to show the need for civilization. I agree with him because some of the boys died due to lack of rules and discipline. They needed civilization on the island. Also, I think that Golding handled the art of symbolizism best. The spactacles, the conch, and all of the other symbols made the novel a little bit entertaining. I think that the novel, Lord of the Flies, was believable because without rules and authority figures young teenagers will act in that manner, uncivilizied. There is nothing to my knowledge that Golding could have changed. I did not like it when Piggy died because he was my favorite character. I do know that without such an important event as Piggy's death the novel would not of had as strong of an efect on me."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A compelling adventure tale, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" succeeds in telling a story of the dark instincts inherent in the human condition. Although we are conditioned for a civilized society, Golding makes the compelling argument that if left to our own devices, we will revert back to our primitive roots, one where survival and savagery triumph over order and rules.Golding's tale could be described as an allegory of law vs. anarchy, and civilization vs. savagery. After a harrowing escape and crash landing on a deserted Pacific isle, a group of English boys, escaping a cataclysmic atomic war with the Communists, quickly organize into a rudimentary society, with Ralph as their elected leader. Ralph symbolizes the leadership and good of society. Piggy, the corpulent advisor to Ralph, represents the intellect and common sense in society. Jack, Ralph's nemesis, represents the corrupt power-mongers who use fear to rule their minions. Simon, an enigmatic but sensible boy, represents the kind and charitable in society, and proves a martyr in the end. And finally, Roger, sadistic and inhuman, symbolizes the pure evil that plagues society.As the boys descend further into savagery, their desire to be rescued becomes non-existent. Instead, they are content in their animalistic rituals, and become enamored of violence and adrenalin-fueled hunting expeditions. Their concern for others collapses, as Jack becomes the tyrannical leader of a rival tribe, and eventually all succumb to him. Although they arrived on the island as innocent victims of a horrific war, they lose their innocence on the island as evil creeps up from the recesses of their soul. Even if they were to return to society, they will never regain their innocence.Although Golding tells a moral tale, there is no shortage of action. From the chaos of the initial plane crash, to the fear of a \\"beast\\", to the final heart-pounding hunt of Ralph, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" delivers a chilling and exciting tale. I honestly cannot find any downside to this book. This is a superb read and is highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like many American High Schoolers, this novel was required reading along with various other books. Back then I thought it boring and depressing.Now every time I turn on the news or pick up a newspaper I see this novel in society today.Lord of the Flies is the tale of a group of english school boys stranded on an island much like the Swiss Family Robinson.Here they are, freed from petty western predjudices, religeon and oppressive government rules, left to their own natural nature which liberals tell us is Natural Goodness. One would expect they would readily take advantage of their situation to make themselves into a nice utopian comunity committed to the common good, ebrace and create a new world.They do anything but. Quickly they turn on each other. Quickly they fall apart as a group, reverting to the very worst. Indeed, the Voice of Reason is the end murdered.In an 'enlightened' liberal society which calls for 'Diversity' and 'Tolerance' and has outlawed caning and corperal punishment as means to enforce Order, tries to prevent criminals from being executed, makes morality a relative choice to the individual, Lord of the Flies is the world we live in today. From the Class clown who disrupts classes to the Bullies who stalk the Hallways of our Schools, soccer hooligans and after football riots, modern crudity at every level, the Criminals who contemptfully operate in a society whose penal system is eager to parole them back out but refuses to maintain order in its own ranks expecting utopia to come about from the mess it has made through its own 'elightened' stupidity, these are the those boys in real life.

The novel, while somewhat predictable and easy to understand, is filled with many important uses of symbolism. In the opening, Piggy finds a conch shell, and uses it to bring order to the group, and the conch shell continues to symbolize order throughout the novel. However, when Piggy is killed later on in the novel, the conch shell is destroyed also, symbolizing the end of order. The 'Lord of the Flies', a severed pig's head, symbolizes the cruelty and brutality that the members of Jack's group possess. Throughout the novel, there are many parallels that are made between the boy's civilization on the island, and civilization as a whole. This novel is easy to read right through and not fully understand its entire purpose, but I believe William Golding's purpose for this novel is to provide an understanding of the evils of civilization and government."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the FliesBy: William GoldingReviewed by D. WangP.5Lord of the Flies is a story about of boys who crash on a unhabited island. There are no adults to control the boys, and they are free to do as they please. Ralph emerges as a natural leader, and Piggy is the intellectual with a disdain for physical work. Jack, leader of a choir, is another boy who disputes Ralph's society and becomes leader of the hunters. Slowly, the other boys all join Jack. A conch is found early on and is used to restore order at assemblies, but soon Jack ignores it and all the rules the Ralph has. Jack tribe is also composed of the &quot;littluns&quot; who see a &quot;beast&quot;. Eventually, two will fall forever, and Jack's tribe will degenerate substantially, killing pigs and making offerings to the &quot;beast&quot;.William Golding described this book as attempt to trace the defects of society to the defects of individuals. This book relies heavily on symbolism, and whether likes or not depends on this point. I personally liked this book because of how it shows we degenerate. Jack and his tribe degenerate rapidly into savages. It is ironic when Jack says early in the book, &quot;We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything. So we've got to do the right things.&quot; Later in the book he is sitting on a log like an idol and finds unexplainable pleasure in torturing and killing a pig.The degeneration of the boys can be easily compared to the degeneration of society. As a race, humans have destroyed places, eliminated far more species than any known organism, and spend much time killing each other. Events such as the tortures and procedure of the Inquisition, the Holocaust, the dozens of wars and border skirmishes, and some cultures' entertainment. At times, killing is perfectly acceptable, even encouraged. The degeneration of the boys, at their young age (the oldest is twelve) is unsettling. Their change can be compared to our behavior and defects.My favorite part of the book is chapters three and four, the former being &quot;Huts On the Beach&quot; and the latter &quot;Painted Faces and Long Hair&quot;. You can see the boys reject society, playing and trying to hunt pigs instead of build shelters. In chapter four, a ship passes by, but Jack's tribe lets the fire go out because they are too preocupied with killing a pig. Jack's tribe starts the habit of their violent chant of &quot;Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood.&quot; Jack's savage side can be seen when &quot;He took a step, and able at last to hit someone, stuck his fist into Piggy's stomach.&quot; He continues, striking Piggy's head and breaking half of his spectacles. This book is an attempt to find our faults, and a grim reminder of what &quot;civilized&quot; people can do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I pretty much gave up on becoming a novelist after I read this book, just as I gave up on playing the guitar after listening to Eric Clapton.Golding's microcosm of humanity and its base nature is a far-flung island populated by refugee children.

The final chapter is as thrilling as anything I've ever seen on a movie screen.Largely thanks to \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" Golding won the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 1983.

Golding book was, in my thought, not well written. It was overly descriptive at some points, to the point where it lost your interest.

Some of the boys that are on the island are Ralph, Jack, Piggy, and Simon. Ralph is kind of the leader of the boys in the beginning. He is later left alone with piggy, a rotund boy whose glasses play a very important role in the book. Jack is one of the meanest boys on the island. He is the leader of the choirboys, which later become the hunters. He is the one who later takes control of the group and moves them to the other side of the island and attacks Jack and Piggy. Simon is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies. He also represents pureness among the boys. The book is about how a world without rules would only result in chaos and anarchy. At first the boys still acted civilized and respectful, but when the boys slowly broke away from the rules, their world descended into a world of madness. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book. You will never know what will happen next. I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to dive into a world without rules. It is a good source to show all of us just how important rules can be to us and that in order to maintain civilization; we must uphold these rules. This is a definite must read for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's first novel has rightly been regarded as a classic of modern literature since it was first published in 1954, in fact many consider this to be one of the finest novels of the last century if not ever. While it's certainly true that the greatest literature has a timelessness that lends itself to reinterpretation by subsequent generations, is this story of a group of boys who as Stephen King put it &quot;just went a little too far&quot; really in that category? In my opinion, absolutely.Set sometime in the near future during an unspecified world war, the story concerns the fate of a collection of boys stranded on a tropical island paradise after the plane evacuating them from the war zone crashes. All adults are dead and there is no way to make contact with the outside world. In short the boys are thrown back on to their own resources and forced to re-create the society that they knew. At first things go well &quot;after all we're not savages&quot;, but as tensions tear the group apart and fear and superstition reshape the boys world, we are confronted with the stark reality of just how fragile the structures of our own society which we have come to think of as indomitable actually are.Many feel that Golding was too pessimistic in his assessment that man is inherently bound to society and without day to day constraints imposed on us by the culture we live in we would more likely than not revert to nothing more than &quot;painted savages&quot;. But I feel that the power of the book derives from its fundamental truth, the darkness that dwells in the pit of the human heart is at times all to hideously evident and that's what makes \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" so brilliant and so frightening."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Having not been assigned to read this powerful and provocative work in high school or college, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, so to speak. Although short and compact in size, Lord of the Flies proves to be anything but that in breadth and depth. Nothing short of incredible, Golding's novella examines human nature and its internal and external variables that wield it into shape. An allegory no less, the pages of Lord of the Flies nonetheless come alive as they provocatively bring the reader into a paradoxical world of bestial Darwinian survival of the fittest versus rational deductional logic and care for one's fellow man.Unlike The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies asserts that human nature is inherently evil - not corrupted by external forces, but rather an intrinsic trait to be overcome. Our innocence is not lost by some terrible experience, because conversely we have never had it. While evil exists in all of us, Golding says, we must conquer it and make a decision based on logic and sound reasoning to consciously reject it, and, in turn, not revert to barbarous savagery. We, as individuals, must cognizantly and wisely choose the righteous, yet discerning path of Ralph, as opposed to the malevolent and malicious evil one of Jack, or for that matter, the indecisive and naive path of hapless Piggy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding wrote a masterpiece out of not very generousingredients, in the grand stile of British litterature.

How come to surpassthe sartrian 'Hell from the Others'? Do our un-disputableliberal 'civilised' principles hold against the oubreak ofinstincts and tribalism?

The police always gives you a ticket for even a minor accidental mistake yet they feed so many criminals who are convicted.

I am 26 years old now and still think about the morality and symbolism of human nature I discovered in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. I decided to write this review all these years later after watching the first installment of the TV show &quot;Survivior&quot;. I saw a lot of similarities. In &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; we are given a sort of scenario...what if a group of young adolescent boys were left abandoned on a deserted island. This is what happens...and as I describe some of the scenes from the book, compare them to that of a real life TV show a lot of us watch. Maybe like me, you'll see a more animal, evil side to these &quot;real-life&quot; strategy survival shows. On this deserted island a natural leader is born, Ralph. He is kind, and understanding of the fears his fellow students face. He accepts responsibility and delegates &quot;chores&quot; for the other boys to do. They must tend a rescue fire. They must hunt for food. They must tend to the wounded pilot. Ralph chooses the path a responsible adult might. Soon some of the boys become lazy. They do not follow Ralph's rules. These unruly boys are headed by another natural leader. The more &quot;wild&quot; and fun-seeking Jack. Jack and Ralph argue. To maintain control the boys find a large shell ....the conch....and whoever holds it has the right to speak. This attempt at order works for a little while but soon Jack dismisses the control the conch holds. He and his pig-hunting, lazy friends split from the original group and leave to another part of the island. They want to &quot;do their own thing&quot;. They defy rules and organization which Ralph feels is the key to survival. Meanwhiile Ralph and his friend Piggy struggle to keep their small group in order. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adult responsibility. For the youngest who fear Jack and his clan, Ralph becomes almost their savior, their security on an island of unknown. Soon Ralph's pack decides they too are tired of rules, and one by one leave to join Jack's ideas of senseless fun. Jack represents abandonment of control, living purely through pleasures. This is where you can form a million metaphors between the two clans of boys. Jack and his bandits become so wild and animal-like near the &quot;end&quot; that they actually start hunting Ralph in the manner of a real pig-hunt. They have forgotten society, basic humanity, and most of all..they have forgotten they were once all friends. This kind of behavior echoed alot of the back-stabbing things I see on TV and in the government, religion, everywhere in real life. Read this book and never let yourself abandon what you truly beleive to be good in your heart...Let us compare this book of instinct and leaders and followers to our own lives....On a personal note....Jack always kind of reminded me of Adolph Hitler and his control over his followers during the war. I would love to hear some other thoughts via e-mail. If you are reading this book for school, like I did once, really try to think about some real-life comparisons you find between the pages of Golding's work of art."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I also read this book in high school and saw the movie afterwards. I reread it recently since I remember enjoying it the first time. I was not disappointed this time either. The author spins an intriguing yarn about a group of boys deserted on an island during an supposed nuclear holocaust.

At first the overview that my teacher gave me, it sounded like it was a real interesting book, however once I got reading the book, I found that it was at all as interesting as it had sounded.Here is a little overview of the book; a group of British schoolboys survive a plane crash and end up on a desert island with no adults to watch over them. They soon create rules about how to run the group and who should be leader. They divide tasks among themselves and even use a conch shell to determine who has the right to speak to the group at large gatherings. They soon create their own society based on the values they have been taught. They manage to collect enough food and even to keep a fire going in the hope of being able to attract attention from would-be rescuers. Later on in the book, the order in their society starts to break down, as their situation becomes more desperate and as alliances between different subgroups start to build. The group begins to turn on each other; a war begins between two divided groups with two completely different leaders. Some boys begin to kill off the other boys in the divided groups. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure.The main characters of the book are,Ralph - The novel's protagonistJack - The novel's antagonistSimonPiggyRogerSam and EricThe Lord of the FliesI really did not like this book, when I was reading it; it seemed to be drawn out. Everything just to long to explain. At first it sounded like an interesting book, however when I got into reading it was not at all. It is just one of those books that I can not read with out falling asleep. It just didn't catch my attention form the beginning. There was nothing that interested me in the book at all. I found in many parts of the story, wondering what I had just read, I would have to reread that section over again, before I could understand what had happened. There were many sections of the book that I found myself confused. The scene of the book jumped from place to place making it hard to follow. Overall I just did not like the book at all, it just did not answer me from the beginning."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Kevin BradyLord of the Flies is a very enlightening book. It shows that with to much power people go crazy and do things so out of the ordinary. I enjoyed the book. Being a person who does not like to read, and is very picky about the books that I do read, this was a very good one.Due to the violence of a raging war, an airplane carrying a groups of English students is shot down. The boys of the plane find themselves to be stranded on an island. After they gather all of the boys on the island they start to make plans. Two of the oldest boys Ralph and Piggy find a conch shell, they decided to use it in order to summon the rest of the group. They Ralph as their leader, Ralph appoints another older boy Jack to be in charge of the choirboys who are in charge of hunting and getting food.The older boys set out and explore the island. They decide that they will light large torches to get the attention of passing ships. They gather wood easily, there is more than enough wood to have several fires. They use the glasses of piggy to focus the sunlight onto the wood and create fire. The problem is the boys were more focused on playing rather than monitoring the fire. The fire quickly gets out of control and burns a bunch of dead wood. The youngest of the boys disappears and they presume that he burned to death in the fire. The boys are very immature. They enjoy the loss of no adults and spend most of their time splashing and playing in the water. Ralph complains that nothing is getting done. They also fail in catching a pig, Jack the leader becomes more intent on catching a pig.An approaching ship passes by, but does not realize anyone is on the island because the rescue fire was out. Ralph rushes to the fire immediately only to find that Jack and the rest of the hunter's have caught their first pig. They gather around a fire and reenact the hunt. Ralph quickly blows the conch shell to call a meeting to restore order. At one of the meeting one of the \\"littluns\\" tells that he is haunted by the thought of a monster on the island. The older boys gather and tell each other to think logically and figure out where this monster would hide during the daytime. They come to some conclusion that he might live in the water.The boys that are responsible for watching the fire at night think they see a shadow of the beast, when they actually just saw the shadow of a dead parachutist, they rush back to the camp and tell everyone that they saw the beast. They organize a hunting party and go up the mountain, they see the shadow of the parachutist and run down the mountain. Jack criticizes Ralph of being a coward and says that he should be removed from power. The boys agree that they will never vote Ralph out of power. Jack runs down to the beach and tells all the hunter's to follow him. Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe. Simon falls upon the dead parachutist, and runs back to the beach to tell everyone. Before he can open his mouth he is trample and beaten to death. The boys saw the shadow of Simon and thought it was the beast and killed him.The next morning Jack's tribe of hunters attacks Ralph and Piggy. They steal Piggy's glasses and run back to their camp. Ralph and the boys from his tribe go to Jack's camp to try to reason with Jack. Jack order's that Sam and Eric be tied up, and one boy rolls a boulder down the mountain killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph hides for the night, but in the morning Jack sends out a search party looking for him. As his hunters try to track him down, Jack sets a forest fire trying to smoke Ralph out of his hiding spot. Ralph is forced to the beach, and collapses in exhaustion. When he wakes up there is a naval officer standing over him. Ralph weeps when he feels that he is safe, but thinks about everything that has happened. The other boys reach the beach and also start to sob. The naval officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Regarded as one of the great novels of the twentieth century and a staple of high school and college English Lit courses, William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is a gripping masterpiece, which gently glides the reader into the darkest depths of the human soul.It is rare to find a novel which is both beautifully written and a ripping good yarn, but this is both. Golding is a master craftsman of the language. His sentences and paragraphs are intricately designed; his metaphors evoke mood and mental imagery without stopping the flow of the narrative. And what a narrative it is, at that. Like Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, it is a compelling glance into the destructiveness at the heart of humanity as it devours and consumes the finer instincts, all cloaked in the guise of a pulpy adventure story. The characters manage to be both symbolic and complex.There are many novels you probably avoided reading in tenth grade English that are overrated, pretentious psychobabble. This is not one of them. It is a page-turner that will haunt you long after you reach the ending."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you haven't read it, you've heard of it and that's because the book is brilliant. It was chosen quite a few years ago to be included in the literary canon of most secondary schools, pushing its influence even further. William Golding presents a spectacular, terrifying view of humanity in this novel. A group of young boys, the only survivors of a plane crash, end up on a deserted island that has very few resources, but enough to survive. They begin their struggle to survive by thinking about rescue and democracy and capability, but it soon degenerates to rival factions, abuse, violence, and tribalism.Piggy, one of the main characters of the story, and Ralph's right-hand man never has an official name other than \\"Piggy\\". Typical of young boys, they find the weakest of the group and exploit and make fun of the individual. Piggy wears glasses, has asthma, and is overweight. He can do little to help work, but he is quite smart. Though Ralph tends to make fun of him just as much as some of the other boys, he seems to recognize that Piggy has a pretty good grasp of reality, putting him one step above the virtually useless \\"littluns\\". So since Ralph has nerve and Piggy has brains they become leaders. Piggy is more so in the background, whispering advice, while Ralph speaks up and demands. Unfortunately for Piggy, he is too shy and too scared of authority to do much else than be used.Simon, perhaps the most interesting character in the book, is perceptive, creative, intelligent and helpful. He adheres to a place of peace and rest: a garden of Eden inside the wilderness of the jungle that has grown on the island. He understands that the beast the children live in fear of is themselves. When he suffers from heat stroke and watches a pig's head transform before his eyes (Hell enters his garden) we might also discover that he suffers from more. He has a good head on his shoulders and is capable of higher level thought, even if he can't articulate it. He is the silent voice of reason. He is a martyr, facing the beast of the air and letting it loose, but the beast is still within the children and he knows it. All martyrs suffer, and Simon must do just that.There is a wonderful sense of hubris in Golding's work. There is this overarching thought process, other than Piggy and Simon who are the general outsiders, in the beginning of the book that everything will be just fine and that they, since they are English, can tackle any task and work it to their advantage. Advantages are gained, but at the price of what else? Can we really call them advantages?He also presents a great psychological presentation of what fear can do to children. Though, after reading the book several times, it is quite clear that this is not a child's condition, it is a human condition. Fear can foster creativity. The children quickly adapt to their surroundings and begin the process of regimenting jobs, building shelters, etc. Unfortunately, they lose sight of these goals rather quickly because darkness and imagination produce abominations, making fear smolder. Most of the time our fears are unfounded and are simply tricks of the imagination, but there is something very real on the island that these children, or humans, can and should fear: each other.Through the process of losing humanity the children get lost to themselves, becoming more and more tribal. The conch, a shell used to call meetings and to designate who speaks, is the representation of democracy. It, of course, loses its power as humanity begins to wane and disappear. A combination of fun and serious games turns to play that doesn't last long and fear that lasts much longer. They soon forget what fire can stand for other than a destructive force, bringing them further and further into the recesses of the tribal mind.Jack is the main reason there is a degeneration of democracy, order, and rationality. He is a very strong character, but his tenacity and leadership go horribly awry. He becomes leader of the hunting party, and though they are initially unsuccessful, he celebrates such destructive things as a a red badge of courage after a hunt. A small cut shows that he is tough and he becomes capable of hunting the pigs efficiently, while also making him bloodthirsty and vicious. His mental distancing becomes physical. He breaks away from Ralph. They break into factions and Jack's group centers around a more chaotic riot mentality instead of the rational mentality needed to survive other than the next ten minutes. Survival and butchery overcome the need to be rescued.Jack is, frankly, blown out of proportion and perhaps that is why Golding chose children instead of men. Men might feel more rational, but children are imaginative and deadly. Games can soon escalate to fights in a backyard, so why not something worse on a deserted island with no adults to break up the violence? Jack's irrationality is exemplified by the fact that he purposefully chases after and kills female pigs. Hunters don't, usually, hunt females because females are the backbone for keeping a population of a creature alive. By killing females it demonstrates that he is reckless and only wants to suit personal needs in the immediate future and not the long term. Golding was also aware that the killing of a female by a bunch of male hunters becomes a rape: sexual and primal. Jack is, in essence, killing the tenderness of a mother to make himself tougher.Ralph is not exempt from this mentality. He eventually, also, degenerates to survive. Though he keeps some rationality as he does so. Not wanting to give too much away for those of you who have not read it is key here so I will not say more.This books is not just a novel about survival but an in depth look at humanity. Just because the characters are children does not make it any less real to adults. It can be applied across the entire spectrum. We, as humans, are divided into factions, into communities. Some are seen as weak and timid, others are seen as aggressive and domineering. Unfortunately, in the grand scheme of life, there is no rescue for us. What would we do if we were trapped in these situations? How would we fight oppression? How would we balance our lives and keep sane?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didn't purchase this book for myself, but for my high school son.

The title is talking about boys who get stranded on an island and find a monster named the Lord of the Flies. The setting of the novel is on an island in 1954. The protagonist of the story, and my favorite character, was definitely Piggy. He was always trying to solve problems and be nice. The antagonist can be lot of different characters, but I think it was Jack. He was always trying to take control. I didn't like him. All of the characters were very believable and very interesting. This book is about boys who get trapped on an island. They try to work together and survive, but a beast roams the island they are on. The boys have to stop the beast, but even harder than that they have to try to work together. The rising action was when they found out the beast was real. The climax was when the boys started to fight.You found out about the boys in the story when they have their fist meeting. The writing described every little thing the boys did. The story is trying to be kind to one another is hard when also trying to run a town. The author is saying that you should not try to take control. You should let everyone have a say.

I'm fifty years of age, now, and it gets better with each reading. Mr. Golding's little book is not simply a story of young boys stranded on an island, but a complex allegory about males descent into primal urges and needs. The major characters, Ralph, Jack, Piggy and (somewhat) Simon, each represent certain aspects of the human condition. The story is brutal, spare in its prose and without a smidgen of humor. If you want to understand what is at the core of why people go to war or insist on seeing evil in others, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" spells it out for you in vivid horror. Simply one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A planeload of British schoolboys crashes on a desert island in the Pacific during the early part of World War II. No adults survive the crash and the boys settle in to \\"have some fun\\" and await rescue once their parents realize what's happened. Ralph, one of the older boys at around 13, is voted the leader of the group (which includes young children as well - \\"littluns\\" and \\"biguns\\"). Ralph is aided by a nearsighted and overweight boy callously nicknamed Piggy, who suggests he blow a conch shell to gather everyone together. Initially they all agree on some rules, and most help out, but there soon becomes a division in the group as another boy, Jack Merridew, challenges Ralph's rules.I was never assigned to read this in school and didn't really have much interest in it. All I'd heard was that it was a dark and disturbing tale, and something about the boys eating each other (they don't, though). But when my son was assigned it in school I thought I might read it, too, since he usually likes to discuss such things with me. And I'm glad I did - it was a fascinating story. (My son also loved it).My two favorite books areRobinson Crusoeand Jules Verne'sThe Mysterious Island- both stories of castaways - and the thought of being on an island and the way they overcome the challenges always fascinated me. In both those stories the castaways build up a society of sorts (even though it's only one person in Crusoe's case) that prospers and flourishes. Lord of the Flies is quite the opposite, where the group degenerates into tribes with disastrous results.But the characters add depth to the story, as well. Ralph, the natural leader, is so happy at the beginning that he stands on his head and sees it as a chance for fun, but recognizes the importance of building shelters and maintaining a signal fire. Piggy is the most intelligent boy, but is picked on by the others for his weight, glasses, and asthma. But he's the voice of reason and supports Ralph's leadership, and his glasses become essential for starting fires. Jack, on the other hand, while also a natural leader, soon grows to resent Ralph's authority and seeks a more blood-thirsty role for his group (of choirboys, ironically) as hunters. It's Jack's acceptance of violence that undermines the democratic order. But it's this idea of law and order that forms the basis for the book - without laws and rules society falls apart. When members fail to fill their role (such as keeping the fire going, or helping to build the shelters, etc.) it affects everyone - especially the most vulnerable (littluns). And without that order maintained by the rules, chaos results.I listened to the audio book read by the author, William Golding, and he offers a few interesting observations at the beginning and the end. I found it to be a very well-written book and full of meaning on multiple levels. It might be a bit dark and disturbing, but it was also compelling and I couldn't stop till I was done. I highly recommend it for those who appreciate a book with some depth."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a very good book.

Psychological components thats play major roles in the story are: power-lust, shame and pride, social status and authority, mob-logic, goals and values, the conflict between immediate pleasure and long-term salvation, sense of morality, and various forms of fear.It's brilliant how Golding uses all these components of our nature to tell a convincing and enthralling story about how peace can degenerate into outright war.I must admit I felt the story was a little boring at the start. But once the drama began to unfold, I couldn't put it down.Whether you're after an entertaining read, or after a perceptive take on human nature, I'd recommend this one to you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I loved this book because it tells the story of true human nature.

Read this!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies By William Golding: Book ReviewBy: Conlan MuellerThe author of Lord of the Flies, William Golding, has many ways of showing the meaning of the book. The terrible human quality that man has, turning savage, doing anything for his own survival, in times of great crisis. Golding shows this point in many ways. He uses a variety of metaphors throughout the story. Golding also bluntly shows this in the book. Golding was born in Cornwall, England in 1911. Lord of the Flies was William Golding's first novel out of many, published in 1954. Peter Brooke made a movie, The Lord of the Flies in 1963. After The Lord of the Flies Golding wrote a variety of novels, essays, and plays. He also won the \\"Booker Prize\\" for one of his novels, Rites of Passage. William Golding lived eighty-two years and died in 1993. Golding does a great job of demonstrating his point of the tale, using school children representing mankind. One of the great ways he does so is with a simple conch shell that represents so much. In the beginning, the children use the conch shell to call a meeting, staying civilized. This is why when the shell shatters it is such a beautiful metaphor for all hopes of civilization being shattered and crushed at the same time. A different approach that Golding takes to simply represent this point is just stating that the children turned into a tribe of savages. Just using the word tribe throughout the story to talk about the group of children is a simple yet effective way that Golding establishes his point. The novel, Lord of the Flies has various strengths and weaknesses. One strength in this book is the use of many brilliant physical and psychological metaphors throughout the story. Though I couldn't establish many weaknesses of this book, I do think that William Golding could have elaborated a little bit more on the background and future of the children of the island. That is just my view though. Overall I believe that Lord of the Flies is beautifully written and does a wonderful job of illustrating this terrible characteristic of mankind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine, your on an island with only your peers, no adult supervision, no rules, many would call it a paradise, but when you emotions are pushed to the extreme, will you be able to survive. Golding asks this very same question in his novel \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"Set during WWII, a group of schoolboys are on their way home from school when their plane is shot down. The boys soon learn that they are stranded on an island with no adults. Many consider it a vacation, a break from their lives once ruled by strict headmasters and parents. The boys are able to start their own tribe with only a few rules. The tribe is ruled by one chief chosen by the boys.As the novel progresses many of the boys are stricken by talk of the \\"beastie.\\" Their tribe starts to divide between the boys who want to hunt and have fun,savages, and the boys who want to put forth most of their efforts into being rescued. The savages slowly start to loose of sense of their old lives, they begin to worship the \\"beastie.\\" They begin to have sacrifices for their god. Through the rest of the novel you slowly start to see how the human nature can be so easily tainted and how quickly we can loose sense of all things that make us human.This is a very well written book, it use of symbolism provides a deep meaning and moral to the story.It is and easy read,only about 200 pages. I would recommend this book to someone with an 8th grade reading level or above. It does have some suggestive themes that some may find inappropriate. If you are looking for a book about the evils of human nature or just a book full of excitement this would be a good one to pick up.*Written for my 10th grade English Class by C.R.K."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked this book because it had a good plot line: A group of boys stuck on an island, and their society is breaking down. This book contains a lot of symbolism, yet I liked it because it is fairly easy to read and doesn't get boring. It is interesting enough that it holds your attention the whole way through.It has a lot of violence, and I don't recommend it if you are sqeamish. It is very graphic. It is mostly easy, but some places get a little confusing. It isn't the happiest book ever written; it gets sort of depressing. I would say it is 10th grade level, because that is why I read it in the first place."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Way cool! I am going to start teaching Lord of the Flies right after fall break. I have been previewing this audio version on may long drive to and from work (about 30 minutes each way.) I was so impressed with Golding reading his own book! I must say I cried at the end when Ralph breaks down---Golding made this book come to life! I also like Golding's commentary at the end regarding the meaning of the book. I would tell you, but you need to hear it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book while I was in high school and thought it was just OK. I just reread it on my own and now that I'm an adult, it touched me more deeply. The bullying and cruelty these boys exhibit, the casual schadenfreude that escalates into violence, had a greater impact on me this time around. I'm glad I reread it, appreciated the message, but did not enjoy it. Some facts of life aree too awful and I prefer not think of them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I couldn't remember if I had read this book at an earlier age so I downloaded it and read it again. I enjoyed this book. What can I say that hasn't already been said. If you haven't read this book, I encourage you to do so. This isn't a book you want to miss."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book begins a little fuzzy, but by the end of the first few pages the explanation for the boys' current situation is revealed: A plane carrying many British schoolboys crashed on a tropical island, and only some amount of them survive. There are no adults. Sounds like your typical survival-on-a-desert-island beginning, right?In a way, it is. For the most part, this book details the boys' struggle to survive under the leadership of Ralph and his intelligent friend Piggy. Ralph attempts to lead the boys under a sort of democratic establishment, and it works, for a while. But the \\"model boy\\" of the school, Jack Merridrew, gains a crazed obsession with hunting. Soon his target becomes a \\"Beast\\" of the island and, aided by his fellow hunters, begins committing criminal acts such as beatings, robbery, and murder in an attempt to \\"kill the beast\\". The boys desert Ralph and Piggy and join Jack's society of madness, believing in the misguided leadership of Jack. However, all that's well ends well, as all the boys are eventually rescued. That's the end of the story, right?Wrong. The true meaning of the book is much, much deeper than that. What you thought was an island adventure is revealed to be an insightful look into the reasons why men do what they do, why certain societies fail, how fear and darkness penetrates man, and what humans do when they are desperate. It also explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition.This book will appeal to adventure-seekers and philosophers alike. It is gripping enough to hold your attention and fascinating enough that you will still recall it months later."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was read by the author which normally can be a concern. However he was an excellent reader and all in all a good listen. It was nice then to hear the author's comments before and after in the same voice."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i was made to read this book for sophomore high school english. the cover made me interested, and so i was openminded when i started this book. the plot is incredibly intense and extremely symbolic (as my teacher drilled into us all the bible references, i started to pick up on them by myself). i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in symbolism, the primal breakdown of mankind, and the thrill of reality. the ending had an unexpected, unpleasant twist, it wasn't what i had wanted it to be, but well, nothing is perfect. this book is definitely a classic and has been read by millions. if not to buy this book, i would certainly suggest reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At this moment, while I'm writing this review there were 632 reviews more, so, why to write another? Just because I have just reread the novel and I feel the necessity to share some ideas. First, although only three boys die out of many (we never know exactly how many boys live in the island)this novel is about &quot;horror&quot; just as it is in The Heart of Darkness by Conrad. Second, all characters are male characters. That is very important in the novel, I think. Try to speculate about the same novel, the same island, the same problems faced by the boys but mixed with female characters. In that case you could go to the extremes: a love story or a double horror story. Third, if you have read Blindness by Saramago you will find many curious and interesting similitudes. Put a group of persons under extreme conditions (boys abandoned on an island or a whole country infected by a new kind of blindness) and you will have the perfect situation for the surgement of &quot;the beast&quot;, that thing so inmersed into human soul that is always trying to get out of the cage of &quot;civilization&quot;. Anyway, Lord of the Flies is a superb novel and it will keep producing many new ideas into quite different minds."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel tries to show the origin or all the bad in the world. The answer give a group of British schoolboys on a lonely island: they create a society determined of cruelty. The moral of the thought provoking book is that all the bad is caused by the bad in the human himself. the theory of baal-zebub. It's a story full of surprises and easy to read. I can't recommend it to everybody, it's interesting but not great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a story, which leads the readers deep into a boys mind during the time of World War II. Golding's book starts out with a group of boys from Britain who are shot down from their plane and is stranded on an island. What these boys do not notice is there is a &quot;best&quot; on the island. This beast is known as fear and the greatness in evil. Golding wanted to illustrate in this novel the dark side of human nature and make the point that each member of humankind has this dark side. Golding uses the boys' fear of a mythical beast to illustrate their assumption that evil arises from external forces rather than from them-selves. This fearsome beast initially takes form in their imaginations as a snake-type animal that disguises itself as jungle vines; later, they consider the possibility of a creature that rises from the sea or the more hazy body of a ghost. When they spot the dead paratrooper who has landed on the mountain, the boys feel sure that they have proof of a beast's existence. In fact, a beast does roam the island, but not in the form, the boys imagine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in high school almost 20 years ago - what vivid memories I still have!!! Golding does a great job of taking the reader through evolution of the group...from the beginning when they work together to the end where they have broken into smaller groups working against each other. The power struggles, the turf wars, and insight into human nature...great book!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It's a true look into the sad ways of all mankind. A story of several young boys trapped on a desert island with no adults to control things. In the beginning the boys want to be organized and stay together, but they also want to have fun. After all, this island is their paradise, no adults, and no rules. Soon, their fun turns to chaos and murderous insanity, and the boys are split into two groups: those who want order and rules, and those who are crazed and just want to have fun. It's a sad book about the end of innocence, but beautifully and truthfully written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the authors purpose for writing this story was to show that all people are born naturally evil, and with fear. I don't agree with the author because I don't think everyone is born evil. The literary element that I think Golding handled best was the characters. He must of done alot of research on them. The names and the characterists fit well with the story. I think the book was believable because it handles fear, and every child goes through some sort of fear. This fear that they had made the story what it is. I really didn't expect the book to end the way it did. It was a really boring ending. Its like he didn't give the ending any thought, or he ran out of time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a high school student, I was indeed forced to read this book. However, I found this book to be absolutely amazing. It was one of my favorite books. Golding has a way with words. His cynicism in the book helps make the book even more inticing. I don't understand how anyone could dislike this book. It deserves 5 stars all around and nothing less."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It seems like, at some point before writing this novel, Golding had asked himself: &quot;How much has the human race changed, morally speaking, since the prehistoric times?&quot; &quot;What would happen if a bunch of children, from an advanced society, got stranded on a deserted island and had to reproduce society?&quot;. So, after a plane crash, only children survive in a remote island. As they struggle to survive, we are witnesses to the undoing of civilization, once some of them, especially Jack, realize that the institutions, strictures and constraints of society are gone. And what we read is certainly frightening: deep inside, we still are savage creatures, bent on getting power and domination over the rest of us. Only Ralph and Piggy keep their will to bring about cooperation and collaboration, as the indispensable way to survival. But the rest won't listen: what they want is to swim and hunt, to play and to fight. The voices of civilization and peace will not only be ignored: they will be denounced and punished. Savagery will triumph over peacefulness. That society will have to start all over again, trodding the path from utmost savagery to civilization. This is not a political or a sociological novel, it is a fable. But something I learned or reinforced from reading it, is that the central beliefs and institutions of our civilization are not to be taken for granted. They need to be constantly nurtured, reinforced and reformed. For our basic instincts are still there, and exactly the way they were thousands of years ago. So, this novel is thrilling, fun to read, and interesting to think about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the flies is one of the finest ezamples of a frightening world created without a lot of razzmatazz and jargon but only a singular and savage imagery .

The author delves deep into human psyche through the means of an adolescent mind.Ralph and Jack are caught in a battle of supremacy while all around them there is the shadow of a certain beast.Ralph builds shelters and keeps a fire going to attract ships ,while Jack hunts pigs for food.

He gets killed in a stampede of animal frenzy by the boys. Meanwhile Jack steals piggys glasses and Ralph can no longer keep the fire going. In the ensuing battle piggy gets killed and Jack starts hunting Ralph like a pig. The killing of Simon and the hunting of Ralph is spoken in a powerful and poignant way. The story ends on a note of irony with a sailor finding Ralph and assuming that he must be playing with his friends."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this classic while in high school about fifteen years ago. I don't remember all the details of the book, but what I do remember is how depressed I was after I finished it. The book makes you realize that the world may seem good on the surface, but that it doesn't take much to release the dark side of most people. While that thought is disturbing, it's actually good to bring out in the open, because then you can guard against it. The book is fictional, but it contains some of the saddest truths about humanity. I'm not sure that common human decency always gets thrown out the window when the structure of civilization is removed, but the events of this book certainly do seem very pausible and realistic.On one level, this book is an exciting adventure story. I would recommend it for that alone. But on another level it is a commentary of the inner motives of individuals, and how those motives affect the entire group. This adds significantly to the book and makes me remember it fondly fifteen years later."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It's often a distinct pleasure to listen to an audio book read by the author, as the writer of a story can bring an added depth, a richness that eludes voice performers. Such is certainly the case with this reading by the incomparable Cornwallian William Golding, the recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize for Literature.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" has become a contemporary classic since its publication in 1954. Who can forget this thrilling adventure of British school boys marooned on a tropical island? After their plane is wrecked on a deserted spot the boys must manage to survive.Initially, the boys use their only resources - themselves, as there is no adult supervision. They make their own rules and way of life. But camaraderie is short lived as some of the boys follow Jack who would rather swim and play, while others are drawn to Ralph as he attempts to bring about order and delegate responsibility.Throughout the years \\"Lord of the Flies\\" has been called a lesson in politics, a parable, and even a myth. Whatever the delineation it is timeless.William Golding recorded his tale in a London studio in 1976. We're fortunate it has been remastered and re-released for our listening pleasure today. It is not a recording to be played and tossed aside; it is one to hear over and over again.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am friendly with a judge who sits on criminal cases. When a young defendant comes into his court, this judge often requires that this book be read as a condition of the sentence. There is much symbolism in this book, such as the grinning sow's head (the Lord of the Flies), and the corpse of the parachutist. However, even if the symbolism is not clear, the horrors of people left to their own devices, without authority figures to guide them, is a potent theme of this book. Reason and civilized behavior, despite the best efforts of the lead characters Ralph and Piggy, steadily dissolve into savagry. The judge says that he has been moved and impressed by the essays that some of the young people have handed in to him after they read this book. I hope that young people, who may be tempted to follow the insensitive behavior of peers, may be affected by this book and follow the course of decent and civilized deportment."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"what doesn't this book have. action, adventure, excitement, war, it has everything. it's written in an easy to understand language (tho' that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll pick up on the symbolism that golding put into everything). and you definately get a totally different perception of the book as you get older (this is my third reading of it, and each time, i get something different from it). i think this should be required reading and that everyone should own a copy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Since a George Orwell reference is obviously required here, I read 'Animal Farm' directly before Lord of the Flies. And I was foolish enough to think that Animal farm is a great book! It can hardly stand on all four legs when measuring up to Lord of the Flies.Just as 'Animal Farm' is a parody of the Russian Revolution, 'Lord of the Flies' is more of a parable for mankind than an inspiration for 'Hatchet'. Every (major) character is a symbol of some aspect of human nature. And what is a literal translation of \\"Beelzebub?\\" Not devil, as you might suspect -- \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"And if the Lord of the Flies is the Devil, Simon is Christ, or pure good -- the only boy brave enough to discover what the beast really is, the only one...crazy enough to understand it, and the one who would be sacrificed by all for trying to spread the words of the Lord of the Flies.No, I did not read this book for class, thank God, or else I would most likely hate it just for that reason. I despise hearing teachers read aloud, I don't know why, and their stupid assignments (What would you do if you were trapped on an island? What would you bring?) completely miss the entire point of the book. This is not a survival story!My edition of Lord of the Flies was printed in the seventies,and it is falling apart (I found it in my dad's study in the basement). The scotch-taped cover is blank white, except for the title and a simple sketch of the head and arms of a boy, head bent like a baby, clutching his hair in anguish. He appears to be covered in blood. Is it Ralph at the beginning of Chapter 11 (you'll see what I mean)? Is it a struggling, uncertain Jack?Lord of the Flies is definitely not a survival story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a previous reviewer noted, _Lord of the Flies_ is a difficult book. There is a lot of symbolism, and the themes and ideas are abstract and become apparent only with deep thought. Yet the implications the author makes about human nature, about ideas we purport to hold so dearly - \\"civilization,\\" \\"democracy,\\" \\"morals\\" and \\"decency\\" - are worth the effort it takes to read and digest.The story line is simple enough - a plane of young boys crashes on a deserted island, and the kids must make the best of it. What ensues is a gradual, downward spiral into barbarism and authoritarianism.It is a brilliant book, making one wonder just how thin the line is between acting like an animal and giving in to our more atavistic side, or attempting to cooperate and behave in a \\"civilized\\" manner.Perhaps Freud (and Jung) got it right - inside each of us is the shadowy remnants of our more primitive ancestors, struggling to get out. We see it every day on the news: the violence in our communities and around the world. And as we sit in our comfortable homes, we have the audacity to wonder \\"how can this happen?\\" Perhaps Golding got it right when suggested that the Beast is within all of us. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is impossible to encompass Lord of the Flies into a short review. Golding just says too much on too many different levels. The book is simply brilliant. First off, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story. A few British schoolboys are deserted on an island and must depend on themselves to survive to be rescued. The story is based on an earlier British classic, The Coral Island by R.M. Ballantyne. The simple adventure story is used to comment on humanity. Golding, much like Joseph Condrad, shows how civilation keeps humanity from lapsing into savagery. He presents the schoolboys' loss of innocence. Lord of the Flies is also a political treatise much like Animal Farm. Ralph represents a democracy, Jack is communism, and Piggy is the voice of wisdom which both tends to ignore. He traces political troubles back to individuals.Many people think of William Golding as too pessimistic about human nature. I do not think Golding was as pessimistic as many think. William Golding was unfortunate to see human at its worst during World War II, and I think he feared lapses. Lord of the Flies is his warning. His attempt to help man stay on the right course. Whether or not a person agrees to this and feels Golding was too cynical, it is impossible to not think of Lord of the Flies as one of the best-written books of the century. Golding encompasses so much into an simple, powerful narrative. The prose and images are beautiful even when grim. Lord of the Flies is certainly one of the great novels of literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Anybody know what my title's about? Basically, this: In the battle between your impulsive, selfish side and your rational, moral side which would ultimately win?The plot of this novel is misleadingly simple. Some shipwrecked British lads must fend for themselves on an island while waiting to be rescued. Their only hope for returning to civilization is to keep a fire burning in the hope that a ship will see the smoke. A leader is chosen. The society is well organized and, intitially, works. Then the &quot;littlun's&quot; confess their superstitious fear of a mysterious &quot;beast&quot; lurking in the woods. Disputes concerning priorities and leadership divide the boys. Gradually, the wilderness in them all possesses them wholly. This is the tragedy in Golding's eyes. Everything natural is condemned, while things of intellect are placed on a pedestal.This book is nothing if not symbolic. Jack is selfish desires (Freud's &quot;Id&quot;)while Piggy is intellect (Freud's &quot;Superego&quot;). Piggy's glasses represent reason. Remmeber this when anything happens to them, and what Piggy is like without them. Ralph is Mr. Inbetween (AKA: Freud's &quot;Ego&quot;). He's the closest to you and me. The conch represents order in society.Pay close attention to the physical appearances of the characters as well. It indicates how well adapted they are to the island. The trick is that those most suited to the island are those most in tune with their instincts and animal desires. THey are the ones who give up on the fire. THey are the ones whom commit the injust acts. THey are the inhumane consequences of total submission to human desire."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding does a wonderful job of keeping this complex story at a reading level accessible to all respective age levels, although parents might want to think twice about letting more SENSITIVE children read the book. I say this because there are a number of scenes involving bloody fights or deaths and less experienced readers might find them disturbing. Overall, the book is great. It's a story of a small group of children marooned on a tropical island then forced to fend for themselves in its wild environment. As most of you probably know, a type of mutiny ensues, and the small band of miserable castaways breaks into two groups, one calling themselves &quot;the hunters&quot; led by a rugged and violent young man named Jack who thinks the most pressing responsibility he has as leader is to procure meat for his crew, and the smaller, nameless group led by the book's youthful father figure Ralph, who believes keeping a lighted signal fire atop a nearby mountain the most important island duty. The book flows nicely and keeps the reader's attention. It's a bit of a cautionary tale much like Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; or Huxley's &quot;Brave New World.&quot; The morals of the story are easily learned and hard to forget, but I'll let you figure them out on your own. If you're looking for something engaging to read, you won't go wrong buying this."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Which is better-to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" This thematic question is the basis of conflict in William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Golding's tale, set on a remote island, is a story of a group of British boys' survival from a shipwreck. The boys, aged from a mere six to twelve, must struggle to go on with their everyday lives, apart from all adults or authority. This separation from society creates this overall thematic conflict: the struggle between the civil and primal natures of man. This conflict is enacted beautifully in this fictional setting. There are an endless amount of symbolic insights that can be applied to this struggle in the heart of man, ranging from as simple as the conflict between good and evil, or order and disorder, to complex Biblical allusions. This symbolism proves to be essential to the effectiveness of the book, because it allows the reader to apply these symbolic ideas to himself. The struggle of the nature of man's heart is a simple yet interesting theme that contributes to the greatness of this novel. One of the most remarkable aspects of the book is the way in which Golding can bestow the characteristics of the differing natures of man's heart through young boys. The boys in his novel perfectly symbolize the complex instincts and emotions of adults without violating the simplicity of children. They speak with a child's vocabulary, think with a child's mind, and still can represent the complexity of mankind. This is certainly a commendable feat on part of the author. The pure adventure aspect of Lord of the Flies is remarkable as well. Golding conveys a thrilling adventure story to create his symbolism through. He expertly uses the tools of literature, especially foreshadowing and description, to achieve a beautifully scripted story of adventure and suspense. This element of having an eventful story line full of action is often absent in pieces with such quality of symbolism. It is difficult to achieve both of these purposes and still end up with a good novel. Lord of the Flies is an extremely easy book to understand, even with its endless depths of interior symbolism. It's length is quite concise, making it able to read in just a few sittings. It is short, simple, and still a classic: yet another commendable mention to Golding. Golding's ability to convey such a story in such a simple manner is quite amazing to me. The only possible foreseen problem in reading the book is the long time it takes to set up the story line. But this problem is soon overcome, for the set-up proves to be valuable to the suspense and foreshadowing aspects of the plot. Lord of the Flies is a beautifully written classic. Its spell-binding story and magnificent structure create a pleasing and worthwhile experience. Golding's novel teaches the reader of the natures of his own heart, giving this piece an educational standpoint. This book, along with Conrad's Heart of Darkness, has given me a deeper understanding of the desires and tendencies of man. This, I believe, is one of the main objectives of the book: to further question and achieve deeper understanding of ourselves and those around us. This message is an important one; trying to understand some of the complexities of humans is a wonderful gift of knowledge that proves itself useful in life. This knowledge never stops growing throughout our lives, and literary pieces such as this one help us to remember this quest for self-knowledge, and the love we all have for it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Why I Thought Lord of the Flies was a great bookBy Gage McMullenWhat if all the rules were taken away,There were no adults,No guidelines.A plane crashes on the way to a fieldtripwith only 1st graders and older middle school kids,the pilots and teachers are dead it's just them.What would happen?At the beach, in my bed, at the caf&eacute; I could just not put down Lord of the Flies! I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the author was not afraid to write about dark, horrible, and gruesome things such as death and violence. For instance when he explains a baby pig getting chased down and stabbed with several spears then having his throat slit by the hunters, it made me want to yell out \\"stop\\" right there in the middle of my room. If you think that's dreadful, there is a part in the book when the opposing tribe takes a large rock and throws it at a boy named Piggy, he gets hit in the head and bleeds to death while falling to the water. It is so horrible and sad but without it the book just wouldn't be the same.My favorite part of the story was when the chief of one side of the island (Ralph) is being hunted like a pig by the other tribe. He tries to run and find a place to hide, when he finally finds a good bush to hide in they light the forest on fire forcing him to run out into the open! You think he's doomed but a ship sees the smoke and comes to rescue the kids. This book seriously sped up my heart and kept it going.But this book isn't just about kids on an island it truly is about what would happen if the rules were taken away, if we had to start from scratch, would we rebuild civilization or would we revert to our inner animal? Who would rise to the top the strongest and toughest, the smartest but shyest, or the handsomest and most outgoing? What would be your job in the tribe make fire, build forts, hunt? What would happen to you would you rise to the top or sink to the bottom? This book really got me thinking so I kept enjoying Lord of the Flies even after I was done. I really loved this book, Lord of he Flies by William Golding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was an excellent book which teaches a hard, but important lesson about human nature. When I read this book I thought it was a well thought out book with plenty of action, suspense, and disturbing turns that keeps you hooked like a horror movie or rollercoaster. Golding made a literary master piece when he wrote this story and I recommend it to anyone without a queezy stomach.The book is basically about a group of British school boys who gets ship wrecked on a deserted island, and over time the kids stop being British school boys and become vicious savages. The main character Ralph was a leader that wanted law and order. But as the kids revert to savages Jack becomes the leader and under him the kids do horrible and aweful things. Which eventually lead to the end of two children's lives. I really liked Golding's use of symbolism, such as the conch representing law and order or the Lord of the Flies representing the devil, this book is full with symbolism. The book has human turn to beast, the very thing they fear throughout the book.[...]The idea that humanity can have a dark side is very important to the growth of any kid. If we can learn that we have these instincts and there are sometimes consequences if you follow them. Then maybe we can become better at controlling them. Its also enjoyable to read if you are the type that like being scared"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read Lord of the Flies during an English Literature class I hated it. I thought that it was dry, boring and more than a little irritating. Then when I reread it more than 10 times over the course of two years and studied every single character and happenstance in depth, I began to appreciate the scope and vision of this literary masterpiece. There is no question that Golding has written one of the greatest novels in the history of time.The Lord of the Flies is at first glance a simple story of a group of boys stranded on an island who get carried away and grow \\"wild\\". Yet upon a second glance we see that it is truly a tale of \\"the end of innocence\\" and \\"the darkness of man's heart\\" (found on the last page as Ralph grieves). Golding explicitly illustrates the primeval power of human nature, a surging, uncontrollable force that let loose from its bindings of society and order, and laws, can run rampant and revert to the way it was in the beginning: complete chaos.Golding masterfully uses metaphors and symbolism throughout the book. A few important examples include the fat boy, Piggy, ridiculed by so many of the boys on the island, is depicted as \\"the voice of reason\\", while Simon, a shy and insightful boy, is depicted in a saint-like manner, a crusader for peace, a Jesus-like character who possesses the only means to bring revelation to the boys. Early on in the book, the boys find the conch, a fragile symbol of societal law and order.We eventually find that Piggy is killed, crushing the voice of reason, as is Simon, crushing hope and goodness, and the conch is smashed, relieving the small society of law and order. With all these three things gone, then darkness rages throughout the island. And who is responsible for the destruction of those three important symbols? None other than Jack, the totalitarian ringleader of his island faction, a Hitler-like representative of corruptness, greed, domination, and overall a person totally given over to the dark side of human nature.Those are just a few of the symbols that are introduced in Golding's book, throughout the novel there are a plethora of many more that require an inquisitive mind to unlock their secrets and achieve a higher level of understand of the constant battle of our existence. This is without a doubt a masterpiece. Golding has created a work of fiction that is not just suited for a younger generation of readers but also for an older generation. At any age, his darkly compelling story is enough to provoke the deepest of thoughts and introspective self-reexamination."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is not just a book about a group of boys on an island, but a story about the weaknesses and evils of mankind that have caused trouble and conflict in our world throughout history. At times the story is frightening and disturbing because of it's harsh and blunt truth,but the beautiful language and symbolism make this book a must read. It is a perfect example of a book about a topic that should learned and understood by all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, it should be warned, is by no means an adventure story of a group of boys stranded upon a desert island. Rather, it is an attack upon our own civilisation, and just how shallow this is.The storyline, as with most great literature, is very simple: A group of boys are left to their own devices on a desert island following a plane crash. Too begin with, the boys manage very well for themselves, keeping themselves in order, making plans for rescue and providing for each other and the community as a whole. Thimgs begin to go wrong, however, when following a series of incidents the group splits down the middle and one group shows itself to be decidedly more powerful and influential than the other. Murders, riots and fires follow, showing the one group to have returned to their roots of animal instincts to eat and to stay alive. Golding successfully presents civilisatin as a farce that could fall apart at the simplest hiccup in the grand scheme of things.The book is a chilling question of human nature, that raises very serious questions about human life and nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's tale is a parody of R.M. Ballantyne's adventure yarn - &quot;The Coral Island&quot;, in which Jack, Ralph and Peterkin, despite being shipwrecked and cut off from civilisation, never lose sight of the public school values and rules in which they were raised. They remain young gentlemen throughout the novel. Golding borrows the names Ralph and Jack for his two principal characters and rivals. But most of the similarities end there. Like all great novels, the Lord of the Flies can be read on several levels. It can be seen simply as an account of the way a group of schoolboys descend into savagery after their plane crashes on an island. They are cut off from civilisation and freed from the controls of parents and other adults, with results that would surprise no teacher who has ever left a third form class unattended for a few minutes. (One can only assume that Ballantyne never taught third formers). More seriously, the novel explores the formation and disintegration of social groups, leadership and the legitimate basis of authority, the appetite for and exercise of power, the results of blind obedience and the way people who are &quot;different&quot; can become outcasts and scapegoats. Piggy, the fat bespectacled asthmatic and staunch supporter of Ralph, is from the first the subject of Jack's taunts and sneers. Piggy's murder signals the death of reason, and the rapid and uncontrollable plunge into savagery. For me, the novel is a reminder that the most civilised society is, at best, only a few good meals away from anarchy and collapse."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of the few rare thought provoking books I have ever read. It is about a group of young boys who stranded on a deserted island during WWII. Realizing their predicament, they begin to create their own \\"society.\\" At first everything is great. There is a leader and then there are followers. However, as the book progresses, another one of the \\"children\\" feels that he is better suited for power and a struggle begins. The two \\"kids\\" both want control over others and their differences split community into two. It is at this point that evil begins to take over. The innocent children have now become savages. Violence, hatred, and even murder can be found. Golding has truly written a masterpiece novel. However, this book has to be examind carefully and cannot be taken at face value. It is a reflection on the evils of human nature and society: greed, the need for power, and the need to destroy. No doubt the violent and gruesome activities of WWII played a role in Golding's attitude. There also several biblical and mythical allusion included. If you haven't read this book, you need to and if you have and didn't like it, you need to reread and examine it. It is truly fascinating"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that this book focused primarily on the flaws of society through the actions of the stranded young men. I thought that was a unique an interesting way to show people how awfully crude our society can be, but the rest of the book was horrid. The killings of some of the boys, and the fact that you are just reading about boys, did not appeal to me. If you like books in the adventure genre, this a book for you. Otherwise, steer clear."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's &quot;Lord Of the Flies&quot; is an absolute masterpiece. It is a fantastic story of a group of school boys stranded on an island. However, with close reading an allegorical underlying meaning surfaces. Golding masterfully creates a miniature society with the boys and proceeds to depict it as corrupt and depraved, using Jack as a violent and tyrannical politician-like figure. When my english teacher first informed my ninth grade class that we would be reading this potentially boring book, I groaned along with my peers. However, within a few pages, I was enthralled. I could not get enough of the lovable and heroic Ralph, the endearing complaints of Piggy, the epilictic visions of the ill-fated Simon, or the evil manipulations of the nefarious Jack and his hunting hooligans. By the end, I was in complete awe and forever raptured by Ralph. In this novel, I discovered my favorite book and my all time favorite character as well."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I, unlike many students, was not required to read Lord of the Flies in high school. If I did, I probably would rate this book at a lower score. Anyway, I always had known the basic plot, so I while back I picked it from the library. I now know why many teachers make this book required reading. Golding puts his view of human civilization with Freudian philosophy in what first appears to be simple story of English boys on an uninhabited island. In the beginning, that is how the novel seems, and it has a cheerful mood. But Golding's main point is that civilization is fragile, and without government people are asking for chaos. He brings Freudian concepts into play, like id, ego, and superego(Jack, Ralph, Piggy). Adults here are represented like government figures, but no adults on the island mean no government. The boys do their best to work together at first, but soon after there is manipulation and mutiny. Symbolism packs this book, not only in inanimate objects, but the characters. Jack(agression), Ralph(order), Piggy(reason), and Simon(consolation that was never realized). All the while the island is presented as a paradise and a lonely piece of wilderness at the same time. Golding puts his message across clearly, and at the same time puts out a good adventure novel. I only had two main problems with Lord of the Flies. One is that overall, the island seemed to be very small and needed more decription of it's physical features, and two, Golding should have put the boys' average age a few years ahead. But those aside, this novel is a good one, being rightful to earn classic status. If you like to read something that makes your brain crank while being entertained, Lord of the Flies is a pretty damn good deal."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a \\"scary\\" story because it's possible - it shows how people behave when under extreme stresses. Morals and ethics are luxuries of Civilization and are quickly shed when you are hungry, cold and miserable. Too bad author was overly influenced by Freud, but other than that the story is fascinating.We tell our kids, \\"There's no such thing as Monsters!\\" The truth is, the Monsters do exist inside of us. The sooner we realize that, the better chance we have at keeping them under self-control. As for kids, the same applies - unless you prefer letting the criminal justice system teach them to control their \\"inner monsters.\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My Thoughts on \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" Is that it brings so much insight and can help us understand ourselves better. The story is so great; it shows how nature and man can combine together and accomplish good or evil. Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good. Overall, this was a very great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First of all, if your teacher recommended the Cliff (by the way, not \\"Clif\\") notes, she has no business impressing the minds of young students. Second of all, I have never heard a more ignorant comment than \\"it [LOTF} has no point\\". Have you ever heard of the argument of the nature of man? Obviously not...you probably haven't heard of the social nature of groups in distress situations or distribution of responsibility. I'm guessing that you have no idea about anything, really. I say this because the themes in this book are not too complex. LOTF covers the basic arguments of human nature that have been explored in the 20th/21st century...but, you were born in a cave so you missed all of that. In conclusion, don't talk unless you have something somewhat intelligent to say."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is an intriguing novel that shows the behavior of young British boys' as they struggle to live on their own on a deserted Island. Golding helps illustrate the thin line between civility and sanity. He illustrates this by showing the behaviors of the boys stranded on the island as they lose their sanity and start to kill one another.Golding starts the novel by introducing the main character, Ralph, as he is swimming and looking for other survivors from the plane crash. Ralph meets a young boy named Piggy and they start to look for other young boys. Eventually they find a conch and Ralph blows it to call all the boys that are on the island. Once all of the children arrive they have a meeting and choose a leader. Ralph was chosen as the leader. When Ralph was chosen as a leader, a boy named Jack starts to rebel against this decision and he gets some of the boys to join in on his rebellion. As the story starts to be more developed, Jack and his followers start to disobey all the rules and then eventually create their own tribe. As Jack's tribe becomes more uncivilized, they start to torture and kill some of the boys from the Ralph's tribe.William Golding shows how even the most innocent children can become uncivilized and dangerous due to the lack of authority, government, and other forms of guidance for a child. I would really recommend this book because it is a very interesting and worthwhile book to read. It will help you understand the need for authority."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a true classic story of a downed aircraft full of boys apparently during a time of war. The boys, of all ages, some how survive and are spread over the Island. The story essentially pits two leaders against each other as no adults survive. There is a distinction between good and evil as the hero Ralph finds a shell and uses it as a horn that attracts all the boys on the island. The shell along with his intellectual yet near sighted friend cruelly nick named Piggy provide him a pedestal of leadership. His chief rival is a leader of a uniformed choir named Jack who commands the group as if it was a Para-military unit. As the search for food becomes more necessary beyond fruit, Jack leads his group on the wild hunt for wild pigs. Success leads to meat for the boys and a power base for Jack as he creates a police unit with his hunters acting as warriors. On top of the fracture among this isolated society is the discovery of a \\"beast\\" on the island, which is actually the remains of a dead pilot still strapped to his parachute. The sighting of this moving but unidentified object in the hills and darkness causes a panic among the boys. This provides a power vacuum for Jack as he takes more control and attempts to undermine the more rational Ralph and Piggy. Piggy is very symbolic not only as the intellect for the group but a source of power in his own right since his glasses help make the fire; however, among his enemies his glasses are more appreciated then his well thought ideas. In between this struggle is the young boy Simon who is almost visionary and fearless in the dark who carries an insight into what is happening on the island and eventually has a clearer perception of what the \\"beast\\" truly is. Eventually there is a violent coup as Jack and his warriors unseat Ralph and take away Piggy's glasses in a heartless control of fire. This escalates to a more severe collision as the warriors and Jack become more ruthless and the desire for power contribute to almost shocking level of violence. The island setting serves as a microcosm of society where rational thought and democratic leadership that is unprotected becomes a victim of a totalitarian adversary that uses intimidation and violence to create its own form of government while making the former leaders suffer violent consequences. At the end, Goldman puts it all in perspective when at the climax of the brutal hunt for Ralph, a rescue team arrives of bright British uniforms causing the boys to all stop and contemplate what they have all done. A book that the young will never forget particularly as one becomes older and you can see the pattern in many governments in many parts of the world today where raw power and self indulgence sometimes conquers what is right and rational."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The time, 1940. The place, an idyllic island setting somewhere in the Atlantic. England transports a plane load of prim and proper, school boys away from the horrors of a European War. The plane crashes and the boys are left stranded on a tropical island without adult supervision. William Golding' novel allows viewers to observe the transformation of even the most well behaved children when left to their own devices. Innocent at first, the boys contrive a make-shift hierarchy based on English society and parental mores. Soon however, a subtle inclination allows the more aggressive side of human nature to evolve and a split divides the once tranquil group. What follows is the natural tendency of mankind to revert to a more primitive and prurient structure resulting in animal dominance, religious fears and murder. Disturbing in it's accusations and terrifying in it's imaginary, the Black and white version is definitely a superb classic by any standard. Brief nudity. ****"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This stroy is haunting,disturbing, and wonderful. The characters in the story are realistic. We have probably all met the arrogant Jack, the thoughtful Piggy and Ralph who is trying to be a fair and poopular leader. The book is full of symbolism most characters, objects, and events have a symbolic message. Although at first the story seems unrealistic you are soon able to see how if people you knew were together without a guide or role model they would easily begin to kill each other. Teenage boys killing each other is the same as war."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when I was fourteen, for a summer assignment. Upon reading it, we were to write a four or five page essay describing three events or examples of symbolism that appeared somewhere in the book. After finishing it, I could barely choose which three things to write about; nearly everything in Lord of The Flies is symbolic and meaningful.Golding has set up a perfectly accurate representation to show to us 'how to trace the defects of human society back to the defects of human nature'. Sure, a lot of the students in my class didn't like the book at all, because of the long descriptions, outdated dialouge, ect., but I think if you're slightly intelligent you should be able to look past the things you don't necessarily like and into the true meaning of the novel, which tells us as much about our society as Ralph's."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On the surface, this novel is a story of survival on a desert island, but it goes so much deeper. It delves into the duality of mankind, the evil within us all, and the power of savagery when the restraints of civilization are no longer present. The main character is Ralph, a British schoolboy, who finds himself on a desert island with his new friend, Piggy, and other boys who survived a plane crash on the island. Each character is a symbol and the \\"loss of innocence\\" genre novel follows the boys' lives on the island and chronicles their descent into savagery. Ralph sees the importance of order which is relevant through his demand for smoke in order to be rescued, and his blowing of the conch, a symbol for civilization. Jack and Roger both represent evil and savagery, while Piggy represents clear-sightedness and intelligence. Simon, the archetypal \\"Christ figure,\\" is the visionary who never gets to explain the TRUE beast to the group of boys. If you want a cute story about life on the island of Paradise, an easy to read, surface level novel- don't read Lord of the Flies. If you truly understand the underlying meanings, you will be appalled with the darkness of man and you'll see the degree of evil that lack of civilization uncovers by the end of the book. Overall, an amazing piece of literature!!!! FIVE STARS! Thanks to Mr. Vasile for the opportunity to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book The Lord of the Flies was an exceptional book though there were a few vacant areas where the plot needed to be moved along faster and more eventful. The book takes place on a deserted island out in the middle of nowhere after a plane carrying some young boys crashes into the sea and the survivors are forced to take refuge on the island. After many days of frightening events dealing with being alone on the island, one boy named Jack, turns into a savage and persuades the rest of the group to leave Ralph, who is the one in charge, to join his wild ways. Many horrible events take place that embed disturbing images in your head throughout the story. It is a unique way for teaching the readers exactly how brutal and harsh being stranded alone on an island with no special form of government or order of any kind could be. The story portrays many real-life aspects about the struggles for power and leadership that the boys go through on the island. It greatly outlines the conflicts between two boys, Ralph and Jack, who are constantly competing for total control over the group. With no grown-ups around, the boys are forced to deal with the harsh reality by themselves. This experience in itself will change the lives of the boys forever.This book is a great reading experience for aspiring readers who are into adventure novels. The Lord of the Flies gives off a dark and mysterious tale that is greatly expressed in detail. The emotions and actions of these boys were greatly presented in the writing in order to give full aspect of what is happening. Overall, we would recommend reading this novel because it is a wonderfully original story that takes your mind into a totally different world of thought. Also, if you are interested in dark, disturbing stories, this book would be an excellent choice because you never know what bizarre events are going to happen to them next."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am a high school senior and my teacher made us read this book it is about the most boring book I have ever read I would not recommend this book to anyone that I know."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my severe dislike of this book, I do not challenge the quality of the writing (though it was not particularly moving to me), the theme, or any other quality of the book. I did find the book immensely to my disliking, however. I couldn't help but to be annoyed as I read it. I do not care how accurate the children's speech patterns may have been, it was obnoxious to have to deal with. The term &quot;littluns&quot; got under my skin and stayed there like a piece of debris trapped deep around one's eye. Also difficult to bear was that the antagonists were too hateable, which really knows how to irritate. The childish ways of the book were simply annoying. Also annoying was the fact that any grown up reader and likely most child readers had to deal with knowing there was no true &quot;beast&quot; from the beginning.This would probably be a decent book to have elementary school students read, but my having had to read it in 10th grade was ridiculous.

But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the killings, and how the boys felt no remorse at all, except for Ralph.

My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders.

Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: BORING.

I believe I enjoyed it (which is somewhat of a surprise since I hated reading then) and found it exciting. I re-read it recently, ~20 years later, thinking I'd have a new found appreciation for it or at least better insight into the story. However, the second time around was painful. The story was slow and boring and I just couldn't find anything interesting or redeeming about it. I struggled to even finish and after finishing it I don't understand why I bothered.I've read some of the positive reviews and spoken with people who were both fond and not fond of the book and I certainly did not catch the greater meaning of some events in the book that those who enjoyed it did. While reading I never got a sense of some great symbolism or insight. It just felt like a bunch of kids trying to appear important, running around an island to me.I would consider reading it again because of the extensive positive feedback the book has received through the decades, but I fear I'll come to the same conclusion then hate myself for finishing it in misery a second time.

So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clich&eacute;, either.

The plot is simple and the characters are presented in a way that makes them difficult to enjoy reading about. The book is around 150 pages, which is strange, seeing that it took me about three weeks to finish because I had to will my eyes to lurch over every page. Other than it being the most uninteresting book one can find, the characters make me equally angry. I realize just as well as the next person that they're stuck on an island and that they're all younger than me, but these children are just unimaginably dense throughout the story. They become so out of touch with reality that they even take to hunting down their leader. What am I supposed to find symbolic and interesting about that? People keep going on about how this book is teaming with symbolism, but I'm just not seeing it, just because you have a bunch of kids stranded on an island doesn't mean that that relates to religion, society, etc. Aside from the characters annoying me at a personal level, the way the author portrays them is even more ridiculous. If William Golding spent half as much time on the plot, and not describing the children and scenery, he may have had a half-decent story on his hands. If someone is looking for a decent book about survival, try &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King, at least he made it interesting to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Oh. My. God. Can we say ATROCIOUS?! One star is too much for this piece of dung. Symbolism is nice and quite beautiful in some places and for certain writers, but this book had WAY too much of it. Golding's novel is very horrendous in the fact his absolutely mind-numbing style immediately drove me away in his tedious and unnecessary description that wasn't even striking in any way. I'll give it a bit for having good description in a few places, but only a miniscule few.But that isn't even the reason for this rating. What I found most unpleasantly apalling was the content of this so-called classic. It completely and utterly disappointed me in its horrific plot that I wouldn't even care to mention. Am I a happy-go-lucky reader? No; In fact, I quite often enjoy the sad and angry scenes in many novels, but an element of this one that I still can't quite name and don't care to that made those scenes so obtuse. This book should be completely wiped off and eradicated from the lists of classics to read and analyze in schools."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Look, I get it. I understand that William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is an allegorical examination of the inherent depravity of the human condition. I get Golding's depressing message that man is a nihilistic savage, when left to his own devices. I understand that Ralph represents civilization, order, and decency (the alleged \\"grown-up world\\"); Piggy represents common sense and the rule of law; and Jack aggression, chaos. . .evil. I totally get the symbolism of a group of boys (innocence) on a remote island sans adult supervision completely devolving into anarchy.Yet I had several problems with this 20th Century \\"classic.\\" The characters were one-dimensional paper cutouts; the dialogue confusing and hard to follow; the description of the island's terrain downright confusing (creepers?). Yet my biggest problem concerned the fundamental, bottom line question: How did the boys get on the island?Yes, I understand that in order for the story to be told we must have a group of boys dropped randomly on a deserted island. The story, of course, develops from there. We are given vague hints that the boys arrived via plane crash--but that presents even more questions that are never, ever, answered. If Golding is going to ask me, the reader, to suspend disbelief and follow his story, he's got to give me more information; otherwise, I'm already holding his tale at arm's length. (Pardon the pun.) Here are my problems--never addressed:If there was a plane crash, where is the wreckage? The fuselage?As the story progresses, the boys' clothing becomes tattered and torn until all of the children are virtually naked. Was there no luggage on the plane?Other than the pilot, were there no adults on the plane? Were none of the boys injured? Are we being asked to believe there was a plane crash whereby all the adults were killed and all of the boys walked away with nary a scratch?All the boys on the flight were schoolboys, but other than Jack and his choir members the rest of the children were total strangers to one another. How can this be?Alas, all of the above made reading this novel a most difficult and unrewarding experience. Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES examines a titanic issue, to be sure; yet to this reader the message was lost because the mechanics of the story were never developed.--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"the only reason for anyone to ever read this is for school word as it has no content to the book as well as the book is just about a bunch of kids turning into sick bastards which again makes me.... sick?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book caught me pleasantly off-guard. For the first half of the story, I found myself interested in the story of young boys on an island trying to survive on their own. As the group gathers on the otherwise deserted island, they begin to form a basic society. Leaders quickly arise, and responsibilities are divided. However, things begin to degenerate as duties become neglected, a power struggle arises, and some of the society decide not to follow the rules. The book's symbolism soon becomes apparent, and the story of boys on an island becomes a commentary into society in general.Golding does a superior job of using symbolism effectively. The symbols are subtle and yet unmistakeable. I found myself staying up late one night finishing the last few pages, and I've found myself yearning to read it over and over."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies keeps your interest from the beginning to the end, from the crash to the rescue. Throughout the book, problems for the boys revolve around the concepts of man vs. man and man vs. nature more often than not. Most of the boys which have come from big cities are not used to killing their own food let alone fighting for their lives on a secluded island without any contact with the &quot;outside world.&quot; After reading this novel Ralph, Piggy, Jack and the rest of the boys are not only characters in a book, but figures which become part of you life. Although the book deals with the lives of younger people, it is definitely a book for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the FliesLord of the Flies is a classic book, written by William Golding. It takes place about 50 years ago on a deserted island during the heart of World War II. It starts off when a group of boys are on a plane and they crash on a deserted island when they get shot down. They were escaping the fictional atomic bomb in England. As the boys all come together in a group, they find that there are no adults on the island and they elect a 12 year old boy, Ralph, as chief. The boys explore the island and find that there are animals and fruit to eat. After the boys settle in, they make huts on the beach which become extremely useful in the future. One day while the boys were holding a meeting, a young child, about 7, said that he saw a gigantic 'beast', as he called it. It was not taken seriously. After that meeting, the boys have two encounters with the beast and the little boy was never seen again. Jack Merridew, leader of the hunters, (a group that they formed to find food), soon leads his group to become extremely barbaric. After getting tired of listening to Ralph's orders, he forms his own tribe and by the end of the story, the remaining members of his group had gone to his tribe. One day while Jack's tribe was out hunting, they killed one of the pigs they saw and hung its head on a tree trunk as an offering to the beast. As Simon, one of the boys, looks at it, the pig's head, full of flies, begins to talk. The pig says that he is the Lord of the Flies and that they must be careful not to overstay their welcome on the island. Simon is so scared that he faints and gets carried off to sea. Later on, through a war, between Jack's tribe and Ralph himself, Ralph passes out from exhaustion. When he wakes up he's greeted by a naval officer on the beach who saw their signal fire and came to get them. Two main losses however were of Piggy, Ralph's best friend on the island, and Simon one of the friends to the younger kids. My favorite character in the book was Piggy. Piggy is an overweight, nearsighted little boy. He lives with his aunt because both his parents were killed when he was young. He is one of the first people on the island to be noticed by Ralph. Piggy also has asthma. Because of this and his lack of being active, he is often made fun of and not taken seriously at meetings. He is loyal to Ralph throughout the whole story until he gets killed at the end. Piggy at the beginning seems a little bit obnoxious. He acts like a 'mama's boy' who would not do anything without confirming it with an adult. He continuously asks Ralph if there are any adults on an island because they give Piggy a sense of security. The reader learns to feel bad for him however because he now has no family and everybody is treating him like dirt. The people that make fun of him though do get put through pain, later in the story. At the end of the story, Piggy is well respected by the reader and Ralph, no one else. Piggy has given a lot to the boys in the story like his glasses for starting fires and giving his thoughts regardless of what other people thought of him. Ralph really cares about Piggy because he was the most loyal person to him in the story. Piggy tries to follow Ralph's rules and go by what he says, but when the two of them are the only ones left that are not in Jack's tribe, Piggy treats Ralph strictly as a friend. If I had to rate this book on a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 9. The book had a remarkable story line, which pushes the reader to keep reading. The characters were completely different and it added a silent war to the story because each character's personality was completely different and was trying to override the other. Some parts, however, were very hard to understand and they required me to reread them. There was a lot of symbolism and figurative language in the story and made the plot very hard to find but when you did, the work was worthwhile."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought William Golding's Lord of the flies was a great book. It had an original plot and was full of suspense and action. I would have rated it a 5 star book but the ending was terrible. At the climax of the book when Ralph is being hunted the author just decided to cut the story off. All in all I thought the book was pretty good"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the reason most people don't like the book is that they do not understand the fine symbolism. I mean, some people don't read between the lines, because they still think it is a &quot;boys on an island&quot; story. Let me tell you something right now: this story is about the fact that humanity isn't all that civilized. The theme I got from this story is, &quot;Civilization is the root of all evil. Evil is the root of all civilization. The two are often interchangeable.&quot; Think on it. Then, if you don't agree, mail me and we'll talk it out."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book speaks for it self its a greatly written book concerning fears and the elements of life. If somebody feels like sending me a more specific review i'm just happy"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The island in the book can be a microcosm to the world. Despite the book itself being sad and a good read in a literal sense, it has much deeper implecations. Just think: in their tragedy, they resort to their most primal nature. We all share the evil of the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; within us. Golding has shown how easily it can expose itself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel, I still vividly recall the brave leadership of Ralph, the understanding innocence of Piggy, the thrill of the hunt, the smell of the pigs blood, and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys. The exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated. However, the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard. Truly captivating and dangerously luring!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The major misconception about this book is that it's about a bunch of little boys trapped on a tropical island. The book is one big sybolism. Why can't everyone see that? And talk about dualities! Piggy's glasses are his window to the civilized world, and YET they start the fire that is the cause of most savage conflicts! Golding's a genius. To those who say that the boys degenerated too quickly, would you rather read an 800 page book tracing their degeneration. And chaos comes more quickly to 9 and 10 year olds than older people. Most of the people in my H English 9 class who didn't enjoy it focused on the 'boys on an island' story, and failed to catch on when the army man said it was a game. Maybe the book is a bit bloody, but come on! These are savages, only skeletons of the civilized boys they once were. This book is spectacular! If you can be open-minded, and can get past 'boys on an island', you'll love this classic tale of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about a group of young British boys stranded on an island. No more, no less."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Themes are the fundamental concepts addressed an explored in any literary work. William Golding writes this novel with the theme of conflict consistant throughout the story. It is the same conflict that all human beings experience everyday. The conflict between two impulses: the instinct to live by rules, act peacefully, follow the moral commands, and value the good of the group versus the instinct to selfishly satisfy your own desires, act violently to gain control, and enforce your will on others in your group. One is devoted to values that promote order, and the other is devoted to values that threaten order. Throughout the novel, the conflict between good and evil is the driving force on human beings by the civilization. He states that when people are left to do what they chose, they are more likely to become cruel, wild and evil.Another literary devise used by Golding in The Lord of the Flies is that of symbolism. Symbols are objects, characters, figures or colors used to represent abstract ideas or concepts. One of the symbols is the conch shell. It is one of the first things that they find on the island and they use it to summon the boys together. The shell became a sign of civilization. It was used to control the meeting the boys held, the boy who holds the shell is given the right to speak. As evil takes the shell looses its power among the boys.One of the most important symbols in the novel is the imaginary beast, which frightens all of the boys. All of the boys are afraid of the beast, this symbolizes the fear that each one of us has inside of us. As the boys become more and more evil and against civilization the more their belief in the beast grow stronger.Another symbol is The Lord of The Flies. The Lord of The Flies is the bloody sow's head that Jack beats with a stick in the forest as an offering to the beast. This symbol becomes more important when Simon confronts it in the glades and it speaks to him, telling him that evil lies in every human being. The Lord of he Flies becomes a symbol for evil or the devil and Simon represents Christ. It symbolizes the natural instinct of power and the cruelty that takes over.The characters and objectives in The Lord of The Flies represtents the novel's main theme or ideas. Every element of The Lord of The Flies becomes meaningful to the exploration of conflict."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book my junior year, and I couldn't believe how real it seemed. It's obvious Golding put alot of thought into it. The book was written to show the dark side of man (or the beast, as he calls it) and does its job well. Highly recomended!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book I read was the Lord of the Flies. I thought it was a really good book. It had a very good hook. The plot was great too. Ralph is the protagonist of the novel who at first is overjoyed to be on a tropical island free from adult restraints. To express hisexcitement, he stands on his head, foreshadowing the topsy-turvy nature of things to come. By nature, he is an innocent, mild-tempered boy who accepts leadership when it is thrust on him. He uses a conch shell to mildly show his authority. He thinks of building shelters to protect them and a signal fire for their rescue. He befriends Piggy, the fat boy that receives taunts and teases from the other boy, and learns to rely on Piggy's intellectual reasoning. Jack Merridew is Ralph's antagonist in the novel. When he is first seen on the island, he is leading a group of choirboys, who are dressed in strange uniform and march military style. It is a foreshadowing of Ralph's authoritarian and dictatorial leadership at the end of the novel. During the novel, Jack is in constant conflict with Ralph, because he feels he should be the leader. There were some very interesting things in this book that kept me interested. When they found the dead parachuter it really got my attention because I thought it was the lord of the flies. When piggy gets killed with the rock it made me mad but I survived. When Simon came running back to tell the other boys what he discovered and they all killed him it was depressing. There was so much death and hate in this book. I really see how it stood for the real life situations. This book is one of the best ones I have ever read. I am especially glad I read it because it was assigned to me to read one of the years before but I never read it. I never used to read books for school. I am so glad I read this book, it is one of the best books I have ever read. And I had to read it really fast."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is truly a masterpiece, a mesmorizing tale of a group of boys getting stranded on an island. The characters realistic and believable, and extremely endearing. William Golding paints a remarkable picture of the island, and its ihabitants. Some call this book evil, but if it is, its becuase thats exactly what Golding was trying to show what human nature is- evil. This is one of the all-time best books ever written, a frighteningly real work of art. Any intellect owes it to his/herslef to read this tale."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, while it may be interpreted as speaking of evil, is a book about how society is based on trust. Without this trust, society falls apart. The story line follows a set of kids stranded on a deserted island; they attempt to organize a society, but the society falls apart when orders are not followed and when leaders are not trusted. This is a great book and should be read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"English/Casserly/Pd.5/HHS\\"Lord of the Flies\\", by William Golding was a very intriguing novel. It was full of suspense, problems, and super-hit characters. The conflict between the boys and who was going to be the leader was quite alarming. One of the characters most picked on, Ralph was indeed my favorite because he was the smartest and should have been the leader of the group of youngsters. This book was great because it was unique and still mellow enough so the reader does not get confused. I enjoyed the tone of this novel, it seemed very real and calm. I also liked the creativity of the author and how he showed the savageness that can be within every person by the scene when the boys all kill the wild boar and put his head on a stick.... The end was a dynamic ending. I liked reading this book and I deeply recommended it to any none-fiction lovers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At first, reading this book made me bored. The plot made no sense and there was nothing to grab onto, just a meaningless story. Sure, it was interesting at first; a group of boys stranded on an island but as the story unfolded, there was nothing new and exciting that made me stay interested in the book.I went along and read the cliff notes to see if it was interesting at all and I realized that there was so much more than just a plot. There was a deeper meaning and symbols for so many things. It brought the mystery back to the story and it was interesting how William Golding put all of these clues inside the blan plot. I found many things for myself about Simon (my favorite), Ralph, Piggy and Jack. I realized what they symbolized and how they brout special meaning to the entire story.This book teaches a great lesson and it really makes you think. It's well worth reading, even if you don't agree on how the story ended or what happened in it. You'llbe satisfied to some point and you will see that HUMANITY CAN BE SAVED."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a horror novel like no other. You won't find anything plainly terrifying, like monsters or ghosts or aliens. What you find is the human instinct, bared for all to see--perhaps most distubingly--in twelve year-old boys, who have their lives ahead of them and who are tomorrow's society.The critical reading of this novel can identify jabs aimed at every human institution: Morality, Government, Religion, Sociality, every man's internal bloodlust. And nothing is safe from Golding's incriminating finger that accurately points out mankinds failings.Perhaps the most startling aspect of this novel is how TRUE it is. We see as the boys parade around the island, making one mistake after another and then creating more; what hits home is the fact that we can identify. We can look at the jealous pathos of Jack, and we know what he is going through. We might even encourage him, because he isn't acting outside of the average human's desires, though he is acting irresponsibly.Golding's book takes no prisoners, when it comes to his critique of humanity, and you won't finish the novel with a pleasant feeling in your stomach, but that, perhaps, is the intention, to recognize all that is wrong, all that depraves us, all that increases our downword spiral, all that makes our pompous idea of &quot;civilization&quot; appear absurd and completely unfounded. Golding certainly does not think that these inherent problems with humanity can be solved, but his intentions are to help us over our denial.The Lord of the Flies challenges the reader to grasp what he has so long denied, and it does so by showing us the simplest, most allegedly innocent of our species as it tears itself apart without regard to those same &quot;civilized&quot; values that it has so dearly prized for so long. The Lord of the Flies is a must-read, but be prepared for what you might find; the scariest of all stories lies in your own heart."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Read this book. It's one of the best ones out there. The writing is good, which is hard to find in a book that carries so many different meanings. Don't worry, it's all potrayed well.

The story was inspirational and categorized by myself to be the greatest book i have ever read along side 'The Island Of Doctor Moreau' written by H.G Wells.

After plodding throught Frankenstein, I was prepared for another book that English teachers love, but that I would hate. Well, I was very surprised, and would say this book is easily in my top 5. On the surface its a classic tale of adventure. But inside its words, is a very saddening yet uplifting view on humanity. As the boys on the island begin to lose their English schoolboy discipline and revert back to uncivilized savages its hard to see the upside. But when Ralph finally gets rescued by his British Navy Officer you can see how Ralph is changed and ready to contribute greatly to our civilazation. A leader who recognizes his own capacity for evil, but by seeing it can deal with it, and push his good to front. As I read the last few words of the book my final thought was &quot;Can't we all just get along!&quot; And what would we be capable of if we did? If this seems too profound, stay away, but if your looking for a great story, and more read it!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book last year in 8th grade. It probably would have been an OK book but it has too much SYMBOLISM!! OMG in every chapter there are like 10 different symbols that you have to think about.

The end was the best part, but it was still bad. l did not get into this book or enjoy it. it was for school."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I did not really enjoy this book.

First if you don't know what the conch is all about then you'd better pick up this book and read it. Secondly if you think you know who the Lord of Flies might be without reading this book your wrong. Third and lastly do yourself a favor anyway and pick up this book, it's a fun, quick read. I liked this story of young boys stranded on a island having to fend for themselves and at the same time trying to keep some sort of organization among themselves as they wait for a possible rescue. But therein lies the problem as their little world begins to turn up-side down as different personalities begin to clash. I felt as though I too was on the island with these kids as I read along. I've said enough now, who wants the conch now?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What an incredible first novel, a story of civilization, how humans create it and how easily it can be destroyed. It deals with fear, and the atrocities it can make people commit. Golding wrote often about the connection between humanity and civilization. Does civilization make us human? This story can mean many things to many people, making it wonderful fodder for literature classes and idle pondering."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"(Marooned)- Lord Of The FliesI some what liked this book it was really for people who like blood and gore kind of stuff.What I didn't like about this book was that it carried on conversaions that really didn't even make any sence at all to this book.If anyone was to read this book Lord Of The Flies I would basically suggest this book only to people who love to picture blood every where. I would describe the plot basically as all about blood nothing much too it just a couple of boys marooned on an island and nothing to do but kill other things, well i won't tell the whole story cause that would just give the book away. Lord Of The Flies is not based on an true story obviously. If there was any other books to come out like Lord Of The Flies I probabaly wouldn't read it just considering it wasn't my type of book to read. I read more of comedy, and ect.When your reading thiis book you can basically look at it as a movie it runs through your head and you can have a clear picture about all of the details and blood.Consider reading the back cover of the book and notice that the author William Sir Golding is writng this book based on the 20th century european fiction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well, most people in America have already read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clich&eacute;, either. Kudos to the author.A+"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In lord of the flies the main character Ralph forms a tribe to try and survive on an island, their only food is pigs. Later Ralph and tribe discover there is more on the island then just pigs. The story quickly shifts tides and becomes a struggle for Ralph to keep him self, the tribe, and the smoke signal fire alive. This book is a great story of the will to survive."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is a haunting sign of the evil within all of humanity. This dark side of ourselves surfaces as external checks are removed, thus, causing chaos in a consequence free environment. These boys are essentially placed in the Garden of Eden, yet they are dissatisfied with what they have. The root of all evil is greed, and this is demonstrated through Jack and Roger, who attempt to control everyone else. It is sad that the young boys living on this island are transformed into vile savages without any sense of conscience. Prior to my enrollment in AP English, I did not realize the importance of rules in a socitey. I now know that without &quot;external checks&quot;, our lives would turn into chaos as well. This book is very scary. It made me cry. It mad me extremely mad. I wanted to burn it! Yet, it taught me so much...maybe a little too much about human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great!! I have never read it, but I'm sure it's a swell book. My girlfriend has read it, and she said she liked Little House on the Prairie better, but I say no. No I say. She will not remain my girlfriend much longer if she doesnt shape up. I like William Golding very much!, maybe too much. But it doesnt change the fact that Laura Ingle Wilder is a communist in the third world. I recommend this book to anyone who has hot steamy fantasies about good 'ole Will. I know Will, personally. And we had something going, until he died of Lou Gherig's disease. I know he would be proud of me, god knows Greta is. Well, I have to go 'cuz uncle Eugene is callin' from the barn. howdy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was incredible. I'll agree with some of the other reviewers who said this is a very difficult book to read. I'm 13 myself, and I had to read parts over before I got the message underneath. Most people will hate this book at first because they don't understand what it's trying to convey. The book isn't just about a bunch of boys on an island, it's about democracy and order degrading into anarchy. All in all, the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This classic tale of a group of marooned boys who attempt to create their own society, (and the eventual downfall of that society) is filled with metaphor and symbolism. It is a story that is quickly read, but not soon forgotten."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is the fact that I loved this book very much. It must be my favourite novel, I've read it about 12 times, and I love it even more for each"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We are reading it in school, and I am enjoying it. I think it is interesting to see how the young boys changed from small angles to wild monsters"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didnt like it at first because there was so much foreshadowing by the author that i didnt know when they were ever going to actually get to the action. It was very nicely done, and portrayed the evil that Golding was trying to get the reader to understand very well. I give it two thumbs up. All of you thinking of reading this, just bear with the book through the first few chapters...it will get better."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First of all, I'd like to tell people not to avoid this book because it is said to be depressing, disturbing and gory! I am extremely opposed to violence, but, unfortunately, violence is part of our way of life. People, I think, shouldn't reject a book because it is disturbing, especially if it relates the truth! If Golding had written about &quot;lots of happy little bunnies jumping under rainbows and making friends and living in harmony&quot; would this book be as popular as it now is? A good book should have emotional power: it doesn't matter whether it makes you feel happy or sad. Most famous books are tragic anyway! Turning away from Lord of the Flies, is, unfortunately, turning away from the truth. Anyway, this book was excellent and it, in my opinion, was an excellent parody of Swallows and Amazons, Treasure Island and Coral Island. I've read all three, and if you compare any of them with Lord of the Flies, you will see how Golding was tragically mocking (for lack of a better word - I'm only in eighth great and my vocabulary isn't that big!) the scenes of happiness and adventure and social harmony that you find in these books. It is interesting to not that two of the main characters in Coral Island (a horrible book, by the way) are called Jack and Ralph (best of friends in Ballantine's world!), which is crudely compared to Jack and Ralph in Lord of the Flies, where Jack's ungrounded animosity towards Ralph leads him to the point of murder! In conclusion, this excellent and disturbing (they can be synonymous!) novel was an accurate and revealing portrayal of the evil side of human nature, which civilization suppresses. PS I know I used he word excellent a lot - I wrote this very quickly."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book allows the reader to see their world in a different light. Thereare so many symbolisms, and comparisons in this book. Look closely. For those who have read it, do you think the story actually takes place? There is no plane. Is Ralph saved at the end of the book. Personally, I don't think so. Look at the book closely there is more to the book then you might see."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is well written and portrays a very deep and meaning full purpose BUT I do not believe that anyone under the age of 13 should read this book. I know for a fact that many younger children would find this book scary and confusing! I read it in Grade11 English and even a few people in that grade can not figure it out. It must be taught by a philosopher and an understander of symbolism. It is not just about some boys on an Island, but much much more! I believe that Golding had a great mission in writing this novel. He wanted to let the world see that people need to change their ways or all hope will be lost. I conclude that for those who didn't understant the book, they need to gain a better understanding of symbolism and irony, and it should not be taught to anyone under the age of 13!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's purpose for writing this story was he meant to send a message out to the readers. He wanted to let us know what it would be like to be free without rules and authority. I think Golding handled setting and symbolism best out of all the literary elements in the book. He described the island so good it makes you visualize what it looks like. Golding also used lots of symbolism helping to explain why certain things happened in the story. Golding wanted to show how young boys would react to being alone and in charge of themselves. It is a good book and enjoyable..I encourage you to read it if you like semi adventure and realism."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this novel I think that the author purpose for writing this book was to state that all people are born naturally evil.I don't agree with the author though.I think that the people are changed into evil and not born into it. The literary element I think the author handled best was characters.I think this because he made each character have their own atutitudes and way they acted.Golding did a good job with giving the characters details. Yes I think this looks was believable.I so becaue everything that happened to them can happen to someone we know or someone we love. I don't think that there was ways the book was less than perfect.If I was a writer I would just make it more suspenseful to make people want to read the book.Thats how I would fix the flaw. stix"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a very good book. We read it in class one day and I started to get sick. We were on Chapter 4 and then I went home. I was sick a whole week, so I know that I missed out on an immense amount of reading. So I got an idea one morning. I told my mom to go buy me the book. She went and purchased it and I begin to catch up on my reading. I really enjoyed this book. I encourage my friends to read this. It was very inspiring. My teacher said that scientists believe that it was based on a true story, but he said they do not have enough evidence to prove that it really happened. In my opinion, I think it couldn't have happened because everyone knew where the boys were traveling to and when the boys came up missing, they could have retraced their route and went back looking for them. This is my review of the book. I attend St. Andrews Middle School and I read this in an AAP Young Literature Class. Now at my age, this book would be considered to a little to old, but I understood it quite well.Audra Williams"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have just finished reading this book,and I must admit, it is one of the best so called &quot;classics&quot; that I have read. The really amazing thing about the book is that it is about a bunch of school boys, and as you begin the story, you realize and accept this fact. But as the story progessed, I found myself not seeing them as children anymore, but as adults..caught up in a life and death struggle for survival, and their sanity. This revelation comes at you startlingly at the end of the book. ( Don't worry, I won't ruin it for you!). Although it is at times hard to follow, because it is told through the eyes of children (I never did fully figure out what &quot;creepers&quot; are!). it is a wonderful read, and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You will not feel good reading this book. You would find many symbols (the way the society works, the interactions between humans, and so on) through the story and their meanings, and may be interested in them, but no joy from the story itself. Too cruel, it will shock you, for sure...."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Wow. This book awed me with it's power. It makes you think... is our essense really so savage and bloodthirsty? The speed of their decline into savagery shocked me... surely they had been trained well by then. How could they discard their taught social characteristics so easily? What also left an impression on me was Ralph... at the first of the book he was pliant to the whims of the mob, pleasure-seeking and immature. By the end he is a leader who laments the loss of innocence and reason. I guess, though I don't usually like books with so much description of the foliage, the reason it is such a worthy book is that I will remember it... I will remember Ralph being manhunted, his fear almost palpable."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"How long will it take for the mores and constraints of civilization to be eroded in a surreal, isolated jungle setting? A group of English schoolboys survive a plane crash in a post- nuclear world, to find themselves on a lush, tropical island, with no apparent dangers and even better-no adults! Sounds idyllic: no rules, no punishment, no judgment for bizarre behavior. Nor anyone to take responsibility for the &quot;littleuns.&quot;But social dynamics quickly emerge, as human nature is released from 12 years of training. Thoughtful Ralph is voted Chief, with bespectacled Piggy his second in command. The right to speak in council is formalized by the possession of &quot;the Conch&quot; shell. Is it human nature to require rules and ritual? Their critical need, of course, is to maintain a signal fire (especially the smoke) to attract a passing ship. For if there is no Hope of rescue, what will happen to this mini outbost of Britian; will they &quot;go native?&quot;Rivalry increases as Jack--leader of the choir boys turned hunters--challenges Ralph's authority, gradually luring many boys to his tribe which offers disguises and promotes violence. Will Ralph realize that he needs to rely on both Piggy's logic and Simon's insight? Could a boy's game disintegrate so quickly into murder? Can Fear evolve into a hideous primitive religion? Is it necessary to create a god of sorts? A gripping tale of the immortal struggle between man's baser instincts and centuries of socialization. A grim must-read for all thinking adults, Lord of the Flies offers great adventure for kids. This is Not a CHILDREN's Classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Within Lord of the Flies 208 pages is a harrowing tale of the intrinsic evil present in humans. Before reading the novel I was a staunch believer that humans are intrinsically good; however, Lord of the Flies questioned my stubborn belief, and although I still believe that humans are inherently good, I am now aware of the opposing arguements and their validity . Lord of the Flies accomplishes such a potent message because we can all relate to the derelicted school boys. We can all relate to Piggy, the one ostracized boy because at times we too are ostracized. By using such familiar themes Golding accomplishes what so few authors have done before: He affected my life... He actually changed a view that I have. I took something away from Lord of the Flies... I learned something. Even though Lord of the Flies can be read as entertainment, it is also a book that one can take something away from. You can share Golding's insight. That is the mark of a good book. Goldings 208 pages have done what Hobbes' entire corpus has failed to do: change my stance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I read this in seventh grade, I thought that it was one of the most boring books I'd ever read. But then late one night, I saw &quot;Great Books&quot; on TLC and one of the novels that they were reviewing was _Lord_of_the_Flies_. Lo and behold, everyone on the show was rave about the book, and they were constantly talking about all of the symbolism. I caught some of it during my first read, but I decided that I was missing something. So I read it again, this time with Cliff's Notes.This really is a great book, if you're having trouble reading it, do what I did and grab a study guide, it'll pay off enormously."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a fantastically written tale of a group of English school boys whose plane is shot down during an atomic attack. They end up on an uninhabited desert island where they are faced with what seems like a perfect situation to them - NO ADULTS!At the beginning, the situation is paradise to them, until they realize that they might be there longer than they thought. They have to learn how to survive.Ralph, the story's protagonist, decides that they should be logical and set up shelters. Ralph is a smart boy in that he is thinking about the good of everyone. Sometimes though, even Ralph does give in to the primitive desires of man and joins the celebration after a successful pig hunt.Piggy, an overweight, nearsighted, asthmatic, serves as the well meaning reminder of what they &quot;should&quot; be doing. Ralph befriends him, even when no one else will listen to him or take him seriously. Piggy's glasses or &quot;specs&quot; prove to be very useful and are a very meaningful symbol of society: the maintenence and breakdown thereof, in the story.Then there's Jack, the leader of a choir of boys from his school. His character eventually serves as an antagonist for Ralph and a symbol of man's primal desires for survival. He provides meat for the group and uses it as a powerful luring agent to get some boys to join his &quot;tribe&quot;.Simon is another character you should be familiar with. My personal favorite as he turns out to be the wisest and most spiritual (not necessarily &quot;religious&quot;) of the entire lot of boys. Simon, prone to fainting spells brought on by epilepsy, is never taken seriously by any of the boys, including Ralph or Piggy. His spiritual nature leaves him far beyond the others' realm of understanding.There are two unfortunate, but dare I say - necessary, deaths in the book but I won't give that part away. I say &quot;necessary&quot; but only on a symbolic level. Once you discover what the characters meant symbolically to the story, you will know what I mean.The ending goes through two extremes. It gets you right into the action in a wonderfully descriptive chase scene which almost makes you feel like the one who is being chased and then takes you right out forcing you to become an objective observer of the scene.Terrific writing, fantastic symbolism and an overall great story. Not for the faint of heart though. I would recommend this one for grades 7 and up."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am only ten so it took a while to read this book. Every night I went to bed wondering what would happen next. In real life I don't think boys would do such evil things. It also has too many stupid British words, you would be better off reading something by an American author. At least they would be able to have a little more common sense and write about something a tad more believable."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was forced to read this book last year, my Freshman year. I was entertained by the PREMISE of the book at first.. but then lost all interest. Let's see here.. a Lord of the Flies Timeline: Day One--Plane crashes, kids gather, etc. They find and are unable to kill the pig. Day THree (aprox) The kids are now half naked, spear-toting, near-savages who cannot agree one anything (JUMP) Day Eighteen--Bloodthirsty, Chanting monsters who kill for pleasure I really think that Golding is a horrible man. We, as humans, DO have a dark side. But for God's sake, it would take MONTHS for the kids to fall THAT far! Years, maybe! (Of course, somethimes people survive just fine...take &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; as an example. Then again, weren't we all hoping for SOMETHING to happen?) Well.. Stay away. Unless you really DO think that people could degenrate so fast."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You could say it was a fabulous book because it demonstrated a point that humans are animals without society... yada yada yada. But a book should be more than that, it should be emotionally envolving. You should feel for the characters, but you just can't in Lord of the Flies. It's OK for illustrating a point, but not good enough to pass for a real novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Several times during my childhood, I was left unsupervised with a group of boys in a swampy woodland for days. We ended up eating snakes, toads, insects and anything we could steal or terrorize from boys scout and National Guardsmen on training exercises. We also disintegrated into tribal savages like Golding describes in the Lord of the Flies. Between these interludes in the woods with the boy savages, I read this book (around age 10) and found it jibed with my reality. The words of the Lord of the Flies struck deep into me, for I knew that darkness well. Some believe the book overladen with &quot;humans are evil&quot; symbolism. Well, they are, and boys do revert to the lowest common denominator in the jungle, despite their best intentions."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Reading this as a school book I origionally dismissed this novel. However the heat from the desert island on which the group of stranded school children were deposited stayed throughout. Their sun bleached hair and sunburn added to the effect.There was a story within a story.One of survival of the children, what to eat how to catch it, all pragmatic aspects. The other is an underlying issue of human destruction of their environment on an island that once was pardise. I believe that some aspects of the symbolism have been materialised out of nothing, make what you will but I enjoyed that &quot;oh yeah thats linked with that&quot; part that you only get with a good book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is a classic. The topics that he covered in this book are amazing. I have read it two times now, and I have found even deeper meaning in it the second time around. It is great for any age, and the book grows with the reader. The moral of everyone having the devil in us all makes for a great discussion in comparisons with such books as Les Miserables. Even though there is some big refrence to Christianity, that doesn't have to be the main focus, so it won't make everyone feel uncomfortable. If you get the oppertunity, read it. Then after a couple of years, read it again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The strong point of this novel is that even people's criticisms are actually good in the book. The great irony is that the boys are saved by a man going off to war. I don't think Golding is making the glossy general staement that people have attributed to him (we are all simply bloodthirsty savages at heart) but that behind every person lies the instinc of survival and of the true key point of the book, the hunt"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I must admit prejudice in my evaluation of this book; I completely disagree with the ideas behind Golding's fairytale. His metaphor is extremely narrow; English public school boys probably WOULD tear each other to bits if left unsupervised, but this says more of the British public school circle than it does of the human condition. I also don't trust the idea of our instinctual savagery, and the need for tightly structured hierarchies. Of course Golding shows that &quot;civilization&quot; doesn't eliminate violence and savagery; not in the boy's own island structure nor in sophisticated nation states. So, if you kill one person and it's murder, and if you kill 100,000 people it's foreign policy, which is better? I'm not sure that Golding really answers that question. However, he seems to say that our options are limited to this killing, either murder or war. Man is destructive. I disagree, so this book puts knots of exaspiration in my stomach. I don't believe we are doomed to cruelty; we all possess empathy, reason and creativity. The somewhat fascist undertones of this book, in perfect accord with our hierarchal society, bothers me. I wish there were other books in the school curriculum to balance out points of view in the classroom. This Hobbsian tale shows a point of view, but is not the whole truth of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In William Golding's allegorical novel &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; he exposes men and society as basically evil at heart and corrupt. Excellent symbolism and plot. A true classic!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book a year ago, but I still remember almost exactly what happened. The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's &quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when i was 12 and now im 14 and just recentlly re-read it and this book is awesome its really cool for normal people who just like cool stuff but for all y'all deep-thinkin people who care about a book having some hidden meaning its got that too so pick it up read it like just do it.~rob"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some people were right about how the author tends to go on and on and on, yapping about trees, rocks, sand, etc. on the island. In the novel, the descriptions were too monotonous and I did not notice that i was skipping vital parts of the book that were hidden between tedious plant matter...But once I started re-reading certain parts of the book, I've realized why the book won that prestigious whatever-its-called prize. It really did tell of the horrors of humankind that outweigh the good, and it's symbols were powerful, especially the lord of the flies character.The character I admire the most has to be Simon. Then maybe Piggy or Ralph. But Simon is a symbol of the good of human nature. Simon helps the \\"lilluns\\" reach the fruit, he gives Piggy his meat, and admires nature in his special spot in the island. He represents human instinct, but not the bad kind, not the one of selfishness and savage, but of goodness and kindness to everything as a whole. The sad part is that there aren't many people like Simon, and in the end, he is taken over by the evil, the \\"darkness\\", the \\"beast\\" that exists in the savage kids, and essentially in everyone. And sadly, before he could tell everyone his discoveries.What i find quite strange is that in the end, the savage tribe is saved by their own device. That's funny, and it didn't really seem fitting to the book's nature. But it worked to it's advantage, as it signify's the loss of innocence in the boys.When people say that this book is unrealistic, I ask them, \\"Well have you ever got stuck in an unknown Island with a bunch of kids you don't know for a couple of months?\\"The children in the island represent society. Using children as a symbol only makes the effect of the novel stronger. A society that would rather listen to their instincts than reason (Piggy), the book plainly displays the darkness and evils of mankind in a nightmarish and cruel way, and perhaps that's why some people refuse to accept the main ideas of the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book shows the inocence of a child and the agreciveness of nature. teaches some people a leason that not all that you see is what it seems. As the traped students show there agresivenesss towards the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was absolutely thrilling! The tale of a group of boys who are reduced to killing each other is a welcomed change from literary pop culture. The author does an outstanding job bringing out the dark side of human nature which civilization hides.This book is about a bunch of British boys who become stranded on an island. Ralph, the chief, tries to establish a functioning society with rules and laws but his little tribe of boys is corrupted by the dominant, jealous Jack who promises the boys meat, killing and glory. Ralph attempts to bring survival back into perspective but is only taunted and abandoned.This story is a masterpiece and I would recommend this to any daring readers. The story grows not less but only more haunting in time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There is only one reason that I chose this book it was because it is a non fiction book and also the cover of the book, the book cover has a face of a person, insects, and some plants. The cover is so interesting. It shows some real tips about surviving on an island.This story is about these boys going on a trip and there plane crashes on an island. When they are conscious again the boys find out that there parents died and only the kids were alive. They attempt to gather food and they learn how to survive. They show a lot of strength trying to survive almost without any modern technology. They called up a meeting and they learned skills how to survive.I liked this book because it is a very interesting book about the survival skills. To be honest I also liked it because it was very short. They book is adventurous, funny, and exciting.

It is probably the greatest book I've ever read, and here's why. I was absolutely fascinated with the characters. They were all so interesting and they always had me expecting something. They all had their own theme. The book is full of themes and mostly each character represents one of the &quot;presidents&quot; of the theme. For example:Ralph is a leader in the book. He represents democracy in an anarchy based society. This is just one of many examples of theme used in the book. Another thing that was important to the book was the setting. The setting always played a special part in the book whether it give rest to the reader in between tense moments, or provide a source of imagination in the action packed parts. The plot was very believable even though it was a fiction book. I would reccomend this book to anyone over the age of 15. It has a very deep meaning and may not be understood with the mind that hasn't been exposed to some of the things in this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the last books my class was to read in English in our senior year, William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is considered by many a classic, but it as more of a haunting portrait of the loss of innocence and the degredation of humanity. The story revolves around the Cold War, a nuclear war has begun and the children of England have been evacuated in airplanes. One of the planes crashes on a tropical island. At first, the children are led by Ralph, who calls assemblies by blowing on his conch, his fat but wise friend Piggy, and the seemingly flat out weird but helpful Simon. But when Jack, a hunter of the wild pigs on the island, challenges Ralph's rule, chaos ensues, and this tropical paradise becomes a living hell for Ralph, Piggy, and Simon. Golding's sense of symbolism makes the book work, from the very beginning we know Ralph is the good guy and Jack is the unprecidented evil in the making. Even the title of the book is an example of symbolism; when Simon encounters \\"The Lord of the Flies\\", we see this (the title is the definition of Beelzebub, which is Hebrew for Satan), but its up in the air whether Simon had a sixth sense or if he was just crazy when he encountered \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" (Simon as well symbolizes Christ, he helped the younger children, gathered food, and built the huts along with the fact he was tempted to join Jack's crew). Undoubtadly one of the best books I have ever had to read for school, William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an essential read for everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a great read for anyone who questions the need for rules in society. Golding uses a group of boys stranded on a desolate island to portray life without enforced order and civility. The boys represent many different types of people in society. My favorite characters are Piggy, Simon, and Ralph. Piggy is the intelligent, fat boy with asthma and glasses. Simon is the sensitive, shy boy who shares his meat and helps the younger children get fruit. Ralph is the chief of the boys who struggles with reality and responsibility. He must face his antagonist, Jack, who is a power-hungry boy obsessed with hunting. It is captivating to follow the steady conversion of the boys from sensibility to savagery. Golding makes a profound statement about society through his character development and vivid descriptions of the boys' daily activities. Lord of the Flies is full of suspense, surprises, and meaningful messages. It sheds a whole new light on the neccessity of civility and rules."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a very good novel of a survival tail that turns into a look at the working of a closed off socity.

This book was not exactly what I would call an adventure but it brought some interesting things to thought. Basically what you have at the beginning is I'd say around maybe 50 kids (no adults) even though only a few of them actually have a part and by the end you've got savages running around killing each other! This book really shows you how screwed up man kind really is- and these were only children. It shows you everything that is wrong with society today by bringing up all the defects in human nature.Many people think it's just our society that has messed the world up but in reality, no matter what we do human nature is going to spoil it in the end. When you read this book you'll become frightened when you finish and piece all of it together and realize exactly what it is showing you. But hey- read it for yourself and find out.

I had heard references to it here and there, but never quite knew what they meant until I read it. I must say, this book is a deep down excellent read. You can see it in two perspectives. One, you can read it without any symbolism, and see a cool story, or look at it and take a exhaustive symbolism look and find a much cooler story. Golding is a perfect author in this story and the characters are far ore then what they are. This book features things that you wouldn't expect 6-12 or so year olds of doing. Such as canabalism, and even murder, as well as attempt of murder. It features not only a sick psychological perspective, but also some really light sci-fi."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is extraordinary in recreating the images and trial of Jesus Christ. Lord of the flies is the best book written for high schoolers because they can totally identify with the relationship between Jack and Ralph. The theme of this book is the classic good verses evil, in an interesting, believable way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is brilliant, of that there is no doubt. It's painfully realistic, and I have no doubt that events on Golding's little fictional Pacific island could have unfolded exactly the way he led them to unfold. But my sense is that he presents the ugliness on the island as a sort of inevitable side of human nature, and certainly if we look at the larger world, with all our wars, genocides, and general crimes, this might seem true.But here is what he misses, and totally misses: the only reason people behave so horribly to one another is that they were traumatized in their childhoods and have not resolved their traumas. The horrors on his fictional little island result from unresolved trauma, not from human nature.A brilliant prequel novel to Lord of the Flies would involve following the childhoods of the most troubled boys in the group, particularly Jack and Roger. Their narcissism, sadism, and sociopathy could not simply come out of nowhere. The reality is, kids like that are not born that way, and anyone who believes they were (the \\"bad seed\\" theory) is profoundly in denial. They were treated horribly, most commonly by their parents, and they were made that way. All the terrible things that came to pass in Lord of the Flies are acted out, metaphorical (and sometimes not-so-metaphorical) expressions of the terrible things that had been done to them.Golding missed this in a big way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read this book my sophomore year, I thought I was reading one of the best books ever written in my life. I would say that Golding's message to this story, during World War II, makes a symbolic point that every male/female has the sinful nature inside themselves, and that if there is no order in us, then we become savages just like these boys on this lost island that are misbehaving and are uncivilized. The colors and items used in this story symbolically were the conch shell, the pigs, black, white, red, the speckles (glasses), and the island. Overall these symbols represented savagery, leadership, life, death, and isolation. People that are into historical fiction and suspenseful views should read this book because everything Golding displays in this book makes great quality of symbolism and has a great climax to this book. In my opinion, I loved reading this book because it felt like as if I were in the story and I actually learn a lot about how \\"civilized\\" people become \\"savages\\". This book is perfect to read and I hope other readers enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was happy to receive the book in good condition as stated,and much sooner than the time frame provided.

But what I always want in a book review is a description of the binding, so here it is. The Classics of Modern Literature Series has done an excellent job in printing handsome modern classics, including 'The Godfather' and 'The Once and Future King'. This book has no dust jacket, the colors and lettering are printed on to the cover. I find this preferable, because dust jackets are a bit of a hassle. There is no lengthy introduction, and the last page of the book that has writing on it is the last page of the novel itself. So this book is very straightforward. It does have a bar code printed on the bottom of the back cover, which may not bother some, but I don't like it. Other than that though, I don't see how they could have done a much better publishing job. This is a great edition of a great novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel shows that there is an evil side inside man and how important rules and laws are to the human society, without them humans would just be animals. This is very important, history should not be repeated. Anarchy sounds nice, but humans need restrictions to prevent chaos. Golding wants the reader to realize human nature and accept it, that we NEED the rules.However, the reading can be at times difficult because time skips around and you don't really no when everything is happening and how long the boys have been stuck at the island. Ralph (the natural leader), Jack(helpful at first but then becomes the animal represented in all of us), and Piggy(the brains) are the main characters. Ralph and Piggy are the continuing forces of logic in the group, they hope that society will save them, the adults will come, they will be home, and everything will be all right.Ultimately the reason that their society fails is not because of the fire, the conch, or the logical Piggy's death; but because of the animal that resides in every human. In the end when the naval officer comes, he comes not because of the structured fire that Piggy wanted to create but by Jack's massive fire that was going to be used on Ralph. The savagery of the island led them to be saved. The line between savagery and civilization is thin. All the events that led to their rescue, show the increasing brutality of a person. The conch that symbolizes law and order breaks, Piggy dies, and Jack gives in to his animal nature faster than any on the island. Their society fails because of the restrained beast that is man who was only released on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Why this book is mentioned so often. it is the type of book that strikes you during the read, but more importantly, it i a book yull think backto more often than you'll at first realize. it's an easy read, and a great one at that. definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, by William GoldingIf you read any other review of this book, you'll find pages and pages of thematic analyses--this book just lends itself so well to such things! However, I hate analyzing books. It seems to take some of the magic out of the trick; I'm still amazed at the skill of the artist, but I no longer have that feeling of awe--I could do it if I practiced enough!This coming-of-age-like story revolves around a group of British boys who are evacuated from some place (it doesn't say where) by plane. Unfortunately, their plane goes down on an island, killing their pilot (the only adult amongst them). The boy who is our guide for most of the story finds a conch and blows it, causing all the stranded survivors to gather.Once the gathering is accomplished, Jack, who had been the leader of a choir, declares himself leader of all of them. The boys don't like this and so hold a vote, voting Ralph (our guide) into the position of Chief (interestingly, it's because he looks like a leader...not for any other better reason). Jack doesn't much like this, but he goes along with the group's decision, for a while.Piggy, the \\"scientist\\" of the group convinces them that the best bet for rescue is to build a fire and keep it going at all times. Ralph concurs, and so they start building shelters and set up a signal fire. Jack decides they need meat and heads into the forest to hunt. Finally finding pigs, he pulls off the fire-tenders to help him take down the animal.Of course, that's the moment when a boat appears in the distance. Ralph sees it, and looks to see if their smoke is visible. Finding it's not, he tears through the forest and catches Jack and his \\"Hunters\\" celebrating their kill. He chastens the lot of them, further widening the gap between himself and Jack.Their civility devolves further from there resulting in further falls from grace, up to and including murder. In fact, they're about to kill Ralph when a Navy Clipper shows up to rescue them.If I were to use a 5 star rating system, I would give this book 6 stars. It's just an amazing look at how society could devolve into chaos; perhaps not the only way, or perhaps it's not even certain that society would devolve, but definitely a believable account. It's almost like a post-apocalyptic story.As an added benefit, this book has been the target of all kinds of hatred, being banned from schools several times since it was written--I did mention the children committing murder, right?Memorable Quote:The tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach between the water and the white, stumbling stuff near the palm terrace. Ralph chose the firm path because he needed to think, and only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them. Suddenly, pacing by the water, he was overcome with astonishment. He found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life, where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one's waking life was spent watching one's feet...He lost himself in a maze of thoughts that were rendered vague by his lack of words to express them.For more book reviews like this, please visit[...]"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was an exciting and adventurous fiction novel. It completely demonstrated a unique and interesting plot. School boys are forced to live by themselves because a plane crashed on an island. There are so many ideas that could be thought of with this one situation. The author created this situation and developed it into a made up society of kids who try to work together but end up turning against one another. It is a totally realistic way of describing this rare, fictitious occasion. I liked how there was an unexpected twist of Simons death after he realizes that there is no beast and that the beast is a fear within everyone. Ralph showed many leadership qualities as he instructed everyone to do the right thing and maintain their signal for help. Jack is entirely against him and wants to hunt to stay alive instead of follow Ralph's commands. This creates the dysfunction among the boys which is the worst thing that could happen. I could tell at the beginning that Piggy a target since he was previously picked on and was portrayed as fat. He is later killed by the other tribe. I thought the end was somewhat predictable. I had a sense that they would be saved sooner or later. The officer ends up coming to their rescue."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i found the book to be very true to the nature of humans. children especially. i was disturbed by the killings of course. and i found myself daydreaming a lot about how girls would have behaved in the same situation. i didnt see anyone being beaten to death in my daydream. a lot of fights. but no beatings. maybe wishful thinking. i would have liked (spoiler alert) the ending to extend to them being on the ship. but it was a good ending just the same. i was confused as to what on earth the title meant. it seemed like it was aimed at the boys being flies.duh. but after getting further into the book it didnt fit because no one was really in charge. then it turned into being about a pigs head? maybe i will have to think longer on it since i just finished the book. not something u will want to read or have read by kids though. it is dark"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Flies that Plague Us All\\"The most influential novel... since Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.\\" - Time William Golding's amazing novel, Lord of the Flies, is a thoughtful allegory that should be read and pondered by all people. The seemingly simple plot covers a world of intriguing themes and symbols. The diverse characters shape the storyline while at the same time represent ideas and concepts with deeper meanings. All should enjoy this marvelous novel.The book begins when a group of English schoolboys are stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific. A terrible storm causes their doomed plane to crash and with no adult supervision, the boys run wild. Initially, they elect a chief and call group meetings to discuss important things to do such as building shelters and maintaining a signal fire. However, as the boys bask in the joy of their new found freedom and find no limits to hold them back or adults to punish them for misbehaving, they begin their fall from the heights of civilization and order to the depths of chaos.In the novel, written after World War II, Golding portrays his views on society through symbolism and themes in the novel. One of the themes explores the nature of evil. The boys become very afraid of a beast that they are sure exists on the island. One of the boys, Simon, however, suggests that perhaps the evil is within them and not in the form of a beast. As the boys become more malicious in their acts toward each other, they undergo a terrible experience in which they lose their childhood innocence. They are no longer the good little boys who arrived on the island. Golding also makes a point about civilization and savagery. Towards the end of the novel, the boys signify that they have left civilization behind by smearing blood on their faces as war paint and making animal sacrifices. In addition to themes, symbols are widely used in the novel. The boys use a conch to call group meetings where each boy can voice his own opinion without interruption. The shattering of the conch signifies that the boys have lost their last shred of civility. By using symbols and themes to express his ideas, Golding has created a spectacular novel.Although the characters are only boys, they represent mature concepts. Ralph is the elected chief of the boys and is the image of kindness; he represents democracy. However, although his kindness is what gets him elected it is also his undoing. Jack is Ralph's opposite, using the boys' fear to govern them as a tyrannous dictator when order crumbles. Simon is quiet and spiritual; he is the one who realizes that the supposed \\"beast\\" on the island exists only in the boys' imaginations, and that the evil lies within the boys themselves. The scientist among the boys, logical Piggy, is the backbone of civilization. He helps Ralph make decisions as chief and is his loyal friend. A sullen, mysterious figure, Roger is probably the most feared of all the boys. He has no conscience, and without adults to administer punishment, Roger knows no limit to his horrific acts. By presenting the readers with these characters, Golding enhances his work significantly.Lord of the Flies is a stunning book that you should definitely read. All the elements of the novel hold the reader in a tight grasp all the way to the end. The themes and symbols are delightful to contemplate and certainly open one's mind. Golding's characters are very realistic and easy to believe. Readers aged thirteen and older should read this novel by all means."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's first novel has been read, most probably by most people, when they were at school as Lord of the Flies has long been a staple text of GCSE English classes. As a result many people read it at an age where they are filleting its pages for 'symbols' to be reprocessed in exam answers, and sniggering at innuendos such as blowing the conch.All of which is a shame, as Lord of the Flies articulates a theme of the innate savage just under the surface of civilized man. A trope that has spawned a thousand imitators in films and books since, but Golding's novel was probably the first. Beginning as a deceptively simple fable about some well educated British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash, the allegorical story traces their descent into frenzied barbarisim.Golding himself was a schoolmaster for a number of years, and he knows exactly what boys are like. If they are not strictly regulated and controlled, chaos is the inevitable result."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I listened to this book during my commute to and from work, and was impressed that the reading was done by the author. Though he did not make the characters sound any different (so at times it was difficult to tell who was speaking), this was tempered by the fact that his accent fit the story quite well and his comments before and after the reading were particularly insightful. The story itself focuses on the most basic characteristics of the human race, and the struggles that result between those various characteristics. Though this is considered a young adult read, I enjoyed it and looked forward to listening every day."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Have you ever thought about being stranded on an island with a bunch of other boys? Well that's exactly what happens to the main character named Ralph in the book Lord of the Flies. Lord of the Flies is a realistic fiction chapter book written by William Golding. The plot of the story is fairly simple, a bunch of boys get stranded on an island and try to get rescued and not lose their minds. The main characters in the story are Ralph, Jack and Piggy. The boy named Ralph is the character the whole story is basically built around. The boy named Jack is the bad guy in the story. Jack and Ralph start out finding each ok but then start to have problems later in the story. Piggy is probably the smartest out of all the boys. Piggy has asthma and is overweight so he can't do that much manual labor. I personally think that Piggy is the best character in the story. In Lord of the Flies there are beasts and caves and wild bore hunts. The story has a lot of adventure and savageness to it.I really liked Lord of the Flies. I think this story really expresses the point that we need grownups to keep children in place. I've always liked realistic fiction books. They usually have a lot of action and adventure. Lord of the Flies has a lot of action and adventure in it. So if you enjoy books like that I think you should read Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is an exciting novel about plane crash that leaves only boys on a desert island. The boys on the island start civilized and organized, but quickly break away from civility and erupt into chaos. Golding offers highly developed characters such as the main character Ralph; he starts out as the chief of the boys. He is a suitable leader, and he represents what is right and logical. Another boy who becomes his adviser is piggy. He is not respected on the island, but Ralph sees that he is actually very wise and values his ideas. The antagonist of the book is jack, who you will learn to hate throughout the book, at first he seems like a simple bully, but as innocence is lost form the island he turns into a controlling dictator.What is so interesting about this book is the spontaneous events that keep you interested. Right when the book starts to get slow at some times, Golding introduces a new struggle or something new on the island. The theme of this book is the loss of innocence of the boys. At the beginning are an organized democracy, when times get harder on the island the boys could go as far as murder just for the pure bloodlust of it. It shows that when boys have no supervision or adults implanting good morals on them they start wondering how much they can get away with. Golding shows that society on the island it not responsible enough to plan for the future and instead they just give into simple wants. This is allegorical for Freud's theory of Id, ego, and superego. The boys lead on the island, lead by jack are the id. They only follow simple wants and do not look at the bigger picture, This proves harmful because a group of boys without w set of rules and only governed by simple wants turns into savagery.The Lord of the Flies is more than just another survival story; it had a much deeper meaning. One of he characters in the story is a perfect example of a Christ figure, he represents what is innocent and pure, but he passes along with the presence of innocence on the island.William Golding does a wonderful job of supplying very distinct images on the island. His writing style changes throughout the book from calm and orderly to chaos and complete anarchy. He supplies very tense moments and exciting events on the island. He doesn't get too much in details with the character's emotions, he doesn't go out and say them. He has a way of showing the characters emotions through their actions towards other characters.I suggest this book to anyone who will enjoy a thrilling plotline. This is a very suitable book for young adults around 9th and 10th grade. This book is also very intriguing for any guy. Girls can enjoy it, but I think that it was more aimed towards guys. It teaches good moral lessons about how order is necessary to survive and we a nothing but savages without it. The Lord of the Flies is an excellent piece of literature that will be read for many years to come."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was fortunate to read this book in the 8th grade, it explained all the social interactions of Junior High School. Unfortunately many people never get past Junior High society. The popularity of Survivor has demonstrated this, the weak, the different, and the above average are rejected by the collective might of the average and mediocre. No dissent or thought is encouraged or permitted. An elite few determine what is correct and acceptable. Here is the social model of Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, you are free to say whatever you want, as long as you agree with them. Personal attacks replace any debate on issues. It is no wonder this book is no longer used in public schools, it raises to many embarrassing issues."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this enticing novel, Golding illustrates the effects of society--or lack of it--on our human nature. He argues that human beings in a society need set of collective guidelines to keep order and prevent chaos.Golding uses thoughtful symbols on the island to enhance his book. The conch is the symbol of order in society. Just landing on the island, the boys first used the conch to assemble and to speak, eventually, however, they got rid of it, and chaos started to reign.Besides the use of sophisticated symbols, Golding assembles very thoughtful characters to form his plot. Simon's encounter with the pig's head makes him the Messiah archetype, or the rational being on the Island who alone discovers the spuriousness of the Beast. Beside his parallel encounter of the devil in the wilderness, Simon is the ultimate sacrifice who gets killed by his evil friends. Ralph is the primary representative of order, civilization, and productive leadership in the novel. While most of the other boys initially are concerned with playing, having fun, and avoiding work, Ralph sets about building huts and thinking of ways to maximize their chances of being rescued. Jack is the novel's primary representative of the instinct of savagery, violence, and the desire for power, making him the antithesis of Ralph.I personally learned a lot about group work from this novel. Personal themes that I found important were: staying focused on your goals and take your responsibility seriously. In the novel, the goals of the boys started shifting, from lightening a fire to be rescued, to killing the Beast and chasing a wild dream of their imagination. Because the boys digressed from their supposed roles on the island, and instead roamed the island hunting and searching for the Beast, they turned into savages and delayed their rescue. Also responsibility is a huge lesson in the novel. When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire--which had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain--has burned out. Jack and his followers not only ruined their own chances of being rescued but their friends' as well. To be successful in a group project, as a whole we must focus on our goals and not get distracted. In addition, each person might do their responsibility well because other group members are counting on them.Overall I thought Golding's novel had strong themes with great usage of symbolism."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Was it Ronald Reagan who said, in effect, that man is always one generation away from barbarism, with the necessity of civilizing each generation anew? Well, if it wasn't Reagan, then it was someone else, because I didn't come up with it myself. The thin line between civilized man and the barbaric has proven to be rich material for a number of writers. But there is a reason LORD OF THE FLIES, William Golding's classic about a group of boys stranded on an island, stands out.By focusing on children, Golding is able to use the characters in the book to maximum effect. As the young have not yet been fully socialized, their devolution into barbarism, as happens when the group of boys splinters and they turn on one another, is more effective. And each boy can play an archetype, Ralph the symbol of civilization and order, Piggy representing man's intellect that has allowed him to evolve from the brute to the gentleman, Jack the killer in the core of each of us, with a degree of realism that would seem more stiff and artificial if these were adults.Golding realized that the push into savagery need not be a hard one, and little clues are sprinkled throughout the text symbolizing this. Jack was the head of a choir group, bringing to mind sounds of harmony, and symbolizing the religious and its black letter rules against killing. Yet it is Jack who immediately rebels against the authority of the group and the order it represents, going off first to do the killing of animals, then forming a rival authority that shows an equal disregard for human life. Even his name - Jack. Like that other Jack of British fame - the Ripper. The kiln of British society fails to completely purge man of his cruel nature.The most potent symbol, though, is the beast that the boys believe inhabits the island. It does. But that beast is within themselves, as even a casual reader could deduce.Finally, when the boys are rescued, the man who finds them cannot help but ask, incredulously, that they are British, right? Britain was seen as the height of a civilized society, not like those savages in the lands of its mighty empire. But, oh, how short that distance really is. That the rescuer is an officer with the British Navy, not only a symbol of a great power, but the force which kept world order through its policing of the seas, heightens the effect still more.THE LORD OF THE FLIES did not become a classic simply by being assigned to high school students year after year. It is a worthwhile read at any age."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"great book, great storyi've seen the movie way too many times to be surprised by anything in the book, but i've always wanted read itto think the book is far fetched or impossible is stupidity, the book is right on the money, thats what makes it so scary, in todays world, a plane load of schoolboys stranded on a island would do much, much worse to each other for survival and control"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of those I wish I'd read earlier in life - but there it was on vacation with me and I couldn't put it down.

The entire story - from the plane going down through the attempts to establish \\"civilization\\" & order on the island - to the devolvement of everything human - the language is compelling and transitions effective. The love and the hate between the two lead boys - Ralph & Jack - is stunning and believable. And everything related to Simon pulled hard on my heart. I loved this book - and so went out and picked up another Golding book to ready."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a very interesting book. This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you. If not the I dont think that this book is for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I, like many people, was forced to read this book for English class. This book became more of a want to read, than a have to read. The symbolism of anarchy and deterioration are developed gracefully throughout this novel. While, it does become a bit crude and a bit morose but that only serves to push foward the message of deterioration under anarchy. This is definitely a great message to get across!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A plane full of schoolkids crashes on an island.

It's certainly not \\"Moby Dick.\\" This book is violent and sudden (and gorgeously written) and asks many deep questions you may not be able to answer.What would you do to survive?What's your breaking point?What are you really like?It's an amazing and terrifying novel about the loss of innocence, about growing up in insane and scary world, and about the darkest parts of all of us.Read it, scare yourself, squirm in fear.Taste the suspense, feel the terror, and try to ignore the author's occasional, almost loving descriptions of the buttocks and body parts of young boys. Some British authors just seem to like to throw those in once in a while. I'm not sure why; it's weird."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's Lord of the Flies is so brilliant because it manages to succeed on two separate levels of writing and tell two completely different tales at the same time. The first way to look at Lord of the Flies is to view it as a dark adventure story about shipwrecked young boys struggling to survive on an island in hopes that help will find them. If Lord of the Flies was only about this idea it still would be a very good novel, but like all the great novels of the century, Lord of the Files takes us beyond a simple tale of adventure in to a symbolic, surrealistic parable dealing with the inner world of the human condition.The story, on its surface is very simple. A ship is wrecked and many young British schoolboys are abandoned on an unknown island, far away from any adults. The main characters come off as realistic, never over the top, but completely grounded and hold true to form throughout the novel, even if they do change and evil envelopes some of them.We have Ralph, most likely the main character of the book. He is the protagonist, but a deeply flawed individual. He has spasms of pride, anger, and fear, but he seems to be the most in control of himself. He is, at first elected chief of the island, but soon social order breaks down and chaos emerges. Jack is our antagonist, but it is a slow regression. At first, Jack is likable enough, but because of his pride and jealously, it ultimately leads into his dissention down to evil. Jack becomes the leader of another tribe of boys, basically Golding uses these to boys to separate good and evil. There are other vital characters as well. Simon is a confused and good spirited child, but eventually stress overtakes him and he begins to hallucinate and lose his mind. Tragedy also strikes him in one of the most eerie scenes in the novel. We also have Roger, who seems almost sinister from the get go. Golding uses words to symbolically describe Roger and the negative influence he will have as the novel progresses. Finally, we have Piggy. He is your typical outsider. Piggy is a boy that a school class would make fun of. He wears glasses, but is outspoken instead of withdrawn, as we might typically expect from people similar to him. He is one of the most complex, intelligent characters in the book, even if his backbone is not sturdy. There are other characters in the story, but these five are the anchors.Lord of the Flies is not so much concerned with story as it is with symbol and its characters. The story really doesn't exist. The boys get stranded, fight over who should be king, hunt for food, try to survive, and eventually cave and crumble under the stress of the situation they are in. The boys act and think a bit old for their age, but that is expected in a parable such as this. I don't believe Lord of the Flies was written mainly for plot and story, but to expose the idea of humans left to their own devices with ultimately result back to being carnal and evil without a proper environment to shape them. Although this is the main idea, I believe, Golding is smart enough to let us know that this is not the condition that ultimately will happen to humans left on their own, but rather what could happen. Otherwise, why would we still have characters in the book that never do result to being carnal and evil, such as Ralph and Piggy?There are many things to admire in Lord of the Flies. One is its hypnotic, descriptive imagery. One reads this novel more like a dream, a nightmare, than a straightforward tale. There are multiple references to the heat, the sun, and the cliffs, all which serve as underlying symbols. Apart from that, the struggles described here concerning the boys are astounding. One of the landmark scenes is Simon's hallucination with the talking head of a boar which foreshadows things to come. This is a completely realistic portrait of what it might be like to go insane. That is one amazing scene. The closing scenes when Ralph is running and fleeing are scary and tense, and it is hard to remember that we are dealing with just boys. There are two deaths that occur in the novel. They are graphic, painstaking, but at the same time mixed with a level of profound solitude and depth that are vacant from most novels. We feel everything going on here: the sadness, the joy, the loneliness, the fear, the isolation, the frustration. Golding does a superb job of allowing the readers to feel these emotions rather than telling them they should. Good books always do that: allow their reader to think freely and make up their own minds about ideas presented and give the reader emotions to remember. Lord of the Flies follows this pattern to perfection.People who take Lord of the Flies as just a simple adventure story are missing the big picture. This is a book that requires more than one reading. There is so much depth, so many symbols, and so many ideas about the very nature of humans it is a lot to take in, even though it is only a 200 page story. A story that reads like a dizzying nightmare, but at the same time feels so vivid and realistic. Lord of the Flies is one of the most well written, dark, frightening, and enthralling books I have ever read and I know that it will be re-read again sometime in the near future.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I actually read this book as a seventh grader and for some reason found it way beyond my comprehension skills lol. Techinally I read it as a class assignment but never actually finished reading the book if you can believe that! Well its been over 5 years since I last looked at it and decieded that it was time to finish it. And i've been happy with my decision ever since.The book is about 20 or so british children (mostly under the age of 13) who are stranded on an uncharted island with nothing but the clothes on there backs. There plane was damaged durring a storm and basicly crashed on the island. The oldest of the survivors is the main character \\"Ralph\\" who becomes the appointed leader. Ralph's main goal is to get of the island alive. A goal that was dire to the survivors at first but over time it becomes less and less important. Ralph becomes over thrown by \\"Jack\\" another boy his age who feels that meat is more important than a fire signal. Jack's charater is sort of wild and will go to any measure to gain power over the younger boys. Jack's test of power is measured when he finially kills a pig to prove that he could do it. And as time goes on, his power to kill spreads so that anyone who defies him will be delt with or killed.The only thing that I didnt like about the book was the ending. I would have liked to know more about what happened to the boys mentally after they were rescued. Like were they able to cope with what they had become which was almost like animals. But I did like the main point of the story. Which is, to me, that anyone would do anything to survive.I loved this book so much that I read it in 2 days and I strongly suggest that you do the same. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of English boy who get marooned on an island after their plane crashes during war time. None of the adults survive so they are left there to survive on their own. One of the boys, Ralph, is quickly chosen as the chief leader of the group over the book's antagonist, Jack. At one point, while exploring the island, the kids see something they believe is a beast. Later, Jack, Roger and Ralph see something that they believe is a beast, and so, there becomes an emphasis to find out exactly what it is. The fear of the \\"beast\\" is probably one of the main issues in Golding's work, because it creates the breakdown of their ability to work towards rescue. Eventually Ralph's authority over the others diminishes, and he cannot control the malevolent tendencies of Jack, who, impatient with Ralph's ideas, eventually breaks off and forms his own \\"tribe.\\" Two of the boys, Piggy and Simon, stay loyal to Ralph while one by one the others leave Ralph's group. While Piggy is intelligent and Simon is individualistic they both have trouble enforcing leadership, and so Ralph's cause to keep the fire going becomes less and less important to the others. Jack's group gets more and more brutal and rebellious, hunting pigs and using clay to look the role of a tribe. Chaos and disorder ensue, and the brutality of individuals without rules surfaces.While this story is more symbolic than anything else, what was refreshing was Golding's ability to create well-rounded characters. Each of the main characters (Piggy, Ralph, Simon, Jack, Samneric, Roger) are depicted effectively both from the dialogue and writing style. Golding is not the type of author that is just going to come out and tell you something about a character or situation; many times you have to make up your own judgment and inferences about motives and dig for some type of meaning.What also makes this book powerful is the several poignant issues it brings up. First of all, Golding examines the issue of what it would be like to have to survive in a situation where you are surrounded by peers, where laws are not part of the society. He seems to be making a pessimistic inference about how we operate when we let chaos or fear control ourselves, rather than being rational and objective towards common goals. Some of us may have at one point thought of the idea of being stranded somewhere and how we would react: this book addresses that idea and the difficulties that arise when one or more people rebel against individuals. On the surface this book may just seem like a story about kids not getting along, but in an allegorical and symbolic sense, there is something much deeper taking root which displays the darker side of human nature in individuals.I found that this book was more meaningful and enjoyable the second time I read it. I admittedly wasn't that much into it the first time, but the parts that we a bit unclear made more sense the next time I tried reading. If you can get past some of the British slang and keep pushing yourself, the book's second half is well worth it, especially Simon's experience with the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book still haunts me after reading it a year ago. I just need to look at the cover to get shivers down my spine. Lord of the Flies is a horrifying piece of fiction about how cruel, hideous, even, no, especially, murderous a group of boys could become, left deserted on a desert island with no one to trust but each other, no resourses but the island, and no adults in sight. This is not a flurry little kid's book with a morel about a happy band of friends and their adventures on a desert island. It is about young boys with real feelings, real emotions, real fears. It is about a bullying scenario that goes majorly overboard. And it is about choices, which is more important, to be safe or to insure the safety of others, to follow the crowd of bullying, brutal persons, or to stand up, even if standing up could cost you your life.In &lt;Lord of the Flies>, as I've already said, a large number of boys end up on a desert island after a plane crash. You never find out where or why they were going, which leaves it free for you to imagine. Ralf, a determined boy, though by no means perfect as he has the tendensy to bully a fat boy whom he christened 'Piggy', takes leadership. At first all goes well, apart from squabbles over leadership with Jack, a tyranising boy with a thirst to kill. Then the boys decide to light a fire to attract the attention of boats on the ocean that could rescue them and one boy of about five years disapeers. Was he burned to death by the uncontrolable fire? He was never found. It only went down-hill from there. All of the boys but Simon, my favourite character, refused to help make shelters. Jack and his choirboys went on mad hunts in the hopes to catch a wild pig. When they finally did they impaled its head on a stick and began to worship it. Simon could hear it talk to him and slowly began to go insane. The younger children were afraid of a 'monster' which one is lead to believe was really a lost, dying parachuter. That's when the total choas and brutality of the boys imerges. They divide into two groups, Jack's and Ralph's. Jack's group steals Piggie's glasses to create imense fires. They sharpen spears for the kill and create death machines out of boulders. And their target is Ralph.Lord of the Flies will haunt you with its beautiful writing, disturbing plot, and terrible reality until the end. When I finished it I was sobbing. But if you are ready to step into a rolercoaster ride of fear, wildness, and action, step aboard."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We've just recently read this book at my middle school some of my classmates and I found this book to be unappealing. I thought it was actually a boring book even considering all of the violence. In my opinion, Golding picked a subject for each chapter and dwelt on it. I thought that this was a slow-moving book. Also the way he wrote things was kind of \\"beating around the bush.\\" So my advice to you is if you do not have to read this book, don't."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The simple, yet thrilling message of William Golding's epic tale,\\"Lord of the Flies\\" reminds us of the real savages inside all human beings.

Ralph,then following the exploration of the island and the discovery of water is appointed the leader over the boys. Jack, another important character in this book who has lost the election to be leader agrees to meetings notified with the conch shell which now has a hole in in it to blow and make a signal.But as time passes the boys by real instinct kick in to answer the question \\" How and what will you do to survive your stayon the island?\\". By which then the boys split into two groups. Hunters, who live for the excitement in their lives to bring food and feed themselves to survive. Or the cilvilized boys who will keep trying to keep calm with hope of being rescued. Which will you decide to join?Lord of the Flies is a suspensful novel with the reckonization of your real behavior. In this situation, the novel test you with mini- situations the boys go through enough to ask yourself, \\"What would've I done?\\". With an unexpected ending to all events to book also with it's expected events this book is reccommended for ages 12+. But, if you want a thrill-ride of excitement, but a scenario of critical proportion, Lord of the Flies is a great book you should read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Stranded on a island with no food,water, or shelter, there's absolutley no chance of getting rescued, and to top it all off, fighting a neverending battle with the beast within. These are just a few thingd those boys had to deal with. Watching them struggle, seeing what they would do just to survive, just reading these words that William Golding wrote with such intentsity,taught me many things about life as well as myself that no one else could.The way the book Lord of the Flies was written is extremely amazing!!! Golding has so much talent, hardly anyone can compete. Out of all his good writting qualities, I believe that allusion and symbolism are the best. It's just how he finds ways to expressthe charectos anger and frustration, relating them to biblical allusions is truly amazing.you just never know what to expect. On page could be filled with life and happinessand the next could be up to the top with death and misery.I believe Golding wrote this novel to warn us that evolution is not what it seems to be. There is some one living in us all, in the deepest, darkest corner of our minds called anger. Otherwise known as the beast. He is trying to tell us that we never what to expect. We don't even know what lies ahead. He is trying to tell us expect to unexpected. The future is a dark and distant thing.In critiquing the book, first I would add a little more detail.Maybe adding a little more conflict between Jack and Ralph might interest the reader to continue,instead of tossing the book aside. Secondly I would change the ending around. Gosh! How could it end that way. Ssssshhhhh, I can't tell you anymore, okay?You will just have to read it to find out what happens.It is byfare the best book I have read in my life!! I give it five flies( flies are equivelent to stars).I would like to congradulate William Golding in writting this book that has touched us and has chnged my life and hopefully yours too forever."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I fisrt heard of the story and of the ideabehind this book, I thought it could really be agreat novel. The main idea is to propose a metaphor of what our societies are like, but from the point of view of children lost on a desert island. They &quot;build&quot; their own little society, with a chief and people who have to do some tasks if they want to survive. Well, the setting sounds really cool, doesn't it?That's why I wanted to read this book, and I was not compelled to read it by one of my teachers. But when I finished it, I was very disappointed. The basic idea is great, but the way it is developed is flawed. You just have kids who go crzay and wild because there are no more adults above them to tell them what to do or not. And moreover, when trying to show us a bit of what is our history, and an insight into the development of our civilizations, Golding forget many very important things along the way.As a matter of fact, there are no women on the island (or, well, no little girl to fall in love with). And thus, no Queen to fight for. Another example : no power behind the throne. It's just a story about survival, fisrt against Nature, and then of course against humankind (here, other children).I think that's why on one hand I loved this book, because of the setting, the ideas, and also the story. But on the other hand, this work is only a draft, not really complete and definitive (ok, no work is definitive, if you see what I mean). Sometimes when I read a book, I feel that it is the _ultimate_ novel about a subject, and I felt that for _The old mand and the sea_ (Hemingway) or _The Plague_ (Camus). This book is a good one, worth reading, but I'm sure someone can write a far better novel on this topic, and that's why I think it only deserves a 6 rating."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You may be wondering why there are such drastic variations in the reviews of this book. One reason that so many hate it, as another reviewer pointed out, is that many were forced to read it at school which most definately would put a damper on their enthusiasm. Another is the different ways in which people approached it. Some came into it expecting a Swiss Family Robinson or Hatchet type book, in which a group of boys in a plane crash struggle to survive. Many of these readers were probably appalled at much of the symbolism and Golding's strange style of writing. Those of us who came at it expecting this type of literature were drawn into the book. If you are the first type of reader, I would not recommend this book, but if you are the latter and haven't read it yet, read it now! I am not going to go too far into my own interpretations of this book, but I am going to say it is one of the best pices of writing I have ever read. Golding puts you on this island with the boys (in my opinion I don't think you are supposed to question what happened before the plane crash or how they got there. it is irrelevant and the author doesn't give much information on it, much to the frustration of some readers) and they start out much as you would expect them to. One boy takes command and they build their shelters, gather food, all of the things you are supposed to do in this situation. But then things go terribly, terribly wrong and the dark side, the Id as Freud might have called it, comes to the surface and the boys become horrible savages, and you are shocked to see the children's innocent exterior melt away. And then, at the gut-wrenching climax, they are suddenly seen again from an adult's eyes for what they really are.

What is the stigma attached to this book that some many are disturbed to the point that they would shun it as Huckleberry Finn (though that's another story)? It provides perhaps the most verisimilar (and concomitantly terrifying) inscape into the innate nature of human beings. Author of this masterpiece, Richard Golding, a Nobel Laureate, advocates atavism, expounding that people are perhaps intrinsically imperfect and moreover dangerous. The veneer of English etiquette and polite mores eroded in attrition, a group of boys stranded in a plane crash devolve, their true truculence evinced, the primal potential of all manifest in their actions.^M Furthermore Golding masterully implements symbolism on many levels, handling mutliple allegories within the macrocosm of the world and the microcosm of the island, and yet He hews this imminent, immanent, threatening eminent imbroglio into a wonderful web of fantastic connections, so that all is one. There is no superfluity in this work. All is essential, all is exigent, and all is effective, entirely unfettered from tautology, redundance, or any kind of pretention (which is far more than can be said of this deplorable &quot;review&quot;). Rarely live such authors of Golding's caliber. Even less often is such an important, demanding novel produced. Reading it is requisite, particularly if We remain blind enough to ignore its painfully blatant manifestation in reality, today, yesterday, and fearfully tomorrow.

In the story, Ralph, Piggy, Sam n Eric, Simon, and many other boys are stranded on an island by a plane crash during World War III. All adults are killed in the crash, leaving the boys alone, and unsure of what to do. At first, the boys enjoy a seeming utopia in their 'new world' but soon find that the thin veneer of humanity wears away very quickly. Ralph assumes leadership, and struggles to protect his 'tribe' from internal contention and help the younger children of the group to rid their fear of the &quot;beasties&quot; that plauge them. Each boy, from the analogical point of view, plays a part of a miniature world in their new society. Through their interactions and reactions, we see how conformity, complascence, and love work together. Soon though, after the chivalry is quenched with the ritual murdering of the Christ-figure, Simon, dissension occurs that leads the boys to break into two groups. Then the boys engage in fierce battles and huntings of each other to wipe out the other group. More killings ensue, and finally, the appearance of a ship on the island, and the captain on the beach shows what the boys are...merely boys with sticks and stones, as if it was all a game.All in all, Golding uses the microcosm to his advantage by utilizing Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. That man must first secure food, air, and shelter before he can find safetly and love respectively. Once, however, the availablity of food and shelter declines, Golding shows us how quickly chivalry in society can deteriorate, leaving our bestial selves showing through the translucent outer covering of kindness and unselfishness. Truly a masterpiece in its own right, as well as a guide. Will you heed its warnings?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Sir William Golding wrote the wonderful novel THE LORD OF THE FLIES in 1954. It is a chillingly true look at the darkest of human nature. To the casual reader, it may seem just to be an adventure of lost boys. However, it has a darker and more sinister commentary on the nature of man. If you enjoy grand and classic literature, buy Sir William Golding's THE LORD OF THE FLIES today.The novel centres around four boys among several stranded on a presumably Pacific island. Each one is symbolic of a different aspect of human nature. In the beginning, each is still bound by societal limits. As time progresses, things turn for the worst as these limits melt away. Golding masterfully shows this waring away of society, one of the novel's finer points. One of the novel's flaws is that is tedious at many points. Otherwise, it is a grand novel.If you enjoy classic literature, you should read this novel. If you enjoy thought-provoking work, read this novel. If you enjoy a highly pessimistic commentary on man's nature, read the book.

In the end, everyone in the book did what made them happy, even if it didn't work for the group. Our world today is much like this, people are mostly concerned about themselves.

I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a worthwhile book that could have used an editor with just a little more aggressiveness. The first hundred ninety-nine pages are excellent. Golding has wonderful insight into the human condition, and he applies it with rare grace and tact. And then we get to the final page, which would be best ripped out. It's impossible to go into detail without spoilers, so suffice to say this novel's ending is the single largest letdown in all of literature. Disappointing enough to knock a full star and a half off the rating. ***"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a well-written book. I will admit that. But it was boring for most of the book. SO you think I contradicted myself? Okay, it's well written in a sense that it has good language use, and lots of symbols (I seemed to like it more after we talked about it in class for English), but when I was reading it on my own over the summer, I thought it was EXTREMELY boring, and I could not concentrate and would have to read chapters again and again because it was one of those books that your eyes are reading but your brain isn't absorbing. It only got interesting until (sorry to spoil it), but when people start killing each other, and that was about chapter 10 (out of 12).THIS BOOK was rather DULL but if you like symbols and such then read it for the sake of that, but NOT for ENTERTAINMENT purposes."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the innocent childhood of boys, the difference between savagery and society need to not only be learned but used. In the parallels of adulthood and childhood mistakes must be made, which shows the other side of humanity. Boys' contemplation of adults often differ from their intellect but change to their natural instinct. When intellect fails and is replaced by instinct, survival gets lost in the fray of primal needs of power and the hunt.In this book, intellect struggles to survive amongst the power of instinct. The decision of survival can last only as long as the next idea pierces the thought of those who have any power. This theory proves why those chosen to rule must make decisions carefully, even if he needs to rob the use from a born leader. In this book reason turns into overreaction. The lesser people can still instigate fear among the powerful; an example of overreaction this book has to present. The largest problem is that overreaction has consequences. From fear comes destabilization. Once destabilization comes, uprising follows.This book shows how conspiracies children think up can show in even the most civilized society in this era. Dissent is common. This book proves that responsibility can be found only among the responsible, and when left to rule the irresponsible make mistakes. If modern society discarded religion, law, technology, and sophistication, what would happen? Would we soon find reason among instinct? No. We are animals; as are every living creature on this planet, and we would act accordingly. Our primal instinct would guide us through another period of time until reason is found and right is separated from wrong.If we were to go back to a primal state would we be allowed to call ourselves superior to other men? If law is not upheld than man is nothing more than an animal. William Golding probably made this book to enlighten the human race that primal instinct does eventually override every natural human sense.After a plane full of English children falls onto an uninhabited island two boys rally the children by blowing into a conch shell, making a harsh note that the other kids investigate. After a short assembly the boy who found the conch, Ralph, is chosen to be chief, over Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir. Ralph decides to make Jack and his choir the hunting committee. He did not see the mistake in this. Ralph naturally would be a rebel, because of his natural leadership.They decide upon a few hunters to maintain a fire so they could signal for a ship or plane to see so they could be rescued. A few days after, the primal instinct takes over ensnaring the bored, scared, unruly, and senseless into a need for the hunt and envy for fresh meat. Almost the only thing the hunters talk about is their own personal lusts of blood. This lust soon carries the hunters to hunt, leaving the fire to flicker out of existence. This was a huge loss because as the fire died a boat passed by and left no one but the hunters to blame that they would not be rescued. After a short shouting match, the tides turn leaving Jack and Ralph to become enemies. Days later Jack becomes unruly and says that he should replace Ralph as chief. The tribes yearn for the hunt and want to become savages and use their primal instinct, but obediently the people vote in favor of Ralph, further angering the already angry Jack causing him to leave to create his own tribe.A few hours pass and Ralph soon realizes that some people are missing. They take Jack's words to mind and know that the boys have left to join the other tribe. Soon more people leave and he realizes the only ones left in his tribe are Sam, Eric, Piggy, and himself. He knows that not much can be hoped for in the passing dawn and he prepares himself for an eternity on this island. They have too few people to maintain the fire and that means they can't be rescued. He looks on to what his future will be and remains uncertain.You'll have to read the book to know what happens next. This is an amazingly philosophical book. This outstanding book needs some time to really understand but I found, and hope you will find reason in this book which may compel you to enjoy it as it did for me. I find this book interesting and enjoyable, which is why I rate it a 4.4. If you find interest in intellectual writing you may decide to read this book as I did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading this book, I think William Golding is a sick, sick man. The book portrays small boys as savages trying to kill each other. Some might find it entertaining, but I find it downright disturbing. I only read it because it was required for school, but I wish I'd burned it instead."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a horrible audio book, read by the author. He offered an engaging prologue, but the reading of the book was just awful. The author was monotone, sighed while reading, and in general, sounded bored with the book. His reading does a disservice to the excellent story that he crafted."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you want to read the inspiration for this book (i.e., the sorce from which it's central concept was copied) readA High Wind in Jamaica (New York Review Books Classics). It is a far better book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Files, the story of a group of young boys, Ralph, Jack, Piggy, SamNEric Roger and others crash landed on an island with no adults. The book was good but even though it is a classic it was not great in my mind. One of the big things that I feel makes this book a classic is that the story is susposed have underlying meanings and what happens on the island is a reflection of human nature with philosophical implications etc. I honestly wouldn't have figured it all out if I hadn't read the notes at the end but after having read these it made since. It didn't take away from the story not having realized the underlying things.The Good: The characters were fairly well defined and even though there were quite a few on the island only the key figures were focused on. You forget how cruel kids can be and are reminded when you read this. Their ignorance is made clear (as is always the case when around kids) which made them real. I would actually find myself getting frustrated along with Ralph while he is trying to manage a group of kids who he cant get to listen.The Bad: Nothing really. At times the story seemed a little slow. It seem kind of hard to believe since it's only about 200 pages but it was.Overall not bad but not great either. I think to much credit is given to the intertwining of his underlying ideals. If a story is trying to prove a point that's fine but you cant take away from a story in order to wrap it around the ideal. I base my ratings on how enjoyable the book is to read instead of how much a literary gem it is considered to be. It is worth giving a read though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We have to read this book in my seventh grade class and although it is interesting I find it way below my reading leel. Keep in mind I read way above grade level. I could have been done with this book long ago if I got more than 10 min reading time. OH Well. Great survival book. Stick with it. It gets more interesting towards the end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book had alot more depth in it than is written on the pages. It was really good the way Golding maded it a smaller version of the world. and the way he analized it all into just a little island. I think its a good way to look at the world and the way we dont see these types of things in ourselfs. So Golding did a good job on minimzing it and showing us the way we act without even realizing it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i enjoyed reading this novel. It makes you realize the factors of life. It also make you really think about how young boys think. One thing i liked about the story was the amazing narrating job Golding did. He describes every single detail so we get the full effect of the story. I didnt like how the story was so pessimistic. With all the killing that went on it made the vibe of the novel negative. I encourage anyone to read this book if you like a complicating story that really makes you think what you would do in that kind of situation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think this book was a very boring book but on the other hand it was very interesting to see what william golding thought about \\"human nature\\". After i read this book i started realizing that in some books you have to look deeper than what it says. What everything means.

Everything had its place that fit."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the book,Lord Of The Flies, was a pretty good book.There were a few things that I thought were very gross.But I thought about the way my brother acts and then I thouoght about how true it was.I disliked the way they killed piggy just because he couldn't see.I like the way Ralph treats everyone with respect.I think the book was very wild and very fantastic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this book, william golding puts forth his veiw of mans instinctive nature.

Theres nothing i dislike about the book at all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has been widely discussed and read, regarded as classic and worth of a Nobel Prize for William Golding. For some reason I had my reserves about it, I do with most \\"classics\\", but I decided to read it anyway. Even though is haunting and beautifully written; I was left with the feeling that this was just a novel of kids stranded on a desert island that could have been much better. And most of the critic to human nature and society is just a lot of hype."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of those classic books that many read in middle school; however, if you do not get the chance too then, well, grab it now.When an accident of some kind leaves a group of young British boys stranded on an island, they must find a way to survive. Yet this book is more then just a book of Crusoe survival. In fact, this could be Golding's sociological view of youth when tested. Of course, this is solely fiction.Either way though, this story of cohesion and division can touch one, but then it can also frighten. Now whether that skill is attributed to the plot or Golding's writing is debatable, although it's probably both.Like I said though, this is a classic for all, espesically the middle-schooler."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for English Class. Most people don't get the point of this book. Put simply... it's about what happens when there is no leadership. It's a great book. If you haven't read it, read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read Lord of the Flies for a class report a few weeks ago. Despite all of the bad reviews from others who had to read the book in high school, I didn't believe it was that bad. Yes, it was a bit over-descriptive, but many famous works are the same way. It is the only way for the author to help visualize the scenery. Some complain that it was confusing and jumped around too much, this isn't true in any way. One good point made earlier was the lack of reality. Children don't become savages in a matter of weeks, it would take at least a year. Overall, I would have to rate this book 4 stars due to lack of reality."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies adds a fresh perspective and new insight to philosophy's age-old discourse on the constant war between the rational and the physical. Hauntingly, Golding's prediction for 20th century adolescents, left to their own unsupervised (and uncivilized) self-determination applies to society at large as well as the individual. As Golding addresses the passionate struggles that are played out on the island and within the minds of the main characters, he challenges his audience to reflect on their own human nature as they try to identify with any of the characters--none of whom are overly endearing.Would I honestly be strong enough to stand alone against a group of peers, or would I too get caught up in the excitement of the anarchy and surrender to the thrill of the hunt. What would you do?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a very realistic book, this is probably be what society would be like with no laws or restraints. The violence, panicking, and irresponsibility. It can be disturbing, but I'm glad I read it. The hunters sometimes are so obsessed with killing and blood, they take things too far. This book is NOT for the squeamish, but I recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A great book. It is full of many suttle metaphores and a lot of action. I highly recomend it. Buy it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read, not only in school as a set text. We were so lucky to have decent books like this and 'Mockingbird' instead of the usual boring books with romantic storylines. William Golding is a true genius!! And he gets all of my respect. The story of the boys on the island is so sad and yet so true to life, and human nature. The tragedy is definately when Piggy dies. He was so intelligent and yet so unaccustomed to human ways and the real world. It was so sad. And I'm so glad that those left were found in the end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel has an interesting view of human nature and its primal tendancies. The quality of writing and imagery is masked a little by over-usage of detail statements. The characters are complex and interesting, but the story could be told equally as effectively in 125 pages as it was in 202. In short: good book, worth buying."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This story is about a bunch of kids who get marooned on an island. There is only a few smart people, of course, and the rest savages. The book shows what will happen to a bunch of kids who have to strive for themselves. They thus form a government and it of course crashes. The kids are much too selfish to put up a fire signal to get help, thus they hunt and try to act like men in a true tribe. Yet all along, the lord who never actually apears, only once in an illusion, watches them: observes them, and acts as their silent wathcer, like their Lord. I give this book five stars becuase it pretty much shows how kids try to live on their own and what sinisterism they can obtain by living without authoirty."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really liked this book.

I know Golding used many symbolisms in this book. I guess I'm not much of a symbolism guy therefore, I didn't see much of the interesting points.

This book isnt for someone who doesn't like or recognize symbolism (like me)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm currently reading this book as required reading for next years English class. I'm about half way through and so far, I'm having to force myself to pick it up and continue reading. The plot is sometimes hard to understand and the dialouge is hard to follow. There are often places where there is no indication as to who is saying what. I also find the beginning a little confusing. I know that the plane was shot down but WHY? Was it an accident or was it on purpose? The book is good, I guess, but you really have to WANT to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am curious to know how old you were when you've read the book, &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD TO BE QUITE FRANK IT WAS DISTURBING BUT VERY GOOD I GIVE IT 5 STARS ALL THE WAY IT IS A COMPLEAT MASTERPIECE EVEN IF NOT FOR BED TIME."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The first book Golding wrote and the only book he wrote considered anywhere near classic level. I think the things people have come up with as symbolism in this book are absurb. Comparisons to Conrad should not be taken seriously. I think it has more of the aspects of a political novel. It pokes fun at how democracy's choose their leader and at fascist governments, tyrants, and at pagan rulers. This novel also shows the humans need of some type of spiritual beliefs. Golding intended this as both a slightly symbloic novel and an adventure story. The happy ending is a testament to that. Clearly not deserving of a spot in the top 100 books of the century (at least not in the top 20) it is still a good effort by golding and a book for lovers of implied ideas. The poor plot and impossible keeps it from being great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the best books i have ever read it is well written and exicitin"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On the surface, Lord of the Flies looks like a normal adventure story about young boys. Yet when one further delves into the novel and reachs its core, one relaizes the true intent of Lord of the Flies. It paints a portrait of the slow dissintegration of a reckless society. At first,the society of grade-school boys had assemblies, discussed their plans in a responsible manner, and formed a cycle of getting things done on the deserted island. Yet the gradual destruction of the society showed by the symbolism of Piggy's glasses slowly crumbling.Lord of the Flies shows how the absence of rational thinking leads to an apocalyptic end. Read this novel, and brace yourself for an exploration of horror, pain, and the dissapearnce of hope and logic. Read in between the lines to find the true literal magic of Golding's work."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You can find in this book all about human nature, everything about the good and the evil. You can also take it like a book of history, and learn of it esential things for life."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I believe that it is the very stule with which Golding writes that captures the reader's attention. The book has a very curious nature which draws the reader inside of the characters' heads, forcing them to feel the boys' pain, suffiering, joy and fear. Each chapter is open-ended and seemingly meaningless until the final chapters pull the whole story together with a gripping climax and astounding finish. I reccommend this book to anyone who is a patient reader and like spooky, mysterious, chilling stories."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading Lord of the Flies, I was very disturbed at what had happen to the young kids on the island. They went through so much physically and mentally. I liked the fact that Golding used children as the strugglers and survivors. It just shows how so many things in the outside world can influence a young person's mind. I was especially attracted to Ralph who wanted to set order and maintain hope of being rescued. At the end he was able to realize that what he wanted could never happen because of what was lost in each child on the island, innocence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Contrary to what many school systems believe, this is not a book for children. Although it may be simple to read, it is complex, difficult, and harrowing to understand. From a language standpoint, it is rich in symbolism and imagery, but more importantly, from a literary standpoint, it is a poignant story of the world's problems and the natural instincts of man. There are many Biblical allusions in the novel, but there are also an abundance of allusions to real-world, relevant problems."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding was an excellent book that can be read on multiple levels--literal, symbolical, and political. This novel really made one think about events and people in this world. For instance, Piggy and Raplph are symbolic representations of abstract things in life. After reading Catcher in the Rye, this book was very good. This book offers much to the reader and to a twentieth century world where genocide and world wide destruction is possible. Excellent read for anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is my favorite book yet (and by the way, I've read quite a few.) Not only is the symbolism masterful, but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well. I am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions. I honestly can't figure how anyone could find fault with it. I understand that it's not the most enjoyable of experiences to &quot;read books for school,&quot; but this one is not one of the &quot;boring&quot; kind. The book is beautifully written and Golding's use of metaphor, allegory, and personification is consummate. Golding pulls all he can into this book, details from all walks of life. The book is incredible, as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot, as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness. All you have to do is read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Hey, reader from St. Louis: I don't think so. Yeah, forget Lord of the Flies -- just read Into Thin Air! Are you kidding? This is one of the greatest works of the 20th century. While you are at it, why not read some Danielle Steele -- it's better than this Golding garbage!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is alright I guess. I mean, I know it's a classic, but the plot is distinctly lacking in so many ways, you feel like it should be updated for today's readers. For instance, there are no touchscreen interfaces OF ANY KIND in this book. Nobody has a camelback or even an earth-friendly stainless steel water bottle. And unless I'm forgetting something, there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know, I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions? Because as it is, there's really not much to it except a searing journey into mostly unanswerable questions about what it is to be human."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This audio CD had me excited at first, at least until I actually played it. It's the most boring read of any story I've ever heard in my life. Golding's a great writer, but he ain't no reader. His own commentary in parts is distracting and irritating. His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit. Too bad an accomplished reader such as Roger Dressler or Garrick Hagon can't do this novel justice. It's just a damned shame is all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have seen several reviews in here that say this book was boring; It wasn't boring, it was nasty! Several people also said it wasn't for people under thirteen. Well, I'm twelve, and I read mostly adult books, so it's not like I didn't understand it. It's just that I hated it! Yes, I admit, there is evil lurking inside everyone, I know. But I find it hard to admit that it could be quiet as much as Mister Golding portrays. There are also some nice little descriptions about a bunch of savage boys dying very painful deaths, and I wonder why anyone would title their book after a pig's head speared on a stick. ??????? In my opinion, if you haven't read this book, dont' touch it, unless you want to have your fingers tainted forever."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book starts out pretty quickly, and anyone reading it could probably catch on pretty quickly. There has been a plane crash, and the only survivors are a number of British boys ages 4 to about 14. Soon after they realize that they are on an uninhabited island, and that they must rely on themselves to survive and to get rescued. Upon arriving at the island, they have a group meeting, and when Ralph is voted chief of the island, Jack is left as an also-ran. That's something what I liked about this novel, the whole idea of children being captive on an island, living of pigs and fruit, and trying to maintain a civilization with order and authority all by themselves.However, I am surprised that I actually finished this book. This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so 'absolutely intellectual to the highest extent'. From the looks of it, I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major, then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event, to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings, it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hated this book! It was full of blunt, unequivocal sybolism. I think that is one of the major problems; every few sentences you discover a new oddity that is supposed to directly link itself to the majority of underlying human disposition. However, I found that most of these allegories just didn't quite manifest as true on the whole. Golding has taken simple facts and drastically over-exaggerated them. My second point is that the characters seem underdeveloped and because of this I found myself wishing they would all die off and then just maybe a more interesting story could arise. Perhaps I had more trouble relating than others might because of the fact that i am not living in the time period of the book and that all of the characters were boys younger than myself. You see, I am in 10th grade and had to read this book last year for my english class (and by the way I read many, many books in my spare time). I found all of the main personae in this book caustically unlikable (as I said before I found myself wishing they were all dead). I also think it is sad that this book is so repetitive, through the whole book the troupe was splitting... then there was one, well the rest couldn't have that so they try to kill him and aside from actually saying who went with which group and when and why, the boys' monologue seemed to be 'what is the other tribe doing?', 'what will we eat tonight?', 'when and how can we be rescued?', etcetera. This did not fit well with the consistent symbolism and was not very well integrated into the story. Ok, well, all grumbling aside, the last two chapters were at very least full of action but of course i was dissapointed that they didn't all perish in the end of the book. I suppose though to each thier own, because this is definitely a love it/ hate it type of book. I do not recommend this to anyone who likes to relate to books in any way, but if you must read it at least it is fairly short..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure, Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure, but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this clich&eacute;-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic, and because of this common subject matter, a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Perhaps it is because of my age, I'm nearing 23, that I find this work so, to quote someone from the board, atrocious.This book is absolutely boring and hadn't it been for my friend's reference, I would not have bought iT!!! The setting is an island; the cast is a bunch of stranded 6 to 13 year olds. The major characters are Jack Merridew (the bully), Piggy (the dweeb) and Ralph (The chief and someone in between).Lord of the Flies is a journey of civilised minds turning savage. Everything starts off hunky dory as the children realise they have the whole island to themselves and that no adult is there to govern their behaviour. Everything begins in a civil manner: a leader is chosen (Ralph), the hunters are elected (Jack is the leader of the hunters) and priorities are set (that of making smoke so that nearby ships may spot them, and obtaining meat).Of course, these are nascent minds deprived of a social structure, technology and a family system and so they eventually succumb to savagery.This could have been a fantastic psychological story; one that I feel could have attracted a reader from any generation. Unfortunately, more ink is spent on giving visual descriptions of the island and rocks and reeds than it is on the actual story. Coming to the descriptions, they are fantastic and perhaps the only feature of the novel worthy of merit, though I did think sometimes that Sir Golding should have let my imagination fill in some of the bits too.No matter how much sophistry one may use, no matter how much we may wish to incorporate Freud and Jung and whomever else, I feel the story rushed too quickly. Sir Golding did our work of visualising the island but burdened us with the responsibility of making all the important decisions regarding character developments.Take, for example, the killing of a beast/a pig. The reader was deprived of the feelings the youngsters (Jack, Roger etc) must have gone through when they were contemplating killing a beast, skinning it, stabbing it and running the sharp tools across its throat. They are children for God sake, they wouldn't just go out there and start killing. What would have driven children to kill another animal? Not much stress was placed upon hunger, the driving force behind all of this.This is just one example but the readers will find other examples too, as they go through the chapters.I feel this story could have tapped into something spectacular but with 120 thousand words...maybe not. Perhaps Sir Golding had youngsters as his target audience and so I would not come into this at all..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies showcases the idea that we are empty canasters being filled by environments and echoes the haunting statement that children are capable of immoral acts. Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.I do think, as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been, that it's an overblown, overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works, such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to, harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because, psychologically, the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand, Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have recently went through the extremely torturous chore of reading this novel in my eleventh grade English class. I hated this book so much that I went up to my teacher and told her exactly what I thought of this abysmal piece of work. Guess who wasn't too happy. I've heard so many great things about this book, so I just couldn't wait to start it. &quot;Yeah, Lord of the Flies, great!&quot; From the first page, I hated it. This book is so hard to follow. I read a page. Then I think to myself &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; I read the page again and only got a vague impression of what was going on and struggling to figure out what William Golding was trying to get across to the reader. Sure its possible to figure it out, but how can you really enjoy a novel if you have to strain your brain to be able to get the badly told story into your mind and keep it there. I disliked this book so much that I removed the cover and glued it on upside down before I gave it back to my teacher."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm a 10th grader in Salinas, CA and my summer school &quot;Puente Program&quot; is having a good time reading Lord of the Flies.

It is about a group of boys who land on a desserted island after their plane has crashed. No adults had survived the plane wreck, so the kids are without any adult supervision. Throughout the book the children learn to survive on their own by hunting pigs, and building shelters, with Ralph as their leader. But they cannot all get along, and when Jack starts his own hunting tribe the group of boys split. The boys in Jack's group always wanting to hunt, quickly turn into fierce savages. So fierce that others are endangered of being killed. After most of the boys join Jack's tribe, Ralph and only a few other boys are left to try to get themselves and the others recued.This is an event filled book with a lot of action always taking place. I recomend ti anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's book, The Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting and chilling story. The plot of the story is that a group of English boys become stranded on a deserted island from a plane crash. The boys try to gather food, construct shelter, hunt, and make smoke signals for boats to rescue them. Ralph is the oldest of the boys, and he is elected chief of the group of children. Ralph tries to put responsibility in the gang of boys, so they don't just eat, play, and swim all day. Piggy is Ralph's advisor. He is a little chubby, and his \\"specs\\" come in handy to light fires as signals to passing ships. Jack is the leader of a group of face painted hunters. He becomes a large nuisance to Ralph's idea of order and responsibility. Jack lures many of the boys to hunt with him. Through this turn of events, there are no shelters being made and the signal fire is not being tended to. Everyone is just hunting pigs all day. This fall of Ralph's plan becomes a large problem, and Ralph realizes that instead of being a hunter, he is the one being hunted."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a rare book that feally makes you think. I'm 13 years old and I loved this book. It's extreemly disturbing and that's why I loved it. That little 7th grader who thought it was sick obviously is too young or not ready for this book. FOR MATURE READERS ONLY."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was probably one of the most interesting books I have read in awhile. The characters were probably the most interesting element in this story. There is also a very interesting conflict between Ralph and Jack. This represents the struggle between good and evil. The ending was expected but it was told in a way that left you still with a bit of surprise. The boy's British accents made it difficult to understand what they meant at times but for the most part, it was fairly easy reading. I recommend this book to anyone especially to males because I think you can relate to the characters more then girls can."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the author's purpose is to show the nature of humans under tough conditions. Yes, I agree with the author's message because this is something that could really happen and I think everyone should read this book. The literary element that I think the author handled best is Characters. I like the way Golding describes the characters. I don't think the book was \\"less than perfect.\\" If I had to change one thing about the book, I would change the setting and make it in a place with less things to depend on, just to see how the children would live."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think this book presents a very dark, negative side to human nature, and does so with incredible skill and vision. Every time I finish with reading it, I feel like I've just woken up from a horribly vivid nightmare. It's a great commentary on what's wrong with people, and if more people understood it, I'm sure there would be fewer bad reviews here."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There is not much i can say about this book besides that it is the greatest book ever written. We were to read it in my 10th grade english class a few weeks back, and i've read it 4 times already, outside of class. William Golding shows human's natural dark side in a beautiful way, using stunning symbolism and description, not to mention the numerous other themes of this book. If you could only read one book ever again, read Lord of the Flies. As for the people who gave this book a one star, they need to get beyond the &quot;My teacher made me read it therefore it stinks&quot; thing and look at the book for what it really is."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Far more than a story of some kids on an island...really a tale of basic human savagery. The decent from civility to savagery is stunning; indeed, the boys on the island, in seeing the human spirit for what it really is, no longer look upon the world with the typical wide-eyed innocence of youth. In fact, they weep for the world at the story's end. In short, a hugely complex and important work- a must for all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies helps you understand almost everything about humans and human nature. It seems to be a great book, although it is rather boring at the beginning of the book. But as you continue to read the boring book that you just picked up suddenly turns into an excitingly brutal story.Other than that I can't say much about the book because I have yet to finish it.You'll also see how brilliantly descriptive William Golding is."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is top stuff. It's a classic--the final sequences in Cry of the Hunters are absolutely terrifying, and the tragic and heart-felt disintigration of the boys' society which precede it wonderfully scripted. The description of the island's geographical environment is sometimes a bit hard to picture, but that doesn't detract from this being one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking and downright scary novels I've ever read. The ambivalent ending is even more effective when considered along with Stephen King's question in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;: who will save the grownups?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is strange that my facorite book was one that I had to read for English. Usually I find that books are spoiled by overanalysis in class, but two years later I continue to return to Lord of the Flies for numerous examples relating to real life. Few books have made me think as much as Lord of the Flies did. I would, and have, recommended it to anyone looking for a good read.concise but complex, easy to read and still multidimentional"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am a 14 year old hyperactive male. So as anyone would know, being hyperactive, book reading is not a favorite thing. But when I really started to understand the book I became quite intrigued. This book is based on two conflicts: Man vs. Self and Man vs. Man. It gives a great aspect of how civilization turns wild when no control is in order. It also shares two different points of views. There is more irony in this book in any that I have read (which is very few). Not many people would understand cause even I had to ask for help in understanding. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Very well written! This book makes me wanna read everything written by Mr.Golding!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is a very easy book to read on the surface.

One of the problems was that there were too many minor incidents occurring at once, such as the fire going out, Ralph and Jack arguing, and Piggy complaining about other people talking when someone has the conch. I also thought the characters didn't seem very realistic. I felt that they didn't think and act like kids in real life would. How many 15 year olds honestly think there are beasts and ghost things in the world? Overall, it was a decent book to read, but one that I would not hurry back to the library to read again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book, I have mixed feelings. The first thing that I feel towards this book is that I don't like it. I thought it was more of a boy's type book that was really hard for me to understand. I thought it was very confusing and complicated. As I continued to read the book, it began to make more sense. As you read it, you learn what the main concept is of the book. The main concept is that if you live for awhile without someone watching over you, you begin to become a savage. This is especially bad for young boys. Then I began to like the book a little bit. I liked it because it taught a valuable lesson to the readers and to the boys that were on the island. It taught them that to survive you have to work together as a team. It also teaches the readers how cruel the world can be. This is an okay book once you look at the whole picture."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book would have been interesting if I would have understood what was going on. It was very difficult to know what was going on. At points you had to decide what it meant. There were many different meanings to this book.

You never know you might like it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I't started out with a bunch of boy that were deserted on an island and starded a war.

As in Lord of the Flies, I think we all have an evil nature that has been a part of us from the day we were born, and the strength and character of a person is what tells us whether or not it will ever be revealed. Lord of the Flies shows us that no matter whether you are young or old, you can succumb to the evil that is tempting you. This is shown because the only reason the boys were on the island was becasuse of the war going on where they lived. I believe that we all need to take to heart the mesage presented by William Golding. A good example of human's evil nature in today's society is the recent school shooting out in Littleton, Colorado. Nobody will know exactly what set these boys off, but whatever it was, they didn't have the strength to overcome it. This was exactly the case with Jack and his need to kill. We all need to take responsiblity to make certain our fighting isn't the cause of children turning into savages, and we need to take responsibility in raising our children to be strong enough to overcome the temptation of evil. Overall, Lord of the Flies was a good book with a moral, and we as a nation need to take heed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have two outlooks on the book. I didn't like it because it was very complicated to understand. On the other hand the book was great when you got towards the end of the book. It really relates to society, and even though many people may not like the book, it should be read in all classes. The book pertains to society in many ways. One of which is the Colorado shooting. In the book, Jack and the hunters become savages, obsessed with killing pigs. They even killed two of their own people. The gunmen in Colorado did pretty much the same thing. Society turned on them and they turned on society. Society is a cruel world and this book proves it.Not only did I like the book because it pertains to society and &quot;reality&quot; in many ways, it became very fascinating toward the end. Jack and the hunter's killed Simon because they weren't in &quot;reality&quot;. They were focusing more on killing the pigs and the &quot;beast&quot; that they didn't realize what they were doing. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that it was great that they killed Simon, but it shows the affect the environment has on people. There's so many ways you can relate this book to society. I can't express enough that this book is great but confusing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in 7th grade and hated it. I didn't get any of what Golding was really trying to say, so I dismissed it as another boring book. Now that I've read it again, I loved it. This is a really frightening book if you understand the symbolism of the beast. It is scary because you'll then realize that anybody is capable of doing the same things that Jack and his tribe do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It was a very hard book to get into, very slow.

Maybe I am too much of an optimist but I really can't see a group of boys turning into killing machines that quickly just because they are trapped on an island. Fighting, of course; stabbing and attacking, not so much. Like I said, maybe I just think to highly of people, but this book just seemed so unrealistic to me that it lost all of the chilling effect that it is supposed to evoke.

It didn't age well. I think we need far more to shock us today and so much of the significance is lost. A great book, in its time and context, no doubt."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At first glance, this book can seem like yet another schoolboy adventure story. In truth, when read without instruction, Lord of the Flies can be boring and tedious. However, it is entirely necessary for one to look rather deeply beyond the surface in order to grasp the full meaning and depth of this tale. In fact, I wouldn't quite call this book an adventure story- it is more about pure survival. A group of English schoolboys are stranded on an island during the next world war after their plane crashes. A boy named Ralph becomes the chief, while the head choir boy, Jack, leads the group of hunters as Ralph is guided by the wisdom of the unappreciated and taunted Piggy. Also on the island is the epileptic SImon, who becomes somewhat of a mystic and becomes the first boy to truly understand the darkness that has overtaken the rest of the boys. Golding's story is fraught with metaphors and hidden messages. The entire book is a sort of allegory to Freud's makeup of the human mind, with certain boys coming to represent the Id, Ego, and Superego. Instead of becoming a fun, parent-free island, the boys are overtaken by their most primitive urges (the Id) and become ruthless, killing savages, particularly Jack and his friend Roger. Only a few boys appear to retain their sanity, but then death by the boys' hands comes to the island. The story becomes a Darwinian nightmare. I was enthralled by this tale of savagery and heartlessness, and felt that Golding's representation of the darkness of man's heart was both honest and striking. It is no wonder that this book is required reading for many schools across the country."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book is about a plane crashing leaving a bunch of kids stuck on an island. They are celebrating their independence at first but after a while their chance of being rescued is slim. Day to day, they create their own laws and rules to somewhat form their own government. The moral of the book is the importance of the government and how it regulates the rules and laws.I would recommend this book because its very suspenseful and leaves you guessing. The Morals and values can relate to my life and may relate to yours too. The value of the government is often taken for granted as we don't follow the Laws/Rules. The book teaches the importance of how you should follow the laws and to not be a menace in society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a pretty good book. I liked how Golding put all of it together. He did a good job with all of the symbols. I don't know how anybody could come up with all of it. I especially enjoyed the major symbolism of good vs. evil (Ralph vs. Jack). I do think it would have been better if Golding made some of them cannibals."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"English 9In Lord of the Flies the Author William golding shows characters have astruggle for existence.

I thought it was a very good book. The author did a good job of making you feel like you were actually there with characters. I don't really like to read but with this book I was able to get into it and finish the book.The novel the Lord Of the Flies was about a bunch of kids that are flying across an island during a war. Then the plane had been shot down. The kids end up landing on an abandoned island. As they hit the island they all get separated. Then a little bit in to the book they had all found each other and they decided to make a type of government to keep control on the island. Now as they go on in the book you got to think that they are all kids and they don't want to live under other kids rule. So as the story goes on they all start to turn on each other and start making their own organizations. As the book starts to develop there are a lot of different symbols that you start to realize. The symbols represent a bunch of different things the book and how some of the characters act. Then the book starts to get a little violent as they start to kill each other. Towards the end of the book they have completely all gone wild and turned against each other.I thought that the book was very good. I liked the whole idea of the book. I think that it is a good book and I recommend it to anyone that likes to read. It was a short and easy to read. I liked how the author had described the book in detail. that's what made it a book good.
