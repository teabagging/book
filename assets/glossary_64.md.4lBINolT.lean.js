He shares recent extraordinary discoveries about the elephant's sophisticated family and community structure and reveals the remarkable ways in which elephants show compassion and loyalty to each other.

Prompted by hard times, farmers in Lampasas County, Texas, gathered in 1877 to discuss what could be done. From these modest origins emerged the National Farmers Alliance and Industrial Union, later known as the Southern Farmers Alliance, a powerful protest movement that played an important role in the formation in 1892 of a new political force, the People's party. In the \\"solid South,\\" particularly in Texas, large numbers of voters abandoned the Democratic party for the new party. Yet despite this support, the decline of the People's party after 1894 was swift. Farmers in Rebellion recounts the compelling story of these two crucial and closely related movements. Donna A. Barnes examines their developmental histories, asking such important questions as: Under what conditions do protest movements remain weak? Under what conditions do they prosper, amassing large numbers of supporters? And under what conditions do successful protest movements lose their momentum and die? The author explores these complex questions with deft use of archival data that allows her to reflect on the adequacy of the past sociological answers to these questions. Farmers in Rebellion is a book rich in detail and scope in its look at a critical juncture in the growth of national populist movements. Of interest to sociologists, historians, and political scientists, it stands as an important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in Texas, and national, history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jY2NBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Politics Of Meaning: Restoring Hope And Possibility In An Age Of Cynicism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kingdom of love","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"LA Vera Cucina Italiana: The Fundamentals of Classic Italian Cooking","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QnVvAAAACAAJ&dq=LA+Vera+Cucina+Italiana:+The+Fundamentals+of+Classic+Italian+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light-Source","description":"Decide Which Lighting Technology Is Best for Your ApplicationLight Sources, Second Edition: Basics of Lighting Technologies and Applications presents an overview of the three main technologies that have produced the numerous families of lighting products on the market today: electrical incandescence, electrical gas discharges, and semiconductor lig","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m90_CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"13 devils","description":"Kikuhara comes to terms with the trauma of his past.

In the early months of WWI, on Christmas Eve, men on both sides left their trenches, laid down their arms, and joined in a spontaneous celebration with their new friends, the enemy. For a brief, blissful time, remembered since in song and story, a world war stopped. Even the participants found what they were doing incredible. Germans placed candle-lit Christmas trees on trench parapets and warring soldiers sang carols. In the spirit of the season they ventured out beyond their barbed wire to meet in No Man's Land, where they buried the dead in moving ceremonies, exchanged gifts, ate and drank together, and joyously played football, often with improvised balls. The truce spread as men defied orders and fired harmlessly into the air. But, reluctantly, they were forced to re-start history's most bloody war.

S. S. Hornet and the First Year of the Pacific War","description":"The American fleet aircraft carrier Hornet is widely acknowledged for the contributions she made to the war effort. The Doolittle Raid, launched from the Hornet's deck, inaugurated America's Pacific counteroffensive and transformed the aircraft carrier into one of the world's prime strategic weapon systems. She was one of three carriers to participate in the victory at Midway and the fighting around Guadalcanal. Through the experiences of this key warship and the eyes of her crew and the aviators who flew from her deck, Lisle Rose recreates the first desperate year of the war in the Pacific. He tells how the Hornet was molded into a deadly weapon of war, how the ship was fought and ultimately lost, and what it was like to live aboard her at a time when the fate of the United States depended on the Navy's tiny carrier fleet. In chronicling the carrier's operational history, the author contends that the fate of the Hornet's air group at Midway remains one of the great controversies in modern naval history and that the ship's importance in helping to keep the Japanese juggernaut at bay during the most critical period of the Pacific war is incontestable. His arguments ring true today as the controversy continues. Rose succeeds both in letting the reader see things the way the men of the Hornet did and in placing their experiences in a broad historical context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=taeSaPXO5k8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Bowl Down: An Appalachian Rhyme","description":"Rhyming text reveals the process of preparing bread dough in the evening while the stove is still warm so that it will rise overnight, ready to bake into loaves before the family awakens the next morning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dna54Dx1LSEC&dq=Blue+Bowl+Down:+An+Appalachian+Rhyme&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Task of Old Testament Theology: Substance, Method, and Cases","description":"This prodigious work offers a broad selection of essays that present Knierim's distinct method for the discipline of Old Testament studies.

Now in this book Erickson offers his own promised in-depth analysis and constructive response. What are the intellectual roots of postmodernism? Who are its most prominent exponents? What can we learn from their critique of modernism? Where do their assumptions and analyses fail us? Where do we go from here? What might a post-postmodernism look like?

But in Lean and Green, Pamela Gordon proves that capitalism and environmentalism are not mutually exclusive-quite the contrary. She shows how \\"green\\" business practices enable organizations to save millions, even billions of dollars each year. Lean and Gree chronicles over one hundred examples of how people in twenty different organizations around the world-from clerks, farmers, and city employees to chemists and executives-have strengthened environmental practices and the balance sheet. She details waste-saving, profit-building acts as basic as Linda Gee at LSI Logic digging out usable pre-worn shoe covers to wear in the clean room, and as broad as the city of Santa Monica paving residential streets with white top to reduce urban heat and increase surface longevity. Drawing on her background as a leading business consultant, Gordon shows readers precisely how to sell their environmental ideas to management. She describes how to make the case in no-nonsense business terms, set concrete goals that the new practices will achieve, measure the economic results of the new practices, and make sure the right people hear about the results so that environmental initiatives continue. Each chapter includes a \\"Making It Easy\\" list of action steps for implementing lean and green improvements in the workplace easily and immediately. Lean and Green will inspire employees and employers alike to explore creative ways to simultaneously save the planet and bolster the bottom line.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0uzL1nC-ZxMC&dq=Lean+and+Green:+Profit+for+Your+Workplace+and+the+Environment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One day's journey","description":"An account in verse of a day's journey through part of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, via trolley and boat, by members of the T.S.C. club.

The story unfolds on a classic Krantz background, a magic carpet of gorgeous entertainment and sumptuous events. Yet, at its core, The Jewels of Tessa Kent is an engrossing, deeply moving, and ultimately inspiring tale of two women bound by blood yet torn apart by their deepest emotions. Tessa Kent, an exquisite and precocious fourteen, gives birth to an illegitimate daughter. Her parents, devout Catholics, raise the infant, Maggie, as their own child. At sixteen Tessa is discovered by Hollywood; by nineteen she's an international movie star. Maggie lives for her glorious \\"sister's\\" infrequent whirlwind visits. Maggie is a captivating, independent eighteen when she accidentally learns the truth. Mortally wounded, she breaks all ties with Tessa and starts to work at the famed Manhattan auction house of Scott & Scott. Five years later, a life-altering crisis makes Tessa passionately determined to end this estrangement. An auction is the only way she can find to reach her daughter, an auction of the immensely valuable collection of famed jewels that represent all the love lavished on her by her late husband. Tessa promises Scott & Scott the auction on the condition that Maggie and she work closely together on the sale. For Tessa, her entire future now hangs on the hope of an almost impossible reconciliation. The Jewels of Tessa Kent deals with the fascinating workings of an auction house; it's a revealing look at the inside of Hollywood stardom; but more than anything else, it's a story of feelings and family, of loss, mistakes, joy and redemption.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dcQ3QqE7RnUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Publish, Don't Perish: The Scholar's Guide to Academic Writing and Publishing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A history of New York: from the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty","description":"Told from the perspective of a cantankerous man named Deidrick Knickerbocker, A Knickerbocker s History of New York depicts a satirical history spanning from the world s creation to the end of the Dutch dynasty. Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch  rule , 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twentieth-Century Artists on Art","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Selected stories (The world's classics)","description":"Shares twelve stories starring the legendary detective, including the novel \\"The Sign of the Four,\\" in which Holmes investigates when a woman receives cryptic messages and valuable pearls after her father's sudden disappearance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uEfbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Selected+stories+(The+world%27s+classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picture Me in the Circus","description":"Picture Me \\"TM\\" Cute As Can Bee, Picture Me \\"TM\\" Grown-up, Picture Me \\"TM\\" with my Grandma, Picture Me \\"TM\\" on Santa's Knee.

A man who for decades opted to \\"give expression to the world\\" rather than to \\"express\\" himself speaks for the first and only time about his life, family, work, his theory of art and how it intersects with history, literature, and spirituality. Balthus was born Balthasar Klossowski in 1908 to Polish art historian Erich Klossowski and his wife, the painter Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro. The family lived in Germany, France, and Switzerland. In this memoir Balthus describes his childhood with his mother and her lover -- the poet Rainer Maria Rilke -- who became Balthus's own spiritual mentor. He evokes la vie de boheme in Paris during the 1920s, his friendships with Picasso, Derain, Artaud, Giacometti, Saint-Exup ry, Ren  Char, Pierre Jean Jouve, and Albert Camus. He discusses his paintings, offers glimpses into his marriage, and expresses his passion for Chinese art and the Swiss chalets and Italian villas that he helped to restore. He recalls touching moments with his beloved daughter Harumi and the inspiration he drew from his cats. Also, in a kind of final lesson, Balthus shares his thoughts about painting and creation, denounces contemporary art as being illusory and deceitful, and talks candidly about his Catholic faith and how it inspired his work. \\"We are most charmed by the memoir's ease of expression, as if Balthus were confiding in us, as individuals,\\" writes Joyce Carol Oates in her introduction to Vanished Splendors. \\"We are brought into a startling intimacy with genius.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vmHTwAEACAAJ&dq=Vanished+Splendors:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trujillo;: The life and times of a Caribbean dictator","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sacred Seven Steps: A Practical Guide to Peace & Freedom","description":"\\"The entire book is magical.

Each chapter is primarily concerned with establishing the  literary identity  of the poet or poets with whom it deals: the work of each is outlined and related to the historical and biographical circumstances in which it was written; and its characteristics are then examined critically in terms relevant to the modern reader. Comparisons are made between different poets, and more general topics  such as the concepts of  classic  and  baroque   are discussed. This book, first published in 1956, had become a standard introductory work for students of French poetry and general readers alike. For this revised edition, originally published in 1973, new chapters have been added on  irregular  seventeenth-century poets and on various modern poets whose work now enables the Surrealist movement to be seen in clearer perspective.

The Allied generals knew the fighting would end precisely at 11:00 A.M, yet in the final hours they flung men against an already beaten Germany. The result? Eleven thousand casualties sufferedmore than during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Why? Allied commanders wanted to punish the enemy to the very last moment and career officers saw a fast-fading chance for glory and promotion. Joseph E. Persico puts the reader in the trenches with the forgotten and the famousamong the latter, Corporal Adolf Hitler, Captain Harry Truman, and Colonels Douglas MacArthur and George Patton. Mainly, he follows ordinary soldiers  lives, illuminating their fate as the end approaches. Persico sets the last day of the war in historic context with a gripping reprise of all that led up to it, from the 1914 assassination of the Austrian archduke, Franz Ferdinand, which ignited the war, to the raw racism black doughboys endured except when ordered to advance and die in the war s last hour. Persico recounts the war s bloody climax in a cinematic style that evokes All Quiet on the Western Front, Grand Illusion, and Paths of Glory. The pointless fighting on the last day of the war is the perfect metaphor for the four years that preceded it, years of senseless slaughter for hollow purposes. This book is sure to become the definitive history of the end of a conflict Winston Churchill called  the hardest, cruelest, and least-rewarded of all the wars that have been fought.

From his earliest Broadway success with Bye Bye Birdie to his triumphant and bittersweet valedictory, 42nd Street, musicals directed by Champion filled the proscenium with life. At their best, they touched the heart and stirred the soul with a skillful blend of elegance and American showmanship. He began his career as one-half of \\"America's Youngest Dance Team\\" with Jeanne Tyler and later teamed with his wife, dance partner, and longtime collaborator, Marge Champion. This romantic ballroom duo danced across America in the smartest clubs and onto the television screen, performing story dances that captivated the country. They ultimately took their talent to Hollywood, where they starred in the 1951 remake of Show Boat, Lovely to Look At, and other films. But Broadway always called to Champion, and in 1959 he was tapped to direct Bye Bye Birdie. The rest is history. In shows like Birdie, Carnival, Hello, Dolly!, I Do! I Do!, Sugar, and 42nd Street, luminaries such as Chita Rivera, Dick Van Dyke, Carol Channing, Mary Martin, Robert Preston, Tony Roberts, Robert Morse, Tammy Grimes, and Jerry Orbach brought Champion's creative vision to life. Working with composers and writers like Jerry Herman, Michael Stewart, Charles Strouse, Lee Adams, and Bob Merrill, he streamlined the musical making it flow effortlessly with song and dance from start to finish. John Gilvey has spoken with many of the people who worked with Champion, and in Before the Parade Passes By he tells the life story of this most American of Broadway musical director-choreographers from his early days dancing with Marge to his final days spent meticulously honing the visual magic of 42nd Street. Before the Parade Passes By is the life story of one man who personified the glory of the Broadway musical right up until the moment of his untimely death. When the curtain fell to thunderous applause on the opening night of 42nd Street, August 25, 1980, legendary impresario David Merrick came forward, silenced the audience, and announced that Champion had died that morning. As eminent theatre critic Ethan Mordden has firmly put it, \\"the Golden Age was over.\\" Though the Golden Age of the Broadway musical is over, John Gilvey brings it to life again by telling the story of Gower Champion, one of its most passionate and creative legends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-WpO6KXkGlAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fix Things","description":"A man tries to take shortcuts in making the badly needed repairs to his aging house but finds himself in a worse situation than before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WIw9OAAACAAJ&dq=The+Man+Who+Was+Too+Lazy+to+Fix+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Optical System Layout: And Use of Stock Lenses","description":"Drawn from the author's extensive seminar experience; this book discusses characteristics of a range of optical components; how to determine components to be used; and how to arrange components so that the system measures up to performance objectives. --","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jR5UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Practical+Optical+System+Layout:+And+Use+of+Stock+Lenses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Repent","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Commentary on the Sonnets of G.M.

Following in the footsteps of Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, Bekoff has spent the last 30 years studying animals of every stripe--from coyotes in Wyoming to penguins in Antarctica. He draws on this vast experience, as well as on the observations of other naturalists, to offer readers fascinating stories of animal behavior, including grooming and gossip, self-medication, feeding patterns, dreaming, dominance, and mating behavior. Many of these stories are truly incredible--chimpanzees medicating themselves with herbal remedies, elephants clearly mourning a dead group member--but this is not simply a catalog of amazing animal tales, for Bekoff also sheds light on many of the more serious issues surrounding animals. He offers a thought-provoking look at animal cognition, intelligence, and consciousness and he presents vivid examples of animal passions, highlighting the deep emotional lives of our animal kin. All this serves as background for his thoughtful conclusions about humility and animal protection and animal well-being, where he urges a new paradigm of respect, grace, compassion, and love for all animals. Marc Bekoff has gone deep into the minds, hearts, spirits, and souls of animals, giving him profound insight into their lives, and no small insight into ours. Minding Animals is an important contribution to our understanding of animal consciousness, a major work that will be a must read for anyone who loves nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aO_hBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hell's Pavement","description":"\\"Mass mind murders- committed in the name of patriotism-- A power placed in your brain guides your every move from birth to death!

Tolkien that has yet been written.   A. N. Wilson As Europe plunged into World War I, J. R. R. Tolkien was a student at Oxford and part of a cohort of literary-minded friends who had wide-ranging conversations in their Tea Club and Barrovian Society. After finishing his degree, Tolkien experienced the horrors of the Great War as a signal officer in the Battle of the Somme, where two of those school friends died. All the while, he was hard at work on an original mythology that would become the basis of his literary masterpiece, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In this biographical study, drawn in part from Tolkien s personal wartime papers, John Garth traces the development of the author s work during this critical period. He shows how the deaths of two comrades compelled Tolkien to pursue the dream they had shared, and argues that the young man used his imagination not to escape from reality but to transform the cataclysm of his generation. While Tolkien s contemporaries surrendered to disillusionment, he kept enchantment alive, reshaping an entire literary tradition into a form that resonates to this day.  Garth s fine study should have a major audience among serious students of Tolkien.   Publishers Weekly  A highly intelligent book . . .

Using a topical approach to provide broad thematic coverage of the period from 1500 to 1648, each chapter focuses on a specific area of French history: politics and thestate, the economy, society and culture, religion, and gender and the family. The book is more than a collection of topical essays, however, as each chapter is linked to the others, together forming a coherent narrative of French history from the advent of the Reformation, through the civil wars ofthe second half of the sixteenth century, to the Fronde. The result is the most up-to-date synthesis of this period, showing how recent scholarship has significantly revised the traditional narrative of French history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i5ZjQgAACAAJ&dq=Renaissance+and+Reformation+France:+1500-1648+(Short+Oxford+History+of+France)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FAITH IS","description":"This touching collection of inspirational thoughts focuses on the true meaning of faith in our ordinary lives.

S. Pritchett, available for the first time in a single volume A Cab at the Door, originally published in 1968, recalls his childhood in turn-of-the-century and World War I London with the urbane subtlety and wry humor that have marked his other works. For the wild and eccentric Pritchett family, life is a series of cabs waiting at the door to transport them to a succession of ten-bob-a-week lodgings, in their flight from creditors and the financial disasters of their father. A Cab at the Door also captures the texture and color of the working-class side of Edwardian England. Midnight Oil (which Wilfrid Sheed called a  little Rolls Royce of a book  when it came out in 1972) opens in 1921: Pritchett arrives in Paris to commence with a literary career. Gradually, his creative sensibilities emerge as he travels as a reporter to Ireland, Spain, and America. Midnight Oil provides an intimate and precise record of a writer's discovery of himself and his art.  Pritchett is one of the great pleasure-givers in our language,  said Eudora Welty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QLpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Cab+at+the+Door&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ingles en un dos por tres (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"449 Stupid Things Democrats Have Said","description":"Just in time for election season, political science professor and admitted political junkie Ted Rueter has compiled 449 stupid quotes, from Democrats and Republicans, drawn from a wide variety of sources, with full citations.

Thus begins Emma Tennant's inspired sequel to Jane Austen's most beloved novel, Pride and Prejudice. With wit and style and genuine insight into character, Pemberley brilliantly delineates the perils and pleasures of a marriage between two people as strong-willed and prickly as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. A year after wedding, Christmas approaches. As happy as she has been living in relative seclusion with Mr. Darcy and his sister Georgiana at their magnificent Derbyshire estate, Pemberley, Elizabeth is sensible that the time has come to invite her mother and sister to visit her. What begins as a small and manageable family party (although any party any includes the regrettable Mrs. Bennet will take considerable managing) soon grows all out of proportion. A gathering including the Bennets, the Bingleys, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh-as affable and condescending as ever-can only mean missteps, gaffes and hurt feelings. When Darcy becomes increasingly distant and Elizabeth falls prey to vicious gossip, the forces of pride and prejudice are at work once again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tJEwhwQADDgC&dq=Pemberley+(Charnwood+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Bible Crafts for Preschoolers","description":"Kids love crafts!

The air force evokes images of pilots operating hightech weapons systems, striking precisely from out of the blue to lay waste to enemy installations. The fundamental icon for the Marine Corps is a wave of riflemen hitting the beaches from rugged landing craft and slogging their way ashore under enemy fire. How did these very different relationships with technology develop? During the interwar years, from 1920 to 1940, leaders from the Army Air Corps and the Marine Corps recreated their agencies based on visions of new military technologies. In War Machines, Timothy Moy examines these recreations and explores how factors such as bureaucratic pressure, institutional culture, and America's technological enthusiasm shaped these leaders' choices. The very existence of the Army Air Corps was based on a new technology, the airplane. As the Air Corps was forced to compete for money and other resources during the years after World War I, Air Corps leaders carved out a military niche based on hightech precision bombing. The Marine Corps focused on amphibious, firstwave assault using sturdy, graceless, and easytoproduce landing craft. Moy's astute analysis makes it clear that studying the processes that shaped the Army Air Corps and Marine Corps is fundamental to our understanding of technology and the military at the beginning of the twentyfirst century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_iSpCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Currency of Hope","description":"\\"We, the men and women of Debtors Anonymous, come together to solve our common problem of compulsive debting.

Focusing on the culture of Kabuki theatre in Osaka and Kyoto, it illustrates the passionate hero worship of actors by all levels of society. Fans vigorously engaged in the creation of celebrity and fame for their idols, and thereby won their own moments of glory and glamour in the spotlight. Many of these participants are represented here - most of them ordinary townsmen, but also a few samurai and courtiers. This interactive nature of Kabuki culture is particularly intriguing: the actors themselves not only appeared on stage, but involved themselves in other cultural circles such as poetry salons. Kabuki fan clubs, on the other hand, performed formal rituals at the theatre, individual fans became amateur performers, while others created lavish colour prints and books to support favourite actors and spread their fame.\\" \\"This catalogue illustrates that our obsession with celebrity is not just a modern phenomenon: in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Osaka we can rediscover many elements in common with our own times. Most importantly, after the spread of new colour-woodblock printing technology in the late 1760s, a golden age of popular Kabuki culture was promoted far and wide with beautifully coloured prints and books. The fine examples brought together here from leading public and private collections in Europe and Japan evoke a fascinating period when theatre, art and poetry were essential elements of social and cultural life.\\"--BOOK JACKET","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qCM4AQAAIAAJ&dq=HEROES+OF+THE+KABUKI+STAGE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Word For World is Forest","description":"When the inhabitants of a peaceful world are conquered by the bloodthirsty yumens, their existence is irrevocably altered.

Phillip's fortunes begin to change when the Lord of the local castle, Lord Ravenor, offers to further Phillip s education in exchange for his positive influence on his unruly nephew. A dark, moody, and thrilling tale from the popular author. E. Phillips Oppenheim (1866-1946) was a hugely prolific and highly popular British author of novels and short stories. Born in Tottenham, London, Oppenheim left school as a teenager and worked for his leather-merchant father for 20 years prior to launching his literary career. Oppenheim published five novels under the pseudonym  Anthony Partridge  before establishing his reputation as a writer under his own name. An internationally successful author, Oppenheim s stories revolved mainly around glamourous characters, luxurious settings, and themes of espionage, suspense, and crime. He is widely regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of the thriller and spy-fiction genre as it is recognised today. Oppenheim s incredible literary success meant that his own life soon began to mirror that of his opulent characters. He held lavish, Gatsby-style parties at his French Villa and was rumoured to have had frequent love affairs aboard his luxury yacht. Oppenheim s success earned him the cover of Time magazine in 1927.

From the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, the American economy has been transformed by wave after wave of emerging technology: the steam engine, electricity, the internal combustion engine, computer technology. Yet technology-driven change leads to growing misalignment between an innovative economy and anachronistic legal and political structures until the gap is closed by the modernization of America's institutions often amid upheavals such as the Civil War and Reconstruction and the Great Depression and World War II. When the U.S. economy has flourished, government and business, labor and universities, have worked together in a never-ending project of economic nation building.

We discover a teenaged Mao Tse-Tung refusing an arranged marriage; Idi Amin cooking for the British Army; Stalin living in a seminary; and a melodramatic young Adolf Hitler dreaming of vast architectural achievements. Pol Pot and Rafael Trujillo are also subjects of separate stories.

How should we accept growing old? It's an inevitable progression and yet in Western society the very subject of aging is often taboo and shrouded in anxiety and shame. Not anymore, says Marie de Hennezel, an internationally renowned clinical psychologist and bestselling author. Now that our lives are longer and richer than ever before, it's imperative to demystify our greatest fear and cultivate a positive awareness of aging. In this timely and essential book, de Hennezel offers a fresh perspective on the art of growing old. She confronts head-on the inevitable grief we sustain at the loss of our youth and explains how refusing to age and move forward in life is actually what makes us become old. Combining personal anecdotes with psychological theory, philosophy, and eye-opening scientific research from around the world, she shows why we should look forward to embracing everything aging has to offer in terms of human and spiritual enrichment. The Art of Growing Old is a thought-provoking, brave, and uplifting meditation on the later years as they should be lived.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GsBknXiZ3UMC&dq=The+ART+OF+GROWING+OLD:+WRITERS+ON+LIVING+AND+AGING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Immigrant Success Story: East Indians in America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Writer's Paris","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Poisoned Chalice","description":"After a devastating terrorist attack, the U.S.S Titan is ordered back to Earth, where Captain Riker witnesses the subsequent hunt for the perpetrators, which involves the interrogation of Starfleet personnel at the highest levels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=maweAgAAQBAJ&dq=Poisoned+Chalice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Illustrations for Youth Talks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Conflict and courage: Devotional guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"MCSE: Windows Server 2003 Active Directory Planning, Implementation, and Maintenance Study Guide (70-294)","description":"Here's the book you need to prepare for Exam 70-294, Planning, Implementing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Active Directory Infrastructure.

Against the epic backdrop of the building of the Union Pacific Railroad across plains and deserts and through the mountains to meet up with the Southern Pacific in Utah comes a sprawling, historical tale. Warren Neale is a brilliant civil engineer who is constantly confronted with construction problems. He is sided by Larry Red King, a Texas gunfighter and friend. Allie Lee, who is heading east from California on a wagon train, is the sole survivor of an Indian raid in the Black Hills. Neale and a small company of US cavalry find Allie hidden at the scene and nearly out of her mind in terror. Al Slingerland, a trapper and buffalo hunter, has a cabin in a nearby valley, and Allie is taken there to recover. Benton is the wild town set up overnight to service the vices of the multitude of railroad workers. The only law is that which the soldiers impose, but their concern is not really in enforcing law in Benton, but in protecting the men laying the tracks and the supply trains. In addition to the natural obstacles that impede the building of the Union Pacific, workers must contend with the equally great weight of constant graft and corruption, against which Larry Red King s guns can afford no protection. In this magnificent panorama of constant danger and adventure, the many lives involved, including ruthless gamblers and women of the evening, and the slow but monumental progress of the laying of the track through the wilderness, Zane Grey vividly brings to life a lost time and society in a grand novel, now published as he had first written it.

A machine for language? Certainly, say the neurophysiologists, busy studying the language specializations of the human brain and trying to identify their evolutionary antecedents. Linguists such as Noam Chomsky talk about machinelike \\"modules\\" in the brain for syntax, arguing that language is more an instinct (a complex behavior triggered by simple environmental stimuli) than an acquired skill like riding a bicycle. But structured language presents the same evolutionary problems as feathered forelimbs for flight: you need a lot of specializations to fly even a little bit. How do you get them, if evolution has no foresight and the intermediate stages do not have intermediate payoffs? Some say that the Darwinian scheme for gradual species self-improvement cannot explain our most valued human capability, the one that sets us so far above the apes, language itself. William Calvin and Derek Bickerton suggest that other evolutionary developments, not directly related to language, allowed language to evolve in a way that eventually promoted a Chomskian syntax. They compare these intermediate behaviors to the curb-cuts originally intended for wheelchair users. Their usefulness was soon discovered by users of strollers, shopping carts, rollerblades, and so on. The authors argue that reciprocal altruism and ballistic movement planning were \\"curb-cuts\\" that indirectly promoted the formation of structured language. Written in the form of a dialogue set in Bellagio, Italy, Lingua ex Machina presents an engaging challenge to those who view the human capacity for language as a winner-take-all war between Chomsky and Darwin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6uPGcw0tBF0C&dq=Lingua+ex+Machina:+Reconciling+Darwin+and+Chomsky+with+the+Human+Brain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Practical Spirituality: How to Bring More Passion, Creativity and Balance into Everyday Life (Pocket Guide to Practical Spirituality) (Pocket Guides to Practical Spirituality)","description":"\\"Create an intimate relationship with Spirit  Highly inspirational and divinely readable.

Prior to this the company had offered commercial cars, including depot hacks and delivery van bodies mounted on its standard passenger car chassis. Dealers had also offered small after-market pickup beds that could be placed on the rear of a Model T car to convert it to a pickup. But with the debut of the rugged Model TT truck chassis, Ford was firmly in the truck market. Eight years later it introduced its first factory-produced pickup, a sturdy half-ton job that met with great acceptance. During the century that has passed since that first Ford truck chassis, the F-series has become the best-selling truck in the world, and the best-selling vehicle of any type in America. Every year the company sells over 700,000 F-series trucks, and well over 1.5 million trucks of all types, just in the U.S. It's an amazing success. Ford Tough: 100 Years of Ford Trucks tells the entire Ford truck story from the very beginning, when Ford got its start in truck production. This book provides the history of the wide array of models Ford has built over the past century, including the Model A roadster pick-up, stylish 81C pickups, legendary 1948 F-1, Bronco, Courier, Ranchero, Econoline.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FpyyDgAAQBAJ&dq=FORD+Trucks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Reckoning: Great Adventure Writing from the Golden Age of Exploration, 1800-1900 (Outside Books)","description":"Collects top nineteenth-century discovery voyage stories including those about Fridtjob Nansen's solitary walk to the North Pole, Mary Kingsley's forays into the West African jungle, and Richard Burton's forbidden pilgrimage to Mecca. 30,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ms_SZNNP3yMC&dq=Dead+Reckoning:+Great+Adventure+Writing+from+the+Golden+Age+of+Exploration,+1800-1900+(Outside+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elstree: The British Hollywood","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B-gdAAAAMAAJ&dq=Elstree:+The+British+Hollywood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"300 Great Baseball Cards of the 20th Century: A Historical Tribute by the Hobby's Most Relied Up","description":"\\"Beckett Baseball Card Monthly\\" managing editor Mike Payne and his staff have selected the greatest baseball cards of the century for this volume.

Today her presence is calm and warm. I knew her as a quiet, terrified child struggling to grow up, nay, even to stay alive in a large violent matriarchal family. There was no father figure, only a sequence of men. Diane was thirteen years old when I first met her. Through a program in the California Department of Social Services, I had been assigned to be Big Sister to a younger sister of Diane. This younger sister was also badly abused both in maternal violence and in sexual abuse, as was Diane, but to a much lesser degree. I thought of Diane's mother as a raging bull with massive mood swings from manipulative and charming to a cruel, mean and evil woman. I myself was afraid of her. If I had known what was really going on during the years I worked with the family, I would not have had the power to do anything about it. My only hope and motivation at that time was to give them a view of what life was like from a different perspective and thus help them be kinder to their children. I am always appalled by the fact that Social Services felt it was best to keep children connected to their families no matter how monstrous the evil in the home.

Over a decade before The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, award-winning author Rumer Godden was delighting readers with the exploits of the residents and staff at a quaint getaway resort in southern India. Wily and winning Anglo-Indian hotel owner Auntie Sanni has entertained all manner of guests during her many years as hostess at Patna Hall, a popular vacation spot on the lush Coromandel coast. Now, with an election coming, business is especially brisk, and her hotel is packed with Indian politicians, British diplomats, journalists, American tourists even a donkey, an elephant, and a woman of mystery or two. Among the vacationers are Mary and Blaise, a young English couple on their honeymoon. But where Mary is enchanted by the colors, sounds, and vibrant Indian life, prim and priggish Blaise sees only squalor, sordidness, and a Coromandel Sea teeming with sharks. Matters are only made worse when Mary becomes interested in local Indian politics particularly the handsome, exquisitely spoken candidate Krishnan, whose kindness and wisdom are like a balm for her spirit. As tensions between the newlyweds continue to mount, even resourceful Auntie Sanni may not be able to forestall potential unpleasantness or prevent it from escalating into tragedy. The acclaimed author of Black Narcissus and The River returns readers once again to her beloved India with a novel brimming with heart, wit, unforgettable characters, and  a sense of timelessness reminiscent of E. M. Forster  (The Times, London).

Yet few people today are familiar with the majority of tales from the two early volumes, since in the next four decades the Grimms would publish six other editions, each extensively revised in content and style. For the very first time, 'The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm' makes available in English all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions. These narrative gems, newly translated and brought together in one beautiful book, are accompanied by sumptuous new illustrations from award-winning artist Andrea Dezs?. From 'The Frog King' to 'The Golden Key, ' wondrous worlds unfold--heroes and heroines are rewarded, weaker animals triumph over the strong, and simple bumpkins prove themselves not so simple after all. Esteemed fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes offers accessible translations that retain the spare description and engaging storytelling style of the originals. Indeed, this is what makes the tales from the 1812 and 1815 editions unique--they reflect diverse voices, rooted in oral traditions, that are absent from the Grimms' later, more embellished collections of tales. Zipes's introduction gives important historical context, and the book includes the Grimms' prefaces and notes.

Davis broke down distinctions between the private and the public worlds, distinctions that trapped women in the ideology of domesticity. By engaging current strategies in literary hermeneutics with a strong sense of historical radicalism in the Gilded Age, Jean Pfaelzer reads Davis through the public issues that she forcefully inscribed in her fiction. In this study, Davis's realistic narratives actively construct a coherent social work, not in a fictional vacuum but in direct engagement with the explosive movements of social change from the Civil War through the turn of the century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9FW59a17sdgC&dq=Editing+Digital+Video+:+The+Complete+Creative+and+Technical+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver-Tongued Devil","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Different Roads","description":"The works in this anthology reflect both the myth and the truth about the part of the United States we call the  West.

Do the films Alien and Aliens signify the reemergence of the earth goddess as a vital cultural power? What female archetypes, borne out of male desire, inform the experience of women in Nine and a Half Weeks?These are among the several compelling questions the authors of this volume consider as they explore the way popular American film relates to religion. Oddly, religion and film?two pervasive elements of American culture?have seldom been studied in connection with each other. In this first systematic exploration, the authors look beyond surface religious themes and imagery in film, discovering a deeper, implicit presence of religion. They employ theological, mythological, and social and political criticism to analyze the influence of religion, in all its rich variety and diversity, on popular film. Perhaps more importantly, they consider how the medium of film has helped influence and shape American religious culture, secular or otherwise.More than a random collection of essays, this volume brings to the study of religion and film a carefully constructed analytic framework that advances our understanding of both. Screening the Sacred provides fresh and welcome insight to film criticism; it also holds far-reaching relevance for the study of religion. Progressive in its approach, instructive in its analyses, this book is written for students, scholars, and other readers interested in religion, popular film, and the impact of each on American culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vf_EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matthew for Everyone: Chapters 16-28 (New Testament for Everyone)","description":"Tom Wright's eye-opening comments on the Gospel of Matthew and what it might mean for us are combined, passage-by-passage, with his fresh translation of the Bible text.

Hugh Grady argues that Shakespeare's social criticism in fact often parallels that of critics of modernity from our own Postmodernist era. Thus the broad analysis of modernity produced by Marx, Horkheimer and Adorno, Foucault, and others can serve to illuminate Shakespeare's own depiction of an emerging modernity - a depiction epitomized by the image in Troilus and Cressida of 'an universal wolf' of appetite, power, and will. The readings of Troilus and Cressida, Othello, King Lear, and As You Like It in Shakespeare's Universal Wolf demonstrate Shakespeare's keen interest in what twentieth-century theory has called 'reification' - a term which designates social systems created by human societies but which confront those societies as operating beyond human control, according to an autonomous 'systems' logic - in nascent mercantile capitalism, in power-oriented Machiavellian politics, and in the scientistic, value-free rationality which Horkheimer and Adorno call 'instrumental reason'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8tDt1Q_UWpMC&dq=Shakespeare%27s+Universal+Wolf:+Postmodernist+Studies+in+Early+Modern+Reification&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Looking at the Sky (My First Field Guides)","description":"Provides a guide for beginning stargazers, including sky maps and constellation charts, identification tips, and space facts and jokes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_XfTDQAAQBAJ&dq=Looking+at+the+Sky+(My+First+Field+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arden Dictionary of Shakespeare Quotations (Arden Dictionary of Shakespeare Quotations (Cloth))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Khans Unlimited: 50 Years of Squash in Pakistan (Jubilee Series)","description":"With the legendary Hashim Khan leading the way, the mighty Khans of Pakistan have dominated squash for five decades.

Scott Fitzgerald washed up, alcoholic and ill dedicated himself to devising a heartfelt course in literature for the woman he loved. In 1937, on the night of her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, Sheilah Graham met F. Scott Fitzgerald at a party in Hollywood. Graham, a British-born journalist, broke off her engagement, and until Fitzgerald had a fatal heart attack in her apartment in 1940, the two writers lived the fervid, sometimes violent affair that is memorialized here with unprecedented intimacy. When they met, Fitzgerald s fame had waned. He battled crippling alcoholism while writing screenplays to support his daughter and institutionalized wife. Graham s star, however, was rising, to the point where she became Hollywood s highest-paid, best-read gossip columnist. But if Fitzgerald had lived out his  crack-up  in public, Graham kept her demons secret such as that she believed herself to be  a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood s eyes.   Most poignantly, she keenly felt her lack of education, and Fitzgerald rose to the occasion. He became her passionate tutor, guiding her through a curriculum of his own design: a college of one. Graham loved him the more for it, writing the book as a tribute. As she explained,  An unusual man s ideas on what constituted an education had to be preserved. It is a new chapter to add to what is already known about an author who has been microscopically investigated in all the other areas of his life.

These difficulties may be specific, as occurs when a child experiences problems with some particular task such as reading, or they can be more general, as occurs when learning is slower than normal across a range of tasks. In this book Julie Dockrell and John McShane aim to give a clear account of learning difficulties, linking the theoretical with the practical in an accessible framework. A central theme of the book is the role that cognitive factors play in learning difficulties. What impedes a child's progress in acquiring new knowledge? Why are children with learning difficulties impoverished in their use of strategies? How do children with learning difficulties differ from children developing without such problems? The authors argue that in order both to assess a child's problems and to design successful intervention programs it is essential to have an understanding of the demands placed on a child's cognitive system and the abilities of that system to deal with these demands They go on to describe the skills and strategies children need in order to read, spell, talk and use arithmetic; they show how to assess what missing skills and techniques lie behind learning difficulties, and discuss techniques which can be used to correct and compensate for these problems. Throughout the authors aim to give practitioners a way, based in theory, of evaluating and tackling the problems facing any given child.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rBraWo3i2BcC&dq=Learning+Problems:+A+Cognitive+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insight Out: Reversing Vandalism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2IGHtwAACAAJ&dq=Insight+Out:+Reversing+Vandalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"5K and 10K Training","description":"Make your workouts count with the breakthrough system that synchronizes your energy levels with your training effort.

The young count was surrounded by representatives of the gilded youth, who give the tone in the Jockey Club, and are the recognized authorities for all Europe in questions of taste, fashion, and sport. Baron Danglars was the centre of a group of bankers, to whom he developed his celebrated projects which had increased his millions, taking good care, however, not to mention his losses. Madame Danglars, the handsome mother of the pretty Eugenie, was surrounded by a circle of young and Old cavaliers, who paid court to her with the greatest ceremony, and whose adorations were accepted by the lady as a tribute due her, although it could not be denied that she favored the young attache' Debray.

It describes the pitfalls of psychology, and the remedies that can be applied. A strong dependence on statistics and the experimental method is emphasized as essential to good psychology. The book is divided into four sections: Intelligence Testing, Vocational Psychology, Abnormal Behaviour, and Social Attitudes.

Modernity is an upstart rather than a scion of an old and celebrated line. The roots of modernity are held to be less secure than previously thought. This leads the author to suggest that the demise of the old is a matter of rhetoric rather than reality. The old was driven underground rather than extinguished. The inherited traditions are deeply embedded in our souls. We turn to modernity as a half-baked worldview to overcome our estrangement from the past.Kinneging examines this sweeping view in the concrete circumstances of the imagined fall of the aristocracy and rise of the enterprising bourgeoisie. But aristocracy, this study reveals a strong and thriving noblesse, not only in places like Russia and Prussia, but also in advanced capitalist states like France and England. Aristocracy, Antiquity, and History shows conclusively that the actual demise of this exploration into the sources of Western thought takes seriously the strength of an aristocratic vision that lives on in a variety of conservative and liberal doctrines.In Aristocracy, Antiquity and History the readers is reacquainted with the democratic potential as in the work of Montesquieu, and the way in which classicism, romanticism, and modernism, far from a sequential set of events, are entwined in the ethic of honor and in the moral order of modern life. In trying to understand modernity, advanced societies cannot help but draw attention to the old by way of contrast. The presence of antiquity, however suppressed or shrugged off, does not disappear, but stays with us in the very act of rebellion against the ancients. This fine work in the history of ideas will serve to redefine and redirect researches in social and political theory for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qIBPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 4-Week Ultimate Body Detox Plan: A Program for Greater Energy, Health, and Vitality","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Death in the desert,: The fifty years' war for the great Southwest,","description":"The author covers conflicts from 1837 through 1886 in Arizona, New Mexico, and California.

In Teaching White Supremacy, Donald Yacovone shows us the clear and damning evidence of white supremacy's deep-seated roots in our nation's education system in a fascinating, in-depth examination of America's wide assortment of texts, from primary readers to college textbooks and other higher-ed course materials. Sifting through a wealth of materials, from the colonial era to today, Yacovone reveals the systematic ways in which white supremacist ideology has infiltrated American culture and how it has been at the heart of our collective national identity. Yacovone lays out the arc of America's white supremacy from the country's inception and Revolutionary years to its 19th century flashpoint of civil war; to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and today's Black Lives Matter. And, the author argues that it is the North, not the South, that bears the greater responsibility for creating the dominant strain of race theory, inculcated throughout the culture and in school textbooks, that restricted and repressed African Americans and other minorities, even as Northerners blamed the South for its legacy of slavery, segregation and racial injustice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y62BEAAAQBAJ&dq=History+of+American+politics+(Handbooks+for+students+and+general+readers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of the Muscatine North & South Railroad Company","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Scan and Print Book","description":"Many designers and photographers own the entire suite of Adobe s creative products, but they manage to learn only one or two of the applications really well.

He then charts a road map to the future, giving us a preview of what lies ahead if we continue our present course. And finally, he compares this reality with the attainable ideal that is possible if we begin now to implement long term plans to solve the seemingly insurmountable problems we currently face. Future Perfect is more than an illumination of tomorrow. It explains how we got where we are today, what lies ahead, and what we can do to improve the quality of our lives and our world. It will challenge our deepest assumptions but the irrefutable logic of Williams' system verifies how solutions to problems are within our power to effect if we use our ability to think about the future and have the courage to act. Future Perfect can, if we heed its teachings, enable us to regain personal and societal control of our lives and, as informed citizens, regain economic and political control of our country.

Above all, co-leadership is inclusive, not exclusive. It celebrates those who do the real work, not just a few charismatic often isolated leaders who are regally compensated for articulating the organization's vision.\\" -David A. Heenan and Warren Bennis Today's heads of big companies are as recognizable to us as the most popular entertainers or sports stars, but the heart and soul of every organization are those leaders below the CEO. Today's celebrity CEO has become either a figure head or an egomaniac, and often too public a personality to get the real work done. That work is done instead by teams of leaders-exceptional deputies who forge great partnerships to maximize both organizational and personal success. Heenan and Bennis believe we must look beyond the Bill Gateses of the world to understand what makes an organization excel. Written for CEOs, managers, and anyone else interested in modern organizations, this is the first comprehensive study of co-leaders and their often quiet power. Exhaustively researched and illustrated with memorable anecdotes and lively stories, Co-Leaders examines a dozen great partners such as Steve Ballmer of Microsoft, Bob Lutz of Chrysler, Bill Guthridge, coach of the University of North Carolina basketball team, and Anne Sullivan Macy, Helen Keller's teacher. The changing nature of corporate leadership has seen the emergence of a new Silicon Valley model of success, where boss and subordinate seem more like peers with the spotlight on great partnerships. Talent, not title, is the source of power at a growing number of hot high-tech companies. In these collegial, non-hierarchical organizations, today's deputy can become tomorrow's CEO simply by taking his or her breakthrough idea and walking out the door. Good ideas belong, initially at least, to the people who have them, not to the company and not to the boss which is why this new egalitarianism isn't just a matter of style-it's a question of survival. Co-leaders know both the executive and subordinate experience, making them better adapted to the needs of the new millennium where men and women who can command and follow will prove to be the greatest assets of any organization. Co-Leaders is intended for everyone who aspires to make his or her organization great. By showing the enterprise through the eyes of inspired deputies, this book reveals how both organizations and individuals can benefit from a more inclusive, less celebrity-oriented definition of leadership. This groundbreaking book argues for a new paradigm: gifted leaders and their talented co-leaders working together to make their organizations stronger, more nimble, more equitable...and ultimately more successful.

During the intervening years, there has been little to add to our views as to the best management of acetabular fractures, but an additional chapter has been incorporated comprising recent findings in our patients and slight changes in emphasis on the indications for operations. Additionally, having recognised that one of the greatest difficulties in this method of treatment lies in the pre-operative assessment of the standard radiographs, we have prepared a short series of radiographs which the reader may find advantageous for study. We are grateful to Mr. Reginald Eison who has translated and revised the French edition. Considerable alteration of the text and the general presen tation was necessary in order to make the material palatable in English. Our thanks are due to our new publishers, Springer-Verlag, for their keen interest and skill. E. LETOURNEL R. JUDET Preface to the French Edition It is a long time since we first attempted surgical treatment of fractures of the acetabulum accompanied by displacement, with the aim of restoring perfect articulation.

A comprehensive visual reference, the book covers everything a home sewer craves: the basics of sewing by hand or machine, along with five other time-honored crafts techniques, and step-by-step instructions for more than 150 projects that reflect not only Martha Stewart s depth of experience and crafting expertise, but also her singular sense of style. Encyclopedic in scope, the book features two main parts to help you brush up on the basics and take your skills to a new level. First, the Techniques section guides readers through Sewing, Appliqu , Embroidery, Quilting, Dyeing, and Printing. Following that, the Projects A to Z section features more than 150 clever ideas (including many no-sew projects), all illustrated and explained with the clear, detailed instructions that have become a signature of Martha Stewart s magazines, books, and television shows. An enclosed CD includes full-size clothing patterns as well as templates that can be easily produced on a home printer. Fabric, thread, and tool glossaries identify the properties, workability, and best uses of common sewing materials. And, perhaps best of all, when you need it most, Martha and her talented team of crafts editors offer you the reassurance that you really can make it yourself. The projects are as delightful as they are imaginative, and include classic Roman shades, hand-drawn stuffed animals, an easy upholstered blanket chest, a quilted crib bumper, French knot-embellished pillowcases and sheets, and Japanese-embroidered table linens, among many others.With gorgeous color photographs as well as expert instruction, this handy guide will surely encourage beginners and keep sewers and crafters of all experience levels wonderfully busy for many years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5sd1imb1j4kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soviet Military Strategy - Fully Analyzed & Annotated With Recent Supplementary Soviet Materials","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Biology (Barron's EZ-101 Study Keys)","description":"(back cover) ez-101 study keys Designed to be compatible with virtually every standard textbook in their subject field, \\" Barrona s EZ-101 Study Keys \\" give you a valuable overview of your college-level course.

Hunt continues to chart the way from unjust, unequal power relationships to new experiences of mutuality through friendship.... Employing a combination of sources such as literature, case studies, and first-person accounts that easily span the gaps across racial and religious difference, gender preference and orientation, and geographical loci, this text maps new socio-ethical and theological interpretations for friendship. Hunt [contends] that when women choose to live in right relationship, new and compelling paradigms of the holy emerge, connoting co-responsibility, mutual influence, and commitment on both sides of the divine-human equation.\\"-Susan Brooks Thistlewaite and Toinette M. Eugene, Chicago Theological Seminary\\"In theory as well as in practice, Hunt's work begs to be taken seriously and to be taken further.... To look to it [merely] for one additional chapter-friendship as a new theme-to add to a course in systematic theology, will lead to disappointment. The book is far too radical and too important for that. It risks changing the grammar of the enterprise, and it may well give rise to speech that is brand new.\\"-Sharon H.

Although Christianity is generally considered a Western religion, it is important to recognize that the Bible itself was written and set in the Eastern world, and it must be viewed through the light of that Eastern window. It is primarily the area referred to at varying times as the Near East, Middle East, or Orient where the people and events described in the Bible resided. Resultantly, in order to really understand the Bible, one must become knowledgeable of the culture, manners, and customs of the Eastern world. This book opens the doors of enlightenment into the culture that provides the setting for the lives, events, and tenets central to Christianity. It is a book that warrants more than a cursory reading.

They were in for a surprise. For behind the walls of Wall Street's firms lies a stratum of stunted, overworked, abused, and in the end, very well-compensated, but very frustrated men and women. Monkey Business takes readers behind the scenes at Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette (DLJ), one of Wall Street's hottest firms of the 90s, from the interview process to the courting of clients to bonus time. It's a glimpse of a side of the business the financial periodicals don't talk about -- 20-hour work days, trips across the country where associates do nothing except carry the pitch book, strip clubs at night, inflated salaries, and high-powered, unforgettable personalities. Monkey Business provides readers with a first-class education in the real life of an investment banker. But best of all, it is an extremely funny read about two young men who, on their way towards achieving the American dream, quickly realized they were selling their souls to get there.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BGFZWAhDCgkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arm of Kannon, Vol. 7","description":"Shozen Garama's quest for eternal life has finally reunited the Arm of Kannon with the Holy Grail.

The New York Times NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BUSINESSWEEK In this business classic now with a new Afterword in which the author draws parallels to the recent financial crisis Roger Lowenstein captures the gripping roller-coaster ride of Long-Term Capital Management. Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall. When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored. Praise for When Genius Failed  [Roger] Lowenstein has written a squalid and fascinating tale of world-class greed and, above all, hubris.  BusinessWeek  Compelling . . .

The very attributes that make us human--free will, the permanence of personal identity, the existence of the soul--are being undermined and threatened by the current revolution in the science of the mind. If the mind is the brain, and therefore a physical object subject to deterministic laws, how can we have free will? If most of our thoughts and impulses are unconscious, how can we be morally responsible for what we do? The Problem of the Soul shows the way out of these seemingly intractable paradoxes. Framing the conflict in terms of two dominant visions of the mind--the \\"manifest image\\" of humanistic philosophy and theology, and the scientific image--renowned philosopher Owen Flanagan demonstrates that there is, in fact, common ground, and that we need not give up our ideas of moral responsibility and personal freedom in order to have an empirically sound view of the human mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1sg8tAEACAAJ&dq=The+Problem+Of+The+Soul:+Two+Visions+Of+Mind+And+How+To+Reconcile+Them&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Facets Non Violent Non Sexist Video Guid","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Open Heart: Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Heart and Soul (Harlequin Superromance No. 1255)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Def Leppard - Slang","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dukays","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Antique Maps and Their Cartographers (First Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ol' Max Evans: The First Thousand Years","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Heart of God","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Compendium of Landshells: A Full-Color Guide to More than 2,000 of the World's Terrestrial Shells","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Man-made disaster;: The story of St. Francis Dam, (Western lands and waters series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER (REILLY VAMPIRE CHRONICLES, NO 1)","description":"He s undead, overweight, and can t get a date Vampire, nosferatu, creature of the night whatever you call him Jules Duchon has lived (so to speak) in New Orleans far longer than there have been drunk coeds on Bourbon Street.

What s worse, after more than a century of being undead, he s watched his neighborhood truly go to hell and now, a new vampire is looking to drive him out altogether.

Young, cocky, and black, Malice warns Jules that his days of feasting on sisters and brothers are over. He tells Jules he d better confine himself to white victims or else face the consequences. And then, just to prove he isn t kidding, Malice burns Jules s house to the ground. With the help of Maureen, the morbidly obese, stripper-vampire who made him, and Doodlebug, an undead cross-dresser who (literally) flies in from the coast Jules must find a way to contend with the hurdles that life throws at him . . . without getting a stake through the heart.

Between the years 1950 and 1959, at Menninger and later at the National Institute of Mental Health (as first chief of family studies), he worked clinically with over 500 schizophrenic families. This extensive experience was a time of fruition for his thinking as he began to conceptualize human behavior as emerging from within the context of a family system. Later, at Georgetown University Medical School, Bowen worked to extend the application of his ideas to the neurotic family system. Initially he saw his work as an amplification and modification of Freudian theory, but later viewed it as an evolutionary step toward understanding human beings as functioning within their primary networkDtheir family. One of the most renowned theorist and therapist in the field of family work, this book encompasses the breadth and depth of Bowen's contributions. It presents the evolution of Bowen's Family Theory from his earliest essays on schizophrenic families and their treatment, through the development of his concepts of triangulation, intergenerational conflict and societal regression, and culminating in his brilliant exploration of the differentiation of one's self in one's family of origin.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4g7PdF6oW6EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"In Quest of Jesus: A Guidebook","description":"This highly praised guide to the understanding of Jesus and the gospels prepares the reader to deal with literary sources, historical reconstruction, and continuing issues in the quest for Jesus.

Now, for the first time in decades, readers in the United States can read the books of Dance as they were originally published as twelve individual novels but with a twenty-first-century twist: they re available only as e-books. The ninth volume, The Military Philosophers (1968), takes the series through the end of the war. Nick has found a place, reasonably tolerable by army standards, as an assistant liaison with foreign governments in exile. But like the rest of his countrymen, he is weary of life in uniform and looking ahead to peacetime. Until then, however, the fortunes of war continue to be unpredictable: more names are cruelly added to the bill of mortality, while other old friends and foes prosper. Widmerpool becomes dangerously entranced by the beautiful, fascinating, and vicious Pamela Flitton; and Nick s old flame Jean Duport makes a surprising reappearance. Elegiac and moving, but never without wit and perception, this volume wraps up Powell s unsurpassed treatment of England s finest yet most costly hour. \\"Anthony Powell is the best living English novelist by far.

Set in a dangerous near future world, The Book of M tells the captivating story of a group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself. One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man s shadow disappears an occurrence science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: the loss of all their memories. Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max s shadow disappears too. Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless. As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure. Like The Passage and Station Eleven, this haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful novel explores fundamental questions of memory, connection, and what it means to be human in a world turned upside down.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYEzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lunenburg County Virginia will book 3, 1778-1791","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XROcbwAACAAJ&dq=Lunenburg+County+Virginia+will+book+3,+1778-1791&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Bend in the Road","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Writing Non-Fiction and Getting Published Pb","description":"Do you have a compelling vision for a story set in the past?

Better services, lower prices and greater accountability are the promises made by politicians, senior executives, and investment companies when functions are moved from the public sector to private enterprise. But in Privatization, Graeme A. Hodge challenges these assumptions. Through an examination of hundreds of international studies on the performance of privatization activities, Hodge demonstrates that privatizing public services is often not the guaranteed panacea portrayed by its political supporters. Importantly, privatization activities can lead to modest gains, but there are also winners and losers in this reform. It therefore deserves far more care and balanced debate than it usually attracts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n__EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marriage Fitness: 4 Steps to Building & Maintaining Phenomenal Love","description":"Revolutionary step by step system marriage success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2GADAAAACAAJ&dq=Marriage+Fitness:+4+Steps+to+Building&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":".NET Development Security Solutions","description":"The .NET Framework offers new, more effective ways to secure your Web and LAN-based applications. .NET Development Security Solutions uses detailed, code-intensive examples lots of them to teach you the right techniques for most scenarios you're likely to encounter.

One day, two thieves arrived in town pretending to be weavers who knew how to make the most beautiful and sophisticated fabrics, which had the marvellous property of only being visible to those who did their job well.. It was the perfect offer for our king, who immediately placed an order. Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) was a Danish author, poet and artist.

His books have been translated into every living language, and today there is no child or adult that has not met Andersen's whimsical characters. His fairy tales have been adapted to stage and screen countless times, most notably by Disney with the animated films \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in 1989 and \\"Frozen\\", which is loosely based on \\"The Snow Queen\\", in 2013.

Its chapters are organized into sections that cover a broad range of topics related to advances in our understanding of normal and abnormal frontal lobe functions. Part 1 introduces frontal lobe dysfunction as a common pathway leading to social and occupational disability, arguing that our aging population with its decline in executive cognitive abilities mandates corresponding eligibility and treatment changes in public and private health disability policies. Part 2 delineates the anatomy and neurochemistry of the extended frontal systems underlying neuropsychiatric illness, including colorful illustrations of three key prefrontal-subcortical circuits; a description of the functional anatomy of the orbitofrontal cortex and its relationship to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); the intricate pharmacology of working memory systems and how they apply to schizophrenia; the lateralization of prefrontal cognitive functions; and a framework for understanding the role played by the prefrontal cortex in consciousness and self-awareness. Part 3 clarifies the overused diagnosis \\"frontal lobe syndrome\\" seen in clinical practice, identifying three prefrontal syndromes for further study -- dorsolateral dysexecutive syndrome, orbitofrontal disinhibited syndrome, and mesial frontal apathetic syndrome -- that align with the anatomical systems described in Part 2 of this volume. Also included are common problems -- and suggested solutions -- in diagnosis and treatment, a practical overview of the assessment of frontal lobe functions with guidelines for bedside and formal neuropsychological examination, and comprehensive treatment strategies. Part 4 covers the role of the frontal lobes in major neuropsychiatric illnesses, discussing evidence that shows prefrontal and anterior temporal hypometabolism in primary and secondary depression; reviewing anatomical, imaging, and neurochemical studies in schizophrenia; describing the neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric sequelae of closed head injury; summarizing the neurological substrates related to interesting and often dramatic cases of content-specific delusions; and concluding with a report on the stereotactic neurosurgical treatment of refractory OCD and its implications for understanding frontal lobe function. This remarkable work is intended for psychiatrists, neurologists, psychologists, basic and clinical neuroscientists, and trainees from each of these disciplines, who will welcome it as a valuable tool in understanding the complexities of what was once considered the terra incognita of the brain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=886cQkUFjMgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bone Garden","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"To Lhasa in Disguise (Adventure Travel Classics)","description":"There were two Asian lands forbidden to Westerners in the early twentieth century. The region of the sacred Muslim cities of Mecca and Medina was well known for being off-limits. The second was Tibet, located high up on the roof of the world. This windswept, snow-covered Himalayan kingdom was the home of the Dalai Lama, the living reincarnation of the Buddha. Hidden behind stony mountains and a phalanx of xenophobic warrior monks, the high Lama resided in his isolated realm, serenely cut off from the outside world. Yet erect an obstacle and human beings will endeavor to get around it. Secretive Tibet was no different. A number of foreigners tried to get to Lhasa, the off-limits capital of the kingdom. They were all eventually discovered and turned back. Then in 1912 an unlikely candidate for geographic romance appeared. His name was William McGovern. He was an Oxford trained scholar, and more surprisingly, an American, for no one from that faraway country had ever attempted to beard the Tibetan lion in his den. McGovern was no ordinary Yankee traveler though. An excellent student of Tibetan culture, art, and language, he also brought a hitherto undisclosed talent in the search for Lhasa s secrets. McGovern was a scholar of Buddhist thought and prayer. It was because of this religious sympathy that Tibetan authorities grudgingly allowed the American, and his tiny caravan, to enter their country. He was ordered to go to the first border town, and stop. However as To Lhasa in Disguise explains, McGovern had no intention of stopping before he reached the forbidden city. What follows is one of the most intriguing tales of travel ever penned. McGovern made his way over dangerous mountain passes, avoided prowling Tibetan patrols, and finally reached his goal, only to be recognized and arrested. Still a vivid tale after all these years, if it is adventure and hair-raising travel you are seeking, then go no further. To Lhasa in Disguise delivers all that and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P7x5PQAACAAJ&dq=To+Lhasa+in+Disguise+(Adventure+Travel+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rodale Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Parks: Wildlife Watcher's Guide (Wildlife Watcher's Guide Series)","description":"This concise and well-researched volume has been updated with information of favorite birds and mammals, as well as animals you might not expect to find in the park.

However, most visitors are unaware of the crucial role that Hatteras played in the Civil War. The book offers a new view of Hatteras's history, interweaving historical facts, archival drawings, and current photography of how the island looks today. In addition, the book reveals the largely unknown journals of Edwin Graves Champney, a Union soldier who was stationed on Hatteras from 1862 to 1863. Champney's prose and artistic talents, along with the quotes of soldier Charles F. Johnson of the Ninth New York, shed new light on the experiences of Civil War soldiers stationed on the Outer Banks during that time. It follows the crucial maritime battles along the Outer Banks and the famous Burnsides Expedition. This is a fascinating history of how one of America's most treasured islands played a significant part in the Civil War and is a must for any reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S0ANAAAACAAJ&dq=Portrait+of+the+Past+:+The+Civil+War+on+Hatteras+Island+North+Carolina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Than Store-Bought: A Cookbook Authoritative recipes for the foods that most people never knew they could make at home.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"God of the Sparrow","description":"An illustrated rendition of the hymn asks how to praise the all-encompassing God of the sparrow, storm, rainbow, cross, and loving heart.

The Emerging Church movement, as an intentionally postmodern approach to ministry in the contemporary context, may, however, offer insights to reinterpret Christian education. This significant movement in today's church gives Christian education a new interpretive framework that is theologically located at an intersection of doxology and doctrine. In her examination of postmodern faith formation, Wendi Sargeant explores the importance of the Christian worshipping community as the most appropriate setting for Christian education. Practitioners and students will benefit from the ready-to-use teaching and learning matrix, and all those with interest in the formation of faith in themselves and others will draw much from the way Sargeant situates worship as the basis for enhancing Christian formation and ethos.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IlGUCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic Bookshelf: A Parent's Guide to Showing Growing Minds the Path to the Best Children's Literature","description":"This easy-to-use guide not only offers help on how to get your children to read, but also shows you what they sould be reading and explains why.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7jY652xiWnMC&dq=The+Magic+Bookshelf:+A+Parent%27s+Guide+to+Showing+Growing+Minds+the+Path+to+the+Best+Children%27s+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sanctuary, (Modern library of the world's best books, 61.2)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-hjcroqWQ1AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Detective: Beginning, Using Higher-Order Thinking Skills to Improve Reading Comprehension (Grades 3-4)","description":"Standards-based higher-order activities develop analysis, synthesis, and vocabulary skills reguired for exceptional reading comprehension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ynkrPQAACAAJ&dq=Reading+Detective:+Beginning,+Using+Higher-Order+Thinking+Skills+to+Improve+Reading+Comprehension+(Grades+3-4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Issunboshi (An Island Heritage Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Writer's Harbrace Handbook (with InfoTrac)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Franklin's Trading Cards (Kids Can Read)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Message of Hosea (The Bible Speaks Today)","description":"Why would God call his prophet to marry a prostitute?

Located some 40 miles south of Chicago's Loop, Park Forest was the first privately financed, completely planned community ever built in the United States. It was hailed as a \\"G.I. Town\\"-a place where veterans could find affordable housing and put down roots. From the date Park Forest was incorporated as a Village in 1949, the community has created a distinguished history for itself, and to this day many of the original residents still take an active part in Village life. Park Forest: Dreams and Challenges brings to life the accomplishments of this inspiring community, which possesses two All-America City awards for its volunteer efforts in building for the future. Featured in the book are historic images of the first regional shopping center built in the nation after the War and the largest publicly-owned swimming complex in the state. Park Forest is also home to both the highly rated Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra and the Illinois Theatre Center, a nationally known repertory company.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7w_DDAEACAAJ&dq=Park+Forest:+Dreams+and+Challenges+(IL)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agent of Byzantium","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shambhala","description":"The classic guide to enlightened living that first presented the Buddhist path of the warrior to Western readers with a new foreword and cover presentation.

As their ranks grow, home schoolers are making headlines by winning national spelling bees and excelling at elite universities. The few studies conducted suggest that homeschooled children are academically successful and remarkably well socialized. Yet we still know little about this alternative to one of society's most fundamental institutions. Beyond a vague notion of children reading around the kitchen table, we don't know what home schooling looks like from the inside. Sociologist Mitchell Stevens goes behind the scenes of the homeschool movement and into the homes and meetings of home schoolers. What he finds are two very different kinds of home education--one rooted in the liberal alternative school movement of the 1960s and 1970s and one stemming from the Christian day school movement of the same era. Stevens explains how this dual history shapes the meaning and practice of home schooling today. In the process, he introduces us to an unlikely mix of parents (including fundamentalist Protestants, pagans, naturalists, and educational radicals) and notes the core values on which they agree: the sanctity of childhood and the primacy of family in the face of a highly competitive, bureaucratized society. Kingdom of Children aptly places home schoolers within longer traditions of American social activism. It reveals that home schooling is not a random collection of individuals but an elaborate social movement with its own celebrities, networks, and characteristic lifeways. Stevens shows how home schoolers have built their philosophical and religious convictions into the practical structure of the cause, and documents the political consequences of their success at doing so. Ultimately, the history of home schooling serves as a parable about the organizational strategies of the progressive left and the religious right since the 1960s.Kingdom of Children shows what happens when progressive ideals meet conventional politics, demonstrates the extraordinary political capacity of conservative Protestantism, and explains the subtle ways in which cultural sensibility shapes social movement outcomes more generally.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lOOH21vRQRgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The white-magic book","description":"A mysterious book with a mysterious past, first published in 1919, The White Magic Book serves up answers to life's daily questions. \\"This book,\\" Farber writes in the Introduction, \\"is your personal, portable shrine, twenty-four-hour medium, and in it is the answer to your every question.

They seemed like the perfect couple young, good-looking, made for each other. The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother s grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married. Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition. Throughout, as each of the competing voices bears witness, we are drawn ever more fully into the complex entanglements of family life in this wise, embracing, and deeply perceptive novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q-8QBwAAQBAJ&dq=Amateur+Marriage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to be Healthy with Yoga","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beauty And The Brain (Blame It On Bob) (Desire #1130)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lieutenant Who Never Was","description":"Reproduction of the original: The Man Without a Country and Other Tales by Edward E.

He's fed by a local cafe owner, he earns some cash as a barrow-boy in Covent Garden, and sleeping in the Underground air-raid shelters is cosy - if a bit smelly. Things get more complicated for Bill with the arrival of Julie. She's a runaway too, and although she's a bit posh, she's just as determined as Bill to stay free of interfering parents and 'the social'. But although it's fun for a while to duck Jerry missiles and camp out in bombed-out houses, the reality of living through the Blitz quickly begins to set in. Winter is coming, and Bill and Julie will discover that playing at being grown-ups can be a very dangerous game....

Beyond the horrific violence inflicted on these individuals, lynching terrorized whole communities and became a defining characteristic of Southern race relations in the Jim Crow era. As spectacle, lynching was intended to serve as a symbol of white supremacy. Yet, Jonathan Markovitz notes, the act's symbolic power has endured long after the practice of lynching has largely faded away.Legacies of Lynching examines the evolution of lynching as a symbol of racial hatred and a metaphor for race relations in popular culture, art, literature, and political speech. Markovitz credits the efforts of the antilynching movement with helping to ensure that lynching would be understood not as a method of punishment for black rapists but as a terrorist practice that provided stark evidence of the brutality of Southern racism and as America's most vivid symbol of racial oppression. Cinematic representations of lynching, from Birth of a Nation to Do the Right Thing, he contends, further transform the ways that American audiences remember and understand lynching, as have disturbing recent cases in which alleged or actual acts of racial violence reconfigured stereotypes of black criminality. Markovitz further reveals how lynching imagery has been politicized in contemporary society with the example of Clarence Thomas, who condemned the Senate's investigation into allegations of sexual harassment during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings as a \\"high-tech lynching.\\"Even today, as revealed by the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and the national soul-searching it precipitated, lynching continues to pervade America's collective memory. Markovitz concludes with an analysis of debates about a recent exhibition of photographs of lynchings, suggesting again how lynching as metaphor remains always in the background of our national discussions of race and racial relations.Jonathan Markovitz is a lecturer in sociology at the University of California, San Diego.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uBn6uqufGOEC&dq=Legacies+Of+Lynching:+Racial+Violence+And+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sugaring","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lexicon of Comicana","description":"Written as a satire on the comic devices cartoonists use, the book quickly became a textbook for art students.

At this party are fifty guests, all of whom live in or have traveled extensively through these countries. Among this eclectic and well-versed group of connoisseurs are authors of acclaimed guidebooks, popular newspaper columnists and pioneering adventurers. As the evening passes, they tell you tales from their lives in these exotic places. They whisper the names of their favorite shops and restaurants; they divulge the secret hideaways where they sneak off to for an afternoon (or a weekend) to unwind. Some make you laugh out loud, and others mesmerize you with their poetry and lyricism. Some are intent on educating, while others just want to entertain. Their attitudes are as unique as their personalities, but they are united in one thing ... their love of the region. If you can envision being welcomed at such a party, then you can envision the experience that this guidebook aspires to give you. Within these pages you will find tips for adventuring, eating, shopping, and sightseeing from savvy expatriates, seasoned travelers, and inspired locals. Unlike the typical guidebook, To Asia With Love does not offer a comprehensive overview, but instead presents selected recommendations in the form of personal essays and tidbits, each of which is paired with a practical fact file. Discover the benefits of carrying a baseball glove in Laos, go bird watching in the Thai everglades, take a motorbike into the Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia, and immerse yourself in modern art in Vietnam. In addition, one chapter focuses solely on opportunities for giving back to the countries you visit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YUqsbJDplYcC&dq=To+Asia+with+Love:+A+Connoisseurs%27+Guide+to+Cambodia,+Laos,+Thailand+and+Vietnam.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visions Across the Americas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-8VHvo4TeoC&dq=Visions+Across+the+Americas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time of My Life","description":"One half of the Righteous Brothers describes his life, from entering amateur singing contests, his R&B influences, to pioneering the  blue-eyed soul  group whose  You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'  was named as the most-played song of the twentieth century. 40,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&dq=Time+of+My+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"England, 1870-1914","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A-U4MQAACAAJ&dq=England,+1870-1914&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russian Stage 2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Baking Technology: Breadmaking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The First Rumpole Omnibus","description":"The irrepressible English barrister, Horace Rumpole, seeks to uncover the truth behind a variety of unusual cases of crime","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uc1AAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+First+Rumpole+Omnibus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speaking of Hillary : A Readers' Guide to the Most Controversial Woman in America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Penrod and Sam","description":"Newton Booth Tarkington (18691946) was an American dramatist and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist. Among only three other novelists to have won the Pulitzer Prize more than once, Tarkington was one of the greatest authors of the 1910s and 1920s who helped usher in Indiana's Golden Age of literature. First published in 1916, Tarkington's novel  Penrod and Sam  is the second installment to \\"The Penrod Series\\" and concentrates on the relationship between Penrod Schofield and his best friend, Sam Williams. A charming tale of youth reminiscent of Mark Twain's  Huckleberry Finn  that will not disappoint fans of Tarkington's wonderful work.

Do the future gains of putting money in a pension fund outweigh going to Hawaii for New Year's Eve? Why does a person's self-discipline one day often give way to impulsive behavior the next? Time and Decision takes up these questions with a comprehensive collection of new research on intertemporal choice, examining how people face the problem of deciding over time. Economists approach intertemporal choice by means of a model in which people discount the value of future events at a constant rate. A vacation two years from now is worth less to most people than a vacation next week. Psychologists, on the other hand, have focused on the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of intertemporal choice. Time and Decision draws from both disciplinary approaches to provide a comprehensive picture of the various layers of choice involved. Shane Frederick, George Loewenstein, and Ted O'Donoghue introduce the volume with an overview of the research on time discounting and focus on how people actually discount the future compared to the standard economic model. Alex Kacelnik discusses the crucial role that the ability to delay gratification must have played in evolution. Walter Mischel and colleagues review classic research showing that four year olds who are able to delay gratification subsequently grow up to perform better in college than their counterparts who chose instant gratification. The book also delves into the neurobiology of patience, examining the brain structures involved in the ability to withstand an impulse. Turning to the issue of self-control, Klaus Wertenbroch examines the relationship between consumption and available resources, showing, for example, how a high credit limit can lead people to overspend. Ted O'Donoghue and Matthew Rabin show how people's awareness of their self-control problems affects their decision-making. The final section of the book examines intertemporal choice with regard to health, drug addiction, dieting, marketing, savings, and public policy. All of us make important decisions every day-many of which profoundly affect the quality of our lives. Time and Decision provides a fascinating look at the complex factors involved in how and why we make our choices, so many of them short-sighted, and helps us understand more precisely this crucial human frailty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tAOGAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Auditing: A Risk Analysis Approach","description":"Utilizing a unique, risk analysis approach to auditing, Konrath's 5e emphasizes auditor identification of risk factors and the allocation of audit resources to high-risk areas.

Based on Gabor Mat  s two decades of experience as a medical doctor and his groundbreaking work with the severely addicted on Vancouver s skid row, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts radically reenvisions this much misunderstood field by taking a holistic approach. Dr. Mat  presents addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout (and perhaps underpins) our society; not a medical \\"condition\\" distinct from the lives it affects, rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional, and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs (and behaviors) of addiction. Simplifying a wide array of brain and addiction research findings from around the globe, the book avoids glib self-help remedies, instead promoting a thorough and compassionate self-understanding as the first key to healing and wellness. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts argues persuasively against contemporary health, social, and criminal justice policies toward addiction and those impacted by it. The mix of personal stories including the author s candid discussion of his own \\"high-status\\" addictive tendencies and science with positive solutions makes the book equally useful for lay readers and professionals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Oew75Hp8XP4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The works of Robert Browning,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sea Assault: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","description":"New York Times Bestseller The final volume of the magisterial Pacific War Trilogy from acclaimed historian Ian W.

No tactical masterstroke or blunder could reverse the increasingly lopsided balance of power between the two combatants. The War in the Pacific had entered its endgame. Beginning with the Honolulu Conference, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with his Pacific theater commanders to plan the last phase of the campaign against Japan, Twilight of the Gods brings to life the harrowing last year of World War II in the Pacific, when the U.S. Navy won the largest naval battle in history; Douglas MacArthur made good his pledge to return to the Philippines; waves of kamikazes attacked the Allied fleets; the Japanese fought to the last man on one island after another; B-29 bombers burned down Japanese cities; and Hiroshima and Nagasaki were vaporized in atomic blasts. Ian W. Toll s narratives of combat in the air, at sea, and on the beaches are as gripping as ever, but he also reconstructs the Japanese and American home fronts and takes the reader into the halls of power in Washington and Tokyo, where the great questions of strategy and diplomacy were decided. Drawing from a wealth of rich archival sources and new material, Twilight of the Gods casts a penetrating light on the battles, grand strategic decisions and naval logistics that enabled the Allied victory in the Pacific. An authoritative and riveting account of the final phase of the War in the Pacific, Twilight of the Gods brings Toll s masterful trilogy to a thrilling conclusion. This prize-winning and best-selling trilogy will stand as the first complete history of the Pacific War in more than twenty-five years, and the first multivolume history of the Pacific naval war since Samuel Eliot Morison s series was published in the 1950s.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CLC6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"five-finger discount","description":"Now a PBS documentary, this astonishing memoir of growing up in rough-and-tumble Jersey City  will steal your heart  (People) With deadpan humor and obvious affection, Five-Finger Discount recounts the story of an unforgettable New Jersey family of swindlers, bookies, embezzlers, and mobster-wannabes. In the memoir Mary Karr calls  a page-turner,  Helene Stapinski ingeniously weaves the checkered history of her hometown of Jersey City a place known for its political corruption and industrial blight with the tales that have swirled around her relatives for decades. Navigating a childhood of toxic waste and tough love, Stapinski tells an extraordinary tale at once heartbreaking and hysterically funny. Praise for Five-Finger Discount  By turns hilarious and alarming, [Helene Stapinski s] book reads on the surface like something by Damon Runyon and Elmore Leonard, with a dark undertow of real-life pain and disillusion.  Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times  It s a brilliant book, a darling book. It is the blessedly modest chronicle of a magical consciousness that seems to have been born pulling diamonds out of the muck, hearing angels  voices in the fiercest thunder. . . . I adored every word of this wondrous book. Get it. Read it.  Michael Pakenham, The Baltimore Sun  In the tradition of . . . Rita Mae Brown and Amy Tan, Ms. Stapinski is an exciting writer, unabashedly candid, and at the same time unashamedly self-contained. Five-Finger Discount is a must-read.

First, this book is about the way software engineering is done in practice. Second, it is about software engineering for enterprise applications. ?Enterprise applications include payroll, patient records, shipping tracking, cost analysis, credit scoring, insurance, supply chain, accounting, customer service, and foreign exchange trading. Enterprise applications don?t include automobile fuel injection, word processors, elevator controllers, chemical plant controllers, telephone switches, operating systems, compilers, and games.? (Fowler, 2003, p.3). The book is pivoted on one main case-study, a large number of supporting examples, and end-of-chapter problem-solving exercises consisting of case-study exercises and minicases. A particular organization that the case-study, problem-solving exercises and most examples are derived from is a company specializing in advertising expenditure measurement. The book endeavors to give broad software engineering knowledge and to provide background information prior to presenting case-study solutions. However, a distinguishing emphasis of the book is to concentrate on support skills for system design and programming. For given requirements, the book iteratively develops design and implementation models. Case-study, examples and problem-solving exercises are carefully selected to emphasize various aspects of software development as necessitated by unique characteristics of different applications and target software solutions. The book consists of four parts. Part A (Software projects) discusses software lifecycle, software engineering tools, project planning, budgeting and scheduling, project quality, risk management, and change management. The next three parts (B, C, and D) concentrate on methods, techniques, processes, and development environments of software engineering. The case-study, examples and problem-solving exercises are based on the experience gained from a large ACNielsen project. For pedagogical reasons, industrial problems and solutions have been simplified and re-implemented specifically for the purpose of the book. Occasionally, for comparative purposes, more than one programming environment has been used in presented solutions. All programming code, including code not presented in the text, is available on the book?s website. The code is mostly Java accessing Oracle database.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d9lzQgAACAAJ&dq=Practical+Software+Engineering:+A+Case-Study+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morbid Taste for Bones","description":"The  irresistible  and  compelling  first novel in the historical mystery series featuring a Welsh Benedictine monk in the twelfth century (The Washington Post). A Welsh Benedictine monk living at Shrewsbury Abbey in western England, Brother Cadfael spends much of his time tending the herbs and vegetables in the garden but now there s a more pressing matter. Cadfael is to serve as translator for a group of monks heading to the town of Gwytherin in Wales. The team s goal is to collect the holy remains of Saint Winifred, which Prior Robert hopes will boost the abbey s reputation, as well as his own. But when the monks arrive in Gwytherin, the town is divided over the request. When the leading opponent to disturbing the grave is found shot dead with a mysterious arrow, some believe Saint Winifred herself delivered the deadly blow. Brother Cadfael knows an earthly hand did the deed, but his plan to root out a murderer may dig up more than he can handle. Before CSI and Law & Order, there was Brother Cadfael,  wily veteran of the Crusades  (Los Angeles Times). His knowledge of herbalism, picked up in the Holy Land, and his skillful observance of human nature are blessings in dire situations, and earned Ellis Peters a Crime Writers  Association Silver Dagger Award. A Morbid Taste for Bones kicks off a long-running and much-loved series that went on to be adapted for stage, radio, and television.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zI4IBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Road Rage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Practical Railway Engineering","description":"This textbook covers the very wide spectrum of all aspects of railway engineering for all engineering disciplines, in a 'broad brush' way giving a good overall knowledge of what is involved in planning, designing, constructing and maintaining a railway.

In this book you will visit sites like Sandberg's famous Summit Hotel where you would have seen Cadillacs, Packards and Studebakers during the road's heyday; the former site of the opulent Hotel Lebec, playground for the world's finest; the Ridge Road House; the National Forest Inn; and Kelly's Half Way House. Motorists faced 697 curves when navigating this famous moutain highway. You will follow \\"Ridge Route Annie's\\" adventurous search for gold. Read how highwaymen relieved unsuspecting motorists of their valuables and the 1922 blizzard that stranded scores of motorists. All of this in addition to early history on north - south routes and how Los Angeles had to entice the Butterfield Stage and later the Southern Pacific Railroad in Los Angeles.

(Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","description":"The real Timon of Athens lived there in the fifth century BCE, making him a contemporary of Socrates and Pericles. Shakespeare presents Timon as a figure who suffers such profound disillusionment that he becomes a misanthrope, or man-hater. This makes him a more interesting character than the caricature he had become to Shakespeare s contemporaries, for whom  Timonist  was a slang term for an unsociable man. Shakespeare s play includes the wealthy, magnificent, and extravagantly generous figure of Timon before his transformation. Timon expects that, having received as gifts all that he owned, his friends will be equally generous to him. Once his creditors clamor for repayment, Timon finds that his idealization of friendship is an illusion. He repudiates his friends, abandons Athens, and retreats to the woods. Yet his misanthropy arises from the destruction of an admirable illusion, from which his subsequent hatred can never be entirely disentangled. The authoritative edition of Timon of Athens from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by Copp lia Kahn The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world s largest collection of Shakespeare s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Del knows all of this because she's a Walker, someone who can navigate between the worlds, and whose job is to keep the dimensions in harmony. But Del's decisions have consequences too. And when she secretly starts to investigate other dissonant worlds she's intrigued by the echo versions of Simon Lane, a guy who won't give her the time of day in the main world, but whose alternate selves are uniquely interested.

In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed between two ice floes. With no options left, Shackleton and a skeleton crew attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. Their survival, and the survival of the men they left behind, depended on their small lifeboat successfully finding the island of South Georgia--a tiny dot of land in a vast and hostile ocean. In Endurance, the definitive account of Ernest Shackleton's fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing and miraculous voyage that has defined heroism for the modern age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_YxttAEACAAJ&dq=Endurance:+Shackleton%27s+incredible+voyage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Waiting Years","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hardcastle's Spy (Hardcastle Mysteries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Medieval World - Internet Linked (World History (Usborne))","description":"Introduces the highlights of medieval history and society throughout the world, from the Byzantine Empire to the explorers of the late fifteenth century, with links to the Internet for further information.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DtRKPgAACAAJ&dq=Medieval+World+-+Internet+Linked+(World+History+(Usborne))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saint Benedict's Rule","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Impulse: Reckless Youth","description":"Bart Allen, the superhero grandson of the original Flash, must learn to curb his reckless tendencies after he is transported from the thirtieth century where he was born and raised to twentieth-century Alabama.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3iqEPQAACAAJ&dq=Impulse:+Reckless+Youth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clifford The Big Red Dog: The Missing Beach Ball","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Art of Rock Skipping: How, Where, and Why to Skip","description":"Some of life's most rewarding activities are the simplest.

We know some of the answers, because half of George Armstrong Custer s Seventh Cavalry - the men with Major Marcus Reno and Captain Frederick Benteen - survived the fight, but what of the half that did not, the troopers, civilians, scouts, and journalist who were with Custer? Now, because a grass fire in August 1983 cleared the terrain of brush and grass and made possible thorough archaeological examinations of the battlefield in 1984 and 1985, we have many answers to important questions. On the basis of the archaeological evidence presented in this book, we know more about what kinds of weapons were used against the cavalry. We know exactly where many of the men fought, how they died, and what happened to their bodies at the time of or after death. We know how the troopers were deployed, what kind of clothing they wore, what kind of equipment they had, how they fought. Through the techniques of historical archaeology and forensic anthropology, the remains and grave of one of Custer s scouts, Mitch Boyer, have been identified. And through geomorphology and the process of elimination, we know with almost 100 percent certainty where the twenty-eight missing men who supposedly were buried en masse in Deep Ravine will be found.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RuiGG2rv1TAC&dq=Archaeological+Perspectives+on+the+Battle+of+the+Little+Bighorn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wilder Shores of Love","description":"Ideal reading for anyone looking for adventure and romance in unusual settings.

It takes world-city and world-history literatures to a higher level of depth and understanding. It is difficult to imagine a more pioneering, in-depth study of world cities.\\" Ramon Grosfoguel, Professor, Department of Ethnic Studies, University of California, Berkeley \\"A remarkable and original discussion of three great sacred cities across time, and their transformation by nationalism in the modern world.\\" Immanuel Wallerstein, Yale University Far from spawning an age of tolerance, modernity has created the social basis of division and exclusion. This book elaborates this provocative claim as it explores the rich but divided histories of three cities located at the crossroads of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Many observers presume that violence is built into these sacred cities because their citizens cling to religious or cultural ideals of some archaic age; only when this history is overcome can citizens enter a new age of brotherhood. Samman persuades us to refocus our attention on modernity, which has instilled troubling dilemmas from the outside. He shows how these sacred places long ago entered the modern world where global political and economic forces exacerbate nationalism and regional divisions. If we are to resolve deep conflicts we must re-imagine the institutional basis on which modernity, rather than religion, is built.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FzweCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Rand: A Designer\`s Art","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The New Dealers' War: Fdr And The War Within World War Ii","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Management of A Sales Force","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BH6wAAAAIAAJ&dq=Management+of+A+Sales+Force&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For Self and Country: For the Wounded in Vietnam the Journey Home Took More Courage Than Going into Battle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Collected Writings of W.E.

Your daily routine burns thousands of calories, playing in the street every minute your parents allow, imitating your favorite players from your local sports teams. But while the games are fun to watch, your teams are not so good, at least not good enough to raise a trophy at the end of the season. Then it all changes, when not one but three underdog teams chase-and catch-glory. Fantasy movie script? No, this was very real. Framed by the first lunar landing, the legendary Woodstock festival, the tragedies of the Vietnam War, and the tribulations of Catholic school, this funny and nostalgic chronicle written through the eyes of a ten-year-old enthusiastically recounts the high emotions of this special year in the history of the country. It reveals the closeness and camaraderie that shined through in all aspects of family and community life. The Wonder Year transports the reader to a place that for some is long forgotten, but can now be fondly remembered-and to a time that in some ways was very simple, but simultaneously extraordinary. It captures the spirit of the times: the family values, neighborhood friendships, the common and comfortable rituals, the shared experiences. In short, 1969 was nothing short of The Wonder Year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dI1kswEACAAJ&dq=Fieldbook+For+Boys+and+Men,+1969+Printing+Thus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Key Confrontations (2nd in the Italian Renaissance Series)","description":"The third edition of this popular reader reflects considerable changes.
