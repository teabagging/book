It is enjoyable and educational, and you can't ask for much more than that. Of course, Mencken allows his fulsome personality free rein, and hypersensitive, humorless, religious, and/or idealistic folks may be put off.

It is the first of the dozen or so books that I have read by Mencken, but still my favorite. Mencken has opened up a whole new world for me. His irreverent debunking of favorite quacks have prompted me to look anew at a few of my own. His incredible knowledge of the English language has raised the standards I expect others to meet, not a little. And my vicarious contact with his world has made me work to improve my own.Mencken, I am convinced, was a genius whose writings will live long even into the next century. His writing is the only one that I feel compelled to read aloud to my wife, arms raised in excitement and for emphasis, daring her to contradict the glory of his prose.What contemporary American writer can match his mastery? I've read a lot, but I can't give even an approximation. His style is elegant, distinctively American, and a joy to read. Something like listening to a singer who you know has an absolute control of her material, a voice that does exactly what she intends, and the aesthetic sense of an angel."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"Since Mencken was writing at the turn of the Century, some of these brief essays are a bit dated (duh!), but still well written and quite clever.

Lincoln was America's first dictator A man who \\"knew\\" that he had to destroy freedom to save it from its excesses. Mencken's pen is like Luke Skywalker's light saber in eviscerating the likes of Lincoln, yet he devotes equal attention to the sheepish masses who elect these swine.

Perhaps, however he used his influence to get black writer's work into leading publications at a time when no one else did.Gibbons Burke on Mencken:The most prominent newspaperman, book reviewer, and political commentator of his day, Henry Louis Mencken was a libertarian before the word came into usage. His prose is as clear as an azure sky, and his rhetoric as deadly as a rifle shot. Frequent targets of his lance were Franklin Roosevelt and New Deal politics, Comstocks, hygenists, \\"uplifters\\", social reformers of any stripe, boobs & quacks, and the insatiable American appetite for nonsense and gaudy sham.

Even Mencken's ghost can do it, and has.

Along with that, came a couple of biographies, one by Hobson and one by Teachout.I've read both biographies and made my way through about half of this self-collected work. It boggles the mind that Mencken had (or had he?) the impact that he was supposed to have had during the 1910s through 1930s.He was wa racist and a bigot. Many of the pieces in Chrestomathy are culled from his \\"Prejudices\\" series. Prejudice implies having some experience to base an opinion on. Here is a man who rarely set foot outside of Baltimore, except for regular trips to NYC to meet with his publisher. He said pretty nasty things about Jews (despite Knopf, his publisher and alleged friend, being one), and blacks (at one point claiming that the only intelligent blacks were those who had some white blood introduced by the massa during the good old days of slavery). He lived at home with mom and his siblings until she died, and lived in the same house except for a five year period when he was married (in his 50s). Oh, he did visit Germany a few times -- his family was of German origin and Mencken seemed to have the idea that the master race was reflected in himself - this boozy, narrow-minded fireplug of a man.Not having a basis in fact for many of his prejudices, that leaves him a bigot. He was ignorant. He was smarmy and thought himself (and those like him) better than just about everybody. He wrote nasty things about his \\"friends.\\"So, why is everybody interested in what he has to say? He was considered an iconoclast because he wrote what he thought. But once the shock value is gone, all that is left is some great writing (vocabulary, grammar, style) with some crappy content. What he thought might have reflected his times, but my sense is that his times were really the last 1900s, not even the times when he wrote."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"H. L. Mencken is perhaps (along with many of the adherents who pay him more attention than he deserves) the responsible for the creation of the figure known today as \\"intellectual snob\\", a person who merely devotes his existence to judge the work of others and who deems himself equally important (or even superior) to the own writers.I have always thought that this pathetic guy had a recurrent wet dream in which he imagined that he was the author of \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\". Unfortunately for him, Ambrose Bierce was one and only. Bad luck, Mr. Mencken.His taste in literature was nothing out of the ordinary and left something to be desired, as shown by his appreciation of a repellent racist troglodyte like Jack London and other mediocre authors. He even dared to say that Bierce's experimental fictions were useless; this last judgement being quite paradoxical, if we take into account that Mencken always ludicrously tried to imitate Bierce's mordant style for his own sake.Who cares about this Mencken? He never wrote fiction. He's just a critic... Why bother reading his out-dated and erroneous assessments and his insufferable mental diarrhoea? You'd better be spending your time in real literature and learning to draw your own conclusions about it (I know it's difficult, but you can do it if you try).

I did not know what the heck a chrestomathy was, but it seemed to refer to books that were very large. As a Southerner, I resented Mencken's Sahara of the Bozart, and resented it all the more for the truth of it. But I figured that any man who admired James Branch Cabell couldn't be all that evil. After all, I had been born in Richmond and Cabell was from Richmond, so any friend of Cabell's was a friend of mine. On once again reading the Sahara of the Bozart (it had taken me some time to get the beaux arts pun), I am struck by the blatant racism of his mocking references to smaller European countries, such as Albania. But in those days there was no political correctness, and he would have lunged at it like a hyena if it had existed. I was disturbed by his vicious attitude about the death of William Jennings Bryan, who was guilty of attacking evolution. He was a mortal foe of Prohibition, inhibition and every other breed of 'bition that you can think of.

Since I am one of HLM's greatest scholars and admirer, I keep three or four copies of \\"A MENCKEN CHRESTOMATHY\\" around for people who seem to take an interest in the greatest American writer of any century. Mencken says things that I and a lot of people have thought but cannot put into words. (Whoever has my first edition, please return it!)I was overwhelmed by the insightful and honesty of his comments about almost everybody in American life: The Husbandman (farmer), The Physician (Is he a real Medical Doctor or a Hygienist), The Pedagogue (Who's the best teacher you ever had?), the politician (the only work he does is to get re-elected) and much more.

A cynical contrarian and what we might today refer to as a Libertarian he was definitely not possessed of the need to adher to \\"politicaly correct\\" opinions. Hence, his writings will probably not warm the cockles of a Liberal's heart. But, then again, they might benefit from some exposure to enlightment.With a firm grasp of the English language and a fitting vocabulary, Mencken will send poorly educated college graduate illiberals scrambling for their dictionaries.Penned to reflect the nature of his times, his observations are as germane to today's conditions as they were 80-years ago.For a reader unfamilar with Mencken, this annonated collection of essays is an excellent start towards the comprehension of tolerance and critical thinking."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"Mencken's writings will appall the politically correct and delight those who enjoy masterful English prose. I started this book by choosing an essay at random, and luck must have been with me on that memorable day, for the essay was \\"In Memoriam: WJB.\\" That particular gem was my introduction to this inimitable writer, and I've been fascinated with him since.Of course, it is impossible to write a review of a Mencken-authored volume without mentioning some of his questionable views on race and class divisions. But readers ought to hesitate before condemning his unpalatable verdicts on Jews, Armenians, Poles, Greeks (and so on), for Mencken, what with his all-consuming contempt for Homo Sapiens, was willing (nay, eager!) to go after ANY group with his formidable pen. And remember, too, that good writing is not the sole domain of the morally upright. Mencken was certainly not that, and yet his style surpassed the ramblings of many of his kinder contemporaries.

M. Montgomery's novels in the Anne of Green Gables series, which does not mean it is not a first-rate novel. For me, I guess it was a bit anticlimactic for Anne and Gilbert to finally get married. But then I read the books in the order they are numbered and not the order in which Montgomery wrote them, in which case I would have skipped \\"Anne of Windy Poplars\\" and would therefore not have been bothered by all that time between the engagement and the wedding as Anne waits three years for Gilbert to complete his medical degree.The newlyweds move into their House of Dreams at Four Winds Harbour and start their life together. For the first time Anne is more of an observer than a participant, as the two main characters of the book turn out to be the storytelling Captain Jim the local lighhouse keeper and the tragic but romantic figure of Leslie Moore. Comic relief is provided by the audacious Miss Cornelia, who is most decidedly in the Rachely Lynde mode. The most fascinating part of the novel for me is that the only way you can tell Anne is about to have a baby is that she stops going outside and Marilla shows up for a visit (and I have to admit I was shocked, shocked I tell you, that her son's first name is James rather than Matthew!). Perhaps no other aspect of Montgomery's work gives us as good an indication that she is writing about another time. Forutnately, once you know the code you can be quicker to pick up the hints in the future.There is a sense in which \\"Anne's House of Dreams\\" is the last real L.M. Montgomery story about Anne Shirley. Obviously that is true just because her name is now Anne Blythe, but after this novel the emphasis will be more on Anne's children and their young friends than our beloved red-haired orphan. Consequently, \\"Anne's House of Dreams\\" is very much a transitional book in the series. It is nice to say that if this is the \\"low\\" point in the series, other writers should be so lucky with their high points. Given Montgomery's own marriage, which turned out to have more than its share of problems, having her write a story of a happily married couple has an additional level of poignancy."},{"Title":"SAS, the Illustrated History","review":"Barry Davies now one of the biggest Authors of SAS history and Tactics, etc. etc. Has written this book well using a personal and outside source of photos he accuratelly retells the history of the SAS. So if you admire or just have heard about the SAS you should purchase this Book. SAS: The Illustrated History. By Barry Davies"},{"Title":"SAS, the Illustrated History","review":"Ordinarily, one might expect a great deal of celebrated information from a work entitled; \\"SAS - The Illustrated History.\\" Regrettably, this book is no more than a big disappointment because \\"an illustrated history\\" it is not.This is a collection of photographs. Whilst some may be historic, the vast majority are the property of one man and were taken throughout his own service with 22 SAS Regiment. Yes, plenty of blurred faces here, but once that simple fact is explained (and it is!), it automatically follows that the majority of this book covers the author's own service with the briefest possible mention of those elements which were beyond his experience.With no Index, there is little chance of finding anything specific without trawling through every word. Having said that, such a search will not take long. The first chapter, for example, is entitled \\"The Early Years\\" and purports to cover the regiment's history to 1972. Condensed into 20 pages - most of which comprise one or two photographs (with or without brief) captions and plenty of blank spaces, there really isn't any detail to speak of.There is a shipwreck close inshore off southern Cyprus which the Royal Navy will insist is simply not there! One of the many suggestions as to how her presence in Cyprus might be explained, is that she was acquired by the SAS in the latter stages of the war and used in clandestine operations after (or even during!) which she came to be wrecked where she is found today. Sadly, this book fails to mention that particular aspect of SAS operations at all.In addition, I also have reason to doubt the factual accuracy of some of the content. When I left 22 SAS in late 1971, elements of the regiment were fighting a little-known war in Muscat and Oman. A very dear friend, who was one of the Fijian members of the regiment, drove me to the station in an open desert Landrover. It was his way of saying farewell. He was a giant of a man who died heroically in Oman just a few weeks later. I am quite certain that was in February 1972 but here his death is recorded as July. Perhaps I have been wrong all these years... Furthermore, however, at that time in our military history, the only honours that could be bestowed posthumously were either the Victoria Cross or the Mention in Despatches (MID). My good friend Corporal Labalaba from Fiji received the latter whereas in this thinly researched work he is shown as having received the British Empire Medal (BEM). In 1979, I actually met Lab's sister in Fiji and have also seen a framed poster in 2 Para Sergeants Mess - and both those sources referred to his MID!In summary, we have a collection of photographs supported by dubious research padded out with plenty of blank spaces (often half a page!) to produce a work which is wholly reliant on the three letters \\"SAS\\" to sell copies. There is little or nothing to be learned from reading the book which might have been better described as a \\"magazine for boys.\\"NM"},{"Title":"SAS, the Illustrated History","review":"But besides very good photographs of the SAS in action, this book also contains quite a good description of the history and current activities of the SAS.

It looks like a Master's degree thesis written at a graduate university program in Chess (tho it is a lively read). It is a testament to the brain power and hard work of its authors.The key to this book is its *progressive* teaching approach. KRP v. KR positions are discussed first. The pawn is discussed on an edge column like 'h', then on 'g', then 'f', then 'e'. Then the pawn is discussed on an early row like '4', then '5', '6', '7'.Then KRPP v. KRP positions are discussed, with part of the discussion focused on how to *reduce* to a winning KRP v. KR position studied earlier.The material is both advanced and not. It does go into extreme detail, but I never had any difficulty understanding the reasons for the moves, after I read the authors' explanations. So in that sense the material is not advanced. Yet there is so much detail, the kind grandmasters need to know, that I could never hope to remember it all a few weeks later. That is not the authors' fault, it is just the harsh truth about chess.It is fun to understand deep endgame play, if only while reading the book. Thus this book is surprisingly entertaining and fun.Perhaps the authors did not write the book for us, perhaps they wrote it for themselves, and then published it for whatever extra benefit that might bring.This book also has an excellect summary Conclusion section, with 22 rules that may stimulate our memory of the sections we read. For flavor here are excerpts for some of those summarized rules:\\"7. The possibility of sheltering the king from checks in the immediate neighbourhood of the passed pawn (the principle flight square) often determines the outcome of the game.\\"\\"10. A rook and two connected passed pawns generally win against a rook and passed pawn. If the passed pawns have reached the 6th rank there is the possibility of sacrificing the rook for the pawn, transposing into a won ending of...\\"\\"11. With two disconnected pawns against one passed pawn important roles are played by the bridge and diversion.\\"The matial in this book can only be absorbed by numerous re-readings. If the endgame is the part of chess that excites you the most, or if you are a master who works hours per day at chess, then this book could help your tournament results.For club players, this book is NOT over our heads. But for us the true purpose of buying this book is for enjoyment, and this it WILL provide. But this book is aiming for great depth in areas that might not be our highest priority, and it is demanding a lot of our time and discipline which we realistically cannot give.I have the older Descriptive (yuk) notation edition of this book. If the 2002/05/05 claims by reviewer gm_extraordinaire that the newer algebraic notation edition contains too many errors, that could be a serious problem.That problem could have been avoided by use of a more informative kind of algebraic notation, one that included the origin square. Such notation enables the reader to correct notation errors in the book. Since this book chose the nice format of displaying moves in two columns (White & Black), there is far more then enough space to include origin square info without the printer consuming any more pages.Here is the Table of Contents:English translation 1971, 224 pages, ISBN = 0 7134 04493, Descriptive (yuk) notation.Preface1.

There are two stories told: first, how the evil found and took a young woman, Christabel, for his own in colonial New York. The second story is of the modern la Christabel, supermodel, spinning out yet another life to provide the suffering that the evil thrives on.In Coleridge's version of this tale, even nature itself is evil (so green, so female), as is the witch Geraldine, who bewitches young Christabel with veiled references to lesbianism. Christabel is just a victim and the rescuer is Sir Leoline, who must fight both the witch and nature for Christabel's soul.Laura Adams turns this story upside down. Geraldine represents the peaceful, natural world of the native Manhattans, and when the young Christabel meets the native woman, passion soon follows. Their joyous happiness is discovered and fouled by a demon Puritan preacher, who contrives Geraldine's downfall. Easy to do when Halley's Comet has appeared overhead -- blame it on the nearest nonconformist female and call her a witch. As the preacher takes possession of Christabel in the past, the modern day Christa has adopted desperate measures to try to break the cycle. An investment banker, Dina has renounced the part of her heritage that has passed down over time, but one touch of Christa's hand brings the power -- and the passion -- surging back. Defeated in the past, she arms herself for another battle in this lifetime.The story weaves back and forth in time with perfect clarity. Minor characters from the past have their roles to play in the present. Even an ancient tree contributes -- significantly -- to the link between the two stories.The plot makes for a good read, and the writing is pure Kallmaker/Adams -- prose matching time period and, of course, unbelievably erotic tension between her characters. The reality of life on the island of Manhattan in the late 1600s is well researched. The resolution is electric and quite, quite satisfactory. Once you start, you won't put it down until the last page."},{"Title":"Christabel: A Novel","review":"Love can conquer anything, even time and always evil. That's the message of this book, which I could not put down.

I was completely captured by the concept and fervently pulling for these women, right to the very last page."},{"Title":"Christabel: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Night Vision so much that I ordered this book as soon as it was available. It is so different from Night Vision in subject, but the belief in lesbian magic that reaches beyond space and time is as pervasive here, as healing and as vastly enjoyable! I recommend this book to anyone who believes that love can trescend any pain and any evil."},{"Title":"Christabel: A Novel","review":"Kudos to Ms. Kallmaker for writing an intelligent and moving lesbian romance. She tells the story of two women deeply in love who must defeat an age-old evil to secure freedom and happiness. Their story is reflective of a larger struggle - the fight for women to have the rights and opportunities needed to set their own paths and live their own lives."},{"Title":"Christabel: A Novel","review":"I'd have to say I'm a big Karin Kallmaker fan, and took this book on vacation with great anticipation. I ended up somewhat disappointed in it. It's definitely not your typical fantasy-based romance where there is some type of immersion in the tale. The characters never seem to fully understand or believe what is happening to them, and for me there just wasn't enough \\"belief\\" to carry me through the book with a willing suspension of my own disbelief. It was still an interesting ride, but the author made clear choices about how quickly to reveal key information, holding back a lot of the truth of what was happening, but not providing enough context for the reader to begin to piece it together or anticipate the path to conclusion, and the disconnect I felt while reading it kept me worried until the end that everything would wrap up to my satisfaction. Fortunately all was well in the end, as I should have trusted with this author, even if there were some uncharacteristically corny moments to contend with.That's not to say that this book is without merit. I like Karin's way with words and phrasing. I like how she is able to with deft pacing of her characterizations and descriptions to create characters who strike sparks off of one another. I like her spin on Coleridge's version of the tale. Also as a gothic romance, such as this is styled to be, there were some genuinely creepy moments. The details she provides of past life on Manhattan Island are interesting, and in fact those scenes in the past are some of the most vibrant in the novel.But overall it was hard for me to stay in it. I was too annoyed with the actions and thoughts of the protagonists much of the time: their skepticism and defeatism and passiveness. Karin does an excellent job at weaving the past and present together and creating characters you want to care about, but somehow made that connection difficult to maintain by intentionally muddying their motivations until the very end. Though I have to say that all was explained satisfactorily in the end, it was a slightly uncomfortable journey. For me."},{"Title":"Christabel: A Novel","review":"I was caught by this novel right off the bat, a gothic fantasy novel that features lesbians. I'm so there. It was as good as I'd hoped. The characters are well developed, as all Kallmaker characters are, and by chapter 2 I was already in love with both Christabel and Geraldine/Dina (mostly Dina). Their joy and their suffering are palpable (I admit, I cried a little at one point). But what struck me most was what a great job Kallmaker did of smoothly moving between the past and the present, then merging them without it becoming redundant, which it easily could have. Just a fun, entertaining read with great characters, an enthralling storyline, and tight writing.I am so glad that Bella Books is re-releasing Kallmaker's Laura Adams titles (especially for people like me who didn't even know about them). I've already ordered and pre-ordered all of them. So excited!"},{"Title":"Bomba, the jungle boy (Bomba series ; no. 1)","review":"Bomba (the teenage boy this book's about) goes through many adventures on the high seas, through steaming grottos, fights dragons and all kinds of imaginary beasts.

Hunting tapirs, sleeping in thorn brushes at night for protection, encountering a new &quot;beast&quot; that apparently had eaten a few people, because Bomba could see them in its innards! Probably a &quot;Jeep-Beast&quot;...(did they have Jeeps in the thirties?) I found 15 volumes of the series in the 80s at Shepherd Mall in Oklahoma City at a open Mall sale and bought them all for $50. I was in heaven!!! The last was #18, so there were some copies missing from my newfound treasure. I let the two young boys in my family &quot;dig-in&quot; to the collection, but I held off until I could find the missing volumes and go through from start to finish. My heart was broken when the entire collection was lost (and our house!) when fire claimed most of everything in 1984. I haven't found a single volume since.

I idolized Bomba, acted out his stories in the large play-yard of our apartment complex, and dressed all my dolls as Bomba (note that I am female, which didn't stop me at all from wanting to play the Bomba role myself). When I reread one of the books as an adult, however, the racism that had gone completely over my head when I was a child was very obvious. There are descriptions, for example, of the souls of the white characters being \\"awake,\\" while the souls of the dark-skinned natives are \\"asleep.\\" The racism was so pervasive that as an adult it disturbs me, and I wouldn't give these books to a child now without considerable explanation.

I found the story in a book called &quot;Popular Stories for Boys&quot; dated 1926. I thought maybe the stories would be less politically correct and more manly and adventuresome than are currently written. Wow - was I right! Bomba is the most exciting book we have read in a long time. We LOVE it! I am thinking that this is the reading fare that the World War II generation grew up on. They read about courage in the face of horrible danger and then they went out and demonstrated it. I want my son to know that kind of courage and character that Bomba demonstrates. But Bomba is not just courageous - He is selfless and kind as he cares for the simple minded Casson in spite of all of the problems this brings about. Bomba has a wonderful character. As I was reading I noticed the remarks about Bomba's race (He and Casson are the only white people in the jungle). I thought that surely this book would be one that would be banned from the public school system. It seemed to me however, that a boy who is all alone in a jungle, never having seen another white man might certainly feel like a minority. I chose to read it as celebrating his heritage rather than demeaning others. There is nothing in the character of Bomba that demonstrates hatred or even unkindness. I believe that Bomba is a wonderful role model of manly character. (The book is also a great vocabulary enhancer - it certainly points out the decline in educational standards since most 10 year old boys I know would never be able to comprehend the wide range of words in this book). If you have young boys and you can find this book - I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bomba, the jungle boy (Bomba series ; no. 1)","review":"My family has a set of Bomba books which my father and his brother read when they were children in the 1940s. I believe there are 18 in the complete set and we still have 16 of them in original yellow hardbound covers. The stories start with a child somehow lost in the Amazon jungle and his adventures of growing up there. Then the boy is found by his parents as an older teenager and returns briefly to New York. When his father is lost in the African jungles the scene shifts to adventures in Africa where he finds and rescues his father from cannibals. Finally there are some adventures on the return from Africa on ships and islands.The books are wonderful adventure for a child's mind.

Even as an adult I like to dust this off and relive Bomba's perilous existence and amazing ability to deal with danger and thwart evil. He is the Chip Hilton of the Jungle, an all around good guy with honor, principles and a heck of a throwing arm, but he slings knives, spears and arrows instead of baseballs and footballs.

Were it not that I gave them to a friend at age 16 prior to a move to Europe, I would likewise love to share them with my 8-year old son. I do not recall much in the way of racism, either covertly or overtly, but the flood under my bridge decreases my subjectivity. The theme and style of writing were definitely reminiscent or the old movie serials of the 30's and 40's, such as &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; and the like. But instead of having to come back the following week for the continuing sequels, the next chapter was just a turned page away. And invariably, each chapter ended with a cliffhanger. Bomba was the adventure series, and both these and the old Landmark (historical) books, proved invaluable sources for reading proficiency. In this age of political correctness, it might not be possible for anyone to consider a re-release or re-publishing something so archaic. But should anyone out there obtain these volumes, a gift to the local public library would allow many to share. ----Johnny Beamsderfer"},{"Title":"Bomba, the jungle boy (Bomba series ; no. 1)","review":"I'm 51 years old and still fondly remember reading all of the Bomba the Jungle Boy books when I was a boy.

I was an avid reader, but was restricted (for financial reasons) to public library fare. The only trouble with the Bomba book was that I had it read by the early afternoon. I gave a memoriable verbal book report in grade school the next week, leaving the class breathless as I led them through one of Bomba's hair-raising adventures, ending with a suspenseful &quot;and if you want to know what happened next, you'll have to read the book.&quot; Alas, that was the only Bomba book I ever read as our small community library didn't have Bomba books and I could never afford to buy another.

Every Sat. we went to town and I spent my money on books. I think they were 65 cents at the time. I learned about South America, particularly the Amazon (maybe the Orinocco) River(s), and Macchu Picchu, anacondas, piranhas, etc., etc. from the Bomba books. I think curare came from elsewhere, but not sure. I do not remember anything about adventures on the high seas. Am I remembering incorrectly, or was there a later series added to the originals? Does anyone have a list of the original titles? How many were there? I seem to remember more than 10. It's amazing what 50 years does to memories like this one. I would love to hear from someone else who remembers Bomba. I would think many of us read those books. Why did the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and The Bobsey Twins last and Bomba didn't? He was much more exciting and exotic. I am a geographer now, so I would think this book helped me on the path. I remember another set called Maida. She traveled with her parents from place to place in New England (I think) and would say &quot;hi&quot; to the new county as they crossed the line--again a geographic bent to the book.

It attempts to cash in on CSI the series by using cryptic quotes from different episodes. Partly through giving a \\"generic\\" and uneducated description of some forensic process, the author breaks into some comparison of a show episode and then bounces to other processes. The book is written very elementary, not put together well and leaves me asking if the non-show information is actually factual and researched, other than looked up on the internet. Very bad.

However, you should note that it is &quot;not affiliated with the show or its producers&quot;There are several things I found annoying about the book. First, while I am a fan of the show and I think I have seen most of the episodes, the episode name dropping got annoying. Its fine if you want to say in such-and-such an episode there was an example of this, but I don't know all of the episodes by name. Perhaps an episode guidee would have helped here.Another annoying recurring theme in the book is the vague references (with too little detail and too little information) to &quot;real&quot; crimes from around North America. I know these are used to describe what happens, but I think there would have been a much more effective way to present them.My main complaint about the book is that it is scattered all over the place. While much of the information on forensics is there, it gets a bit repetitive and mish-mashy at times. The book is organized along themes, but the themes tend to cross-cut meaning that the author refers back to the same principles on more than one occasion.If you are truly interested in forensics, there are lots of good books out there.

Indeed, the last chapter &quot;Evidence Response&quot; is especially well presented.Aside from the oft encountered confusion in definition of &quot;trace evidence&quot;, the book is excellent from the standpoint of crime scene coverage, categorization of forensic methodologies, and readability.

The author actually has a degree in the subject so she really knows what she's talking about. The good points about the book are: You get a quick overview of how crimes are really solved. It's not by the flashy cop like in the movies it's by the CSI person in the lab. The author liberally sprinkles examples real life crimes and how use or misuse of evidence affected the outcome. For instance she shows how the JonBenet Ramsey crime scene was ruined and why the coroner will never be able to get an approximate time of death. She also mentions the O.J. Simpson case. Poor handling of physical evidence turned the tide there. The only objections I have to the book are the design problems.

I'm sure that the writer knows much more than is in this book, and I would like to see a more in-depth coverage written for those who aren't in medicine or law enforcement but who have a genuine interest in the science. If your teen likes the show, it might be an excellent way to get them interested in reading science outside of that dull text from high school."},{"Title":"The Forensic Science of C.S.I.","review":"The hit TV series CSI has spawned interest in forensic science in the public. This book shows you how forensic works in reality, from fingerprint and DNA to blood spatter pattern analyis.It is not an episode guide to the TV show with some explanations tagged on, as another reviewer wrote. The book uses the CSI show merely as an angle to introduce the general reader into this interesting topic. You will surely find much of interest here, even if you have never seen an CSI episode. Author Katherine RAMSLAND also clearly points out where the series does not get it right:* forensic investigations take much more time in reality (whereas in the TV show uses some artistic licence due to narrative necessities)* crime scene investigators don't interrogate suspects* proceedures and tests, which look rather easy in the show, are difficult and time consuming.I liked the methodological approach of the book: It starts with the definition of a crime scene, details the investigation from the inital response of law enforcement personel to the processing of the scene all the way to what happens during the autopsy and in the crime lab. It gives you a good insight into what crime scene investigators do (the kits, equipment and tools they use, what legal and scientific proceedures they have to adher to, how evidence is collected, preserved, investigatedand stored, what happens at the lab and so forth) without being overly technical.As mentioned above, the angle author Katherine RAMSLAND uses is the CSI TV show. So there are often references to the show, what tests GRISSOM and his team used and they are explained in detail without being overly technical. The book is interspersed with references to real crimes (I was surprised to see how many CSI episodes were apparently inspired by true crimes!) and how forensic science helped to solve them.The author also points out the psychological side in chapters on profiling and the use of psychological autopsy.My main complaint with the book is the absence of any kind of illustrations. It is much more instructive when discussing the e.g. various kinds of fingerprints and blood spatter patterns and to actually see some pictures of samples, let alone the equipment in a crime lab. I mean, who knows what a gas chromatograph looks like? Also some kind of diagramms or illustrations would have been helpful with some of the scientific tests. The complete lack of pictures makes the book occassionally a bit dry at times."},{"Title":"The Forensic Science of C.S.I.","review":"I wasn't looking for a manual of forensic science.

It is an interesting companion to a TV series called C.S.I. or Crime Scene Investigator. The show can be pretty technical as it shows investigators solving crimes with the many of the latest techniques like DNA analysis, etc. The book bills itself as a way to explain with more detail the lives of Crime Scene Investigator's (C.S.I.s) and does so very well. It is thorough without being over-technical. Not only is the background information about the show interesting but Ramsland throws in side-stories about real life instances that have used the techniques she just detailed to catch the criminal. It is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the show and is not ready for the less readable, more technical Forensic Science manual."},{"Title":"The Forensic Science of C.S.I.","review":"We loved this book-- on the back cover it asks about a half dozen questions like -- \\"how can a pair of glasses suggest murder rather than suicide?\\" and others-- and then goes on to explain how forensic scientists arrive at their final conclusions using all kinds of methods and analysis. The auhtor has a masters degree in forensic psychology and has published 15 books incuding biographies of such famous writers as anne Rice and Dean Koontz. She also spent a year as a research assistant to former FBI profiler John Douglas...and she writes forensic science articles for Court TV's Crime Library. Note that the book was not authorized, prepared, approved, licensed or endorsed by anyone in connection with the TV series CSI...The book is divided into 11 chapters and includes a good glossary, references section and index. Topics covered begin 1) Scene of Crime and end at 11 Evidence Response and in between include 2) handling bodies 3) ID unknown 4) Traces, 5) We have a Match 6) Science v Intuition 7) Elements of Reconstruction 8)Criminal Logic and 9) Varieties of Deception and 10 Forensic puzzles. I especially like the boldface sections of the book where the author adds some historical perspective ie how the coroner system evolved etc. She certainly demystifies lots of the science of forensics and explains what's fact-based behind some of CSI's most watched shows. Did you know that Iodine fumes are used to bring up latent fingerprints-- well after reading this book you'll know lots more about forensic science...and it's great cocktail chatter too...."},{"Title":"The Forensic Science of C.S.I.","review":"This book is really an episode guide to &quot;CSI&quot; with some forensic science information added. Episodes of the show are referenced by title, so someone who hasn't seen all of the show may be lost. If you want a little more information on forensics or a procedure seen on the show, or if you have no additional knowledge about forensics, then this book is adequate. Otherwise, pass on it; there are much better introductory forensics books for the general public available, such as Hidden Evidence by David Owen or The Casebook of Forensic Detection by Colin Evans."},{"Title":"Graffiti 2","review":"Graffiti is defined in Webster's as \\"an inscription or design scratched into an ancient wall // a rude scribbling on a wall//an incised decorationto reveal a second color.\\" How woefully deficient is this in describing an art form that has been very prominent in the streets and on the walls during the 20th Century.Graffiti has taken many forms over the years.I guess the simplist is where one carves their initials into the school desk,railing or park bench.What a great reminder to come across years later.The next common form was to cut Jack loves Mary,surrounded by a heart in a favorite tree.A somewhat different form was when soldiers wrote on walls in wartime or when prisoners made their mark on prison walls. Then, there were the Burma Shave Signs along the American Highways;which by the way, did not appear in Canada. WWI & WWII brought out a flood of it in Europe,particularly.Of course the best example was KILROY WAS HERE .See my reiew on a book by that name ,by Charles Osgood,dated Dec 24,2003.This book,Graffiti 2 is one of several that came out in the 70's and describes the type of thing that swept North America and particularly Britain. Now we saw the voice of the people making statments,jokes,street philosophy,political statements,simple verses.It seems when there was nothing one could do about a situation;one could always get noticed,get revenge or simply get something off one's chest,by resorting to a public surface. Some of the best examples were when one comment got answered by another;such as my title.Here are a few from the book I really enjoyed;THE GRAFFITI IS TERRIBLE IN THIS PUB-So is the shepherd's pie!FIGHT UNEMPLOYMENT-WASTE POLICE TIMEI AM A VAMPIRE.PLEASE WASH YOUR NECK.GOD MADE THINGS THAT CREEP AND CRAWLBUT BRITISH RAIL,IT BEATS THEM ALLXEROX YOUR LIFE-IF YOU LOSE IT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A COPYFREE WOMEN! -Where?WOMEN WERE BORN WITHOUT A SENSE OF HUMOR-SO THEY COULD LOVE MEN AND NOTLAUGH AT THEMHELP YOUR LOCAL POLICE FORCE---BEAT YOURSELF UP!PLEASE DON'T TOUCH MEPLEASE DON'T TOUCHPLEASE DON'TPLEASE DOPLEASEOHHH!CAN WE HAVE A NEW WALL?ONLY THE MEDIOCRE ARE AT THEIR BESTDEAD PEOPLE ARE COOLKEEP THE BOAT PEOPLE OUT--SINK THE IRISH FERRYIS A LADY BARRISTER A LADY WITHOUT HER BRIEFS?THE ARMY BUILDS MENBUILD ME ONE,VERONICAIN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD--AND THE WORD WAS AARDVARKROSES ARE REDVIOLETS ARE BLUEAND MINE ARE WHITESUICIDE IS THE MOST SINCERE FORM OF SELF-CRITICISMIt seems the British mastered this .Unfortunately we didn't see that level of thought put into graffiti on this side of the ocean.I was working in New York in the late 60's and saw the explosion of Subway Art,particularly on the trains.It spread so prominently,there was hardly any space more than an inch or two that was not covered.Many times it was impossible to see out the windows. The city officials tried everything ,but were essentially helpless.Generally it was the person leaving his \\"MARK\\" ;his goal was to see it on every car.It may have been as simple as SSSS ,4SPADES,etc. Later it progressed to where his \\"MARK\\" would cover the entire car with something like VANDAL;in elaborate letters.When I was in Belfast in 1991,I saw huge political posters painted on the sides of buildings.Some were even professionally done.This street art has evolved to where it covers the backs of buildings such as those ugly walls that face rail lines and highways. Generally ,they are very creative and show considerable skill .For one,I enjoy them. One of my favorite spots in Toronto is at Keele St where the Subway emerges from underground.So,this Graffiti takes many forms and this book covers one of them very well."},{"Title":"The Zincali: An account of the gypsies of Spain","review":"George Borrow was the author of the more well known \\"auto-biographical\\" duet of Lavengro & The Romany Rye.

The protagonist is a brooding killer of men who only ever wanted to be a poet. Maybe that's a cliche, I don't know. If it is, it's a cool one. The history of Viriconium seems much like Wolfe's Torturer books: a new low-tech civilization has grown up from the ashes of a series of fallen high-tech empires. The people of the new civilization use, but rarely comprehend the technology they unearth. There are light-sabers, air-ships, artificial life, body armor and energy-cannons. All rare and fun things.What I didn't like: The scope of the story was huge -- an empire fighting against invasion, but Harrison squeezed it all into a sub-250 page book. Incidents that should have been given more thought were wrapped up with a quick coincidence. Coincidence can keep a story moving, but stretches credibility. The primary antagonist could have used a lot more attention. Worse than this, Harrison made the whole outcome of a war between two empires seem to hinge upon one battle, and the battle to hinge upon one group of heroes. That vexes me. A whole empire full of men and women, and these four guys (and one young girl) are going to make a difference? Bleh. But that's what heroic fantasy is, I guess.

It started out well, it had potential. I -really- enjoyed the way in which the book was written (nice style). The descriptions were -beautiful-. A very colorful world, it is. But it was very weak in the plot. You did not get enough in-depth information about the war, the backgrounds of the characters, the queens themselves. The dire warning shouted by the mechanical bird (which reminded me -waaaay- too much of Clash of the Titans) meant absolutely -nothing- until you were told 'oh, and yeah, those big black things they met in the swamp are war machines'. It was too big a story to fit into such a small novel and it really needed more."},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"This struck me as sort of \\"Elric\\"-like in its presentation. It would not surprise me if the author (who, at the time of publishing, was \\"still in his twenties\\" according to the jacket blurb) was, shall we say, \\"strongly influenced\\" by Moorcock's style of writing and subject matter.In a far-future world where technology is on the decline and \\"swords and sorcery\\" on the rise, a civil war in Earth's last great kingdom threatens to destroy civilization. The aggressor kingdom has unearthed ancient relics of the past that it cannot control.Overall the story moves pretty quickly, and has some relatively memorable characters with unfortunately forgettable names. The ending is pretty cliche and a huge let-down. I would've preferred some slightly stronger links to Earth of our time; Earth has evidently gone through several cycles of decline and rebirth (Midsummer Century, anyone?) and even the ancient artifacts and places don't bear any recognizable resemblance to things we know today. So that lends things a bit too much unreality in my opinion. Others may find the \\"far future\\" vista refreshing.Overall this probably isn't worth going out of your way to acquire.

It tells of how Viriconium, where the remains of an extinct technological civilization are exploited by a sort of medieval kingdom under a young queen, is defended by a small band of warriors against the invasion from the north by the enemy queen, who has resurrected an army of brain-eating androids. The book is a good read for anyone who enjoyed the oblique, surreal world in Viriconium Nights.."},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"By all rights, M. John Harrison's science fantasy The Pastel City ought not to work as well as it does. Almost all of the elements in the trope-laden epic have appeared in far better-known works. The plot reads like something Tolkien might've whipped up for an early draft of The Lord of the Rings. The barren, blasted setting recalls the desert world Arrakis from Dune. And, like Star Wars, it gives a prominent place to exotic energy weapons that that are like swords only awesomer. But Harrison's first novel in the Viriconium series succeeds largely because of elegant diction and incredible action, which form a whole exponentially more fun than the sum of its derivative parts.Viriconium, that metropolis whose multicolored spires bear ancient glyphs none know how to read, stands at a bridge in time. The kingdoms that dwelled in the Afternoon of Earth's history have faltered, and now only Viriconium remains as humanity enters its Evening. But the Northmen do not care that all flesh may be approaching its end. Nursing generations-old grievances, their leader Canna Moidart, embittered niece of the legendary ruler Methven Nian, would see Viriconium's Proton Circuit and the Bistro Californium burn if she cannot rule. The only hope for the true queen lies with tegeus-Cromis, the best swordsman in the land and former member of an elite soldiering corps. Charged with gathering his old comrades and routing the Moidart's approaching armies, he heads north -- only to learn of a second threat. While crossing the Cruachan Ridge, he is accosted by an odd messenger, a croaking, clockwork vulture that warns him to fear the getit chemosit, a creature of which no one in the land seems to have heard.Style is not substance, and yet what lends The Pastel City much of its panache is Harrison's stately prose. Where epic fantasy tends to grow garrulous and overlong, he keeps the proceedings punchy. Instead of situating the action in the typical pseudo-medieval locale, he plunks it into a post-apocalyptic milieu reminiscent of Michael Moorcock or John Christopher. And rather than resort to bland description, he fills passages with explosive color, making both ancient royal dwellings and blasted industrial wastelands burst with exotic hues. Such embellishments cause the story to feel fresh even when it wanders through well-worn territory.Then there is the combat. To be blunt, I have yet to read another novel that infuses its fight scenes with so much ferocity and terror. Exalted and awful, agonizing and magnificent, Harrison's clashes on and off the battlefield have you one moment pressing your nose to the page so as not to miss a jot or tittle and the next recoiling in horror. Tolkien's Battle of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers (the closest genre analog I can think of to The Pastel City's hip-and-thigh slaughter in the Great Brown Waste) pales in comparison. These are interludes that spike your heart rate, speed your eyes across the page and keep you awake well into the wee hours.Given that the novel is first in a series, this review deserves a short postscript. Although all of the Viriconium books and short stories have been collected in a single volume, few of them would draw any except the most stalwart readers. Pretentious to the point of being impenetrable, they seem almost a repudiation of the idea that genre fiction should delight. Instead, seek out a used copy of The Pastel City from AbeBooks or alibris."},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"M. John Harrison, The Pastel City (Doubleday, 1971)That The Pastel City, now long out of print, has been considered a classic by so many for so long may be, in fact, the book's greatest failing. As I've perused reviews of it, the one thing I notice in the negative reviews is disappointment; they didn't get the be-all and end-all of fantasy they thought they were going to. Ay, but here's the rub; a book can be a classic for more than one reason.The Pastel City is, from the plot standpoint, your typical epic fantasy. If you've read Moorcock, Leiber, etc., you have a basic idea of what's going to go on here. Love, death, betrayal, lots of nonhuman baddies, lots of human baddies, a brooding hero-type and his overly sanguine friend, maybe a crazy dwarf or two, and lots of stuff blowing up. This is nothing out of the ordinary, and to be expected from epic fantasy. Those who read it looking for a classic of plot, I assume, are the ones most disappointed by the book.What elevates it from its peers is its sense of style. This is a fantasy as written by a true lexiphile, Elric through the lens of John Dryden, or Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser as written by Chaucer. As with most true prose stylists (Cormac McCarthy comes to mind), Harrison's subtle blend of archaic \\"it's not a fantasy novel unless you do this\\" diction, contemporary British phrasing, and little stylistic tricks that pull the whole in an entirely new direction takes a little getting used to at first. But once you've got the rhythm of it down, you can get pulled along for the ride with consummate ease.So let me make this clear: The Pastel City is a good book. A fine book, and one worth reading. The typical fantasy fan should probably not expect too much. The fantasy fan who is more attuned to the details of writing will get the most out of it. Word lovers, fantasy fans or not, are going to get a kick out of this. ***"},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"The Pastel City, set in the world of Viriconium, is an early novel from M. John Harrison. It's a sword and sorcery story, basically, but with the sorcery replaced by ruins of ancient high technology. Queen Jane of Viriconium tries to defend her kingdom against the forces of ruin and destruction, with the help of old warriors, methvens. Their enemy is armed with mysterious and dangerous forces, and ruin seems inevitable.Yet there's a strange metallic bird, with a strange message, offering a chance to survive. In the middle of a lost war, curious events unfold. Viriconium is an interesting world, unlike any other. While the story isn't that remarkable, the setting is interesting and this short book is worth reading for that alone. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"The Dying Earth genre, a personal favorite, has three great classics that tower above all others - Smith's Zothique stories, Vance's four Dying Earth novels, and the New Sun books by Wolfe.Dying Earth stories are science fantasy, not science fiction. Many have tried to define the essential difference between those fraternal twins of the imagination: science fiction and fantasy. It usually ends in some notion of the setting being in the future versus the past. Definitions differ, but to me it is simple enough, and not a matter of something as trivial as setting. It is a fundamental philosophical difference. Science fiction is not so much about the future as it is about the modern. Sci-fi defends modernity, in fact revels in it. Its basic belief is that man makes \\"progress\\" and that the future will consist of more and more of this \\"progress\\", in some upward spiral of ever increasing (and ultimately superficial) materialistic excess, leading finally to the stars and beyond. Fantasy, on the other hand, is not so much about the past as about the rejection of modernity; it wants to take us not into external, material excess but into the internal world, a better world that might once have existed, or, if it never did, the world as it SHOULD exist.Since modernity is the central farce, the pivotal lie of our decadent time, it should be no surprise that science fiction has produced nothing that could be called literature, whereas fantasy has produced the greatest classics of the last century or so. And of course dying earth books do not believe in progress, but in the inevitable decline of man and the industrial world.But the easiest way to tell science fantasy from science fiction is simply this: fantasy never ages, whereas science fiction has a shelf life of about a year. Go back and read the books of Asimov or Heinlein or Dick or any other old science fiction - the anachronisms render it unreadable, if it wasn't nearly so to start with. But The Silmarillion or The Gods of Pegana, much older books, haven't aged a day. And neither have Clark Ashton Smith's stories from the thirties, and neither has this book by M. John Harrison.I happen to like the style of these old genre novels from the seventies; they are a lot more compact and readable than the stuff that appeared after. There was really a miniature golden age for science fantasy in that decade - I am reminded of the great Kane novels of Karl Edward Wagner, for example, and the Gor novels.I am also reminded of Michael Moorcock, because this novel reads like Moorcock, if Moorcock could write. Moorcock, if you don't know, was a sixties-era political nincompoop who wore his ideology on his sleeve and churned out potboilers on first draft in three or four days of writing, as he admitted. Had he ever grown out of the silly ideas of that drugged out decade and actually tried to write for real his imagination might have carried him far, for his creative instincts were good, but he never did and in fact his work got much worse and even more idiotically political when he tried to get halfway serious. Harrison isn't quite as good a prose writer as his reputation has it, he is not in the class of Vance, for example, but this book is way better than anything Moorcock ever spurted out. And of course there is more imagination in any of the books mentioned than in the complete works of the kinds of writers the \\"literary\\" crowd likes, that is, the dull trivialities of the Updikes, Pynchons, Roths, etc., all of whose doorstops of books are destined for total obscurity in some landfill somewhere a century or two from now, after the ridiculous parody of civilization that allowed such things to flourish has run its course. Which come to think of it, is just the kind of thing that dying earth novels are about.This first Viriconium novel is certainly one you have to pick up if you like science fantasy or the Dying Earth genre at all, a genre that needs more good books."},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"Viriconium sits on the ruins of an ancient civilization that nobody remembers.

Queen Jane needs the help of the men who once served her father so faithfully, so she sends tegeus-Cromis to find and take command of her army. Along the way, he picks up some of his old comrades and is accosted by a talking metal vulture who insists that Cromis go directly to see a mysterious man who lives in an obsidian tower by the sea. According to the mechanical bird, the future of Viriconium, indeed the whole world, depends on it. As the men travel north, they discover that the Afternoon Cultures left behind a lot more than piles of rusting metal.The Pastel City, published in 1971, is the first part (only 158 pages) of M. John Harrison's science fantasy epic VIRICONIUM which, according to sources, was inspired by Jack Vance's DYING EARTH and the poetry of T.S. Eliot. Characterization and pacing are sometimes a bit weak, but the scenery in The Pastel City is grand, and I enjoyed the story. In many ways it reminded me of THE LORD OF THE RINGS -- a group of comrades (including a dwarf) travel through beautiful and desolate landscapes (across rivers and marshes, through mountain tunnels, etc.) on a quest to destroy something so they can save the world.A major difference, and what saves the book from being simply another quest fantasy, is the post-apocalyptic vision of an unknown advanced civilization which died out mysteriously, leaving samples of their devastating handiwork behind. Thus, the dwarf arms himself with an 11-foot tall mechanical skeleton and carries some sort of laser. Cromis and his friends ride into one battle on horseback, but leave in a glass blimp. Cool.I was fascinated by the discoveries that Cromis and his friends made and the hints that the Afternoon Cultures understood the mathematics of the universe. The thought that our heroes may have \\"woken something from the Old Science\\" is a frightening one, especially since they have less idea about how to control it than their dead predecessors did. There's a clear message here, but it's not heavy-handed. As Queen Jane says:We have always regarded the Afternoon Cultures as a high point in the history of mankind. Theirs was a state to be striven for, despite the mistakes that marred it. How could they have constructed such things? Why, when they had the stars beneath their hands?Though I'm reviewing each book in the VIRICONIUM epic separately, I'm actually listening to the audiobook version of the omnibus edition. It's recently been produced by Neil Gaiman Presents and is narrated by Simon Vance who is one of the absolute best in the business. This is a high-quality production and highly recommended for anyone who wants to read one of M. John Harrison's best-loved works."},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"From an old paperback edition of this title: \\"Far in the future gallant knights in armor battle the wild forces of a dying technology\\"This book is, in my opinion, a benchmark that all heroic fantasy will be measured against. Harrison is able to portray the true reality of conflict - those that profess to live for it are truly dead inside, regardless of what side they fight for. This is a truism that is absent in most books of this type.The plot is standard fare: in the late afternoon of earth the remnants of humanity rut in the ruins of the past, technology is lost and society is a mixture of atomic cannons drawn by horses, airships battling for kingdoms and man facing oblivion. Two Queens vie for the same throne, a war begins, one side employees an alien relic of the past- giants that are nearly indestructible. The giants are uncontrollable and turn on their masters, a quest is begun to find the method of destroying the giants.As a plot this would be a routine fantasy saga; what raises this above all others [of the type] is Harrison's use of language and some of the most refreshing characters in a fantasy novel in a long, long time. A great book a must re-read someday."},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","review":"Tight and well paced science fantasy. I've been searching for more stories of Virconium ever since reading this, and i'd have to disagree with some of the other reviews here - i think the books berevity adds to the story.

Since I have the paperback, I read the review for it. I agree with everything said by ROBERTO \\"rofernan\\". I'm sure that the hardness of the cover is not the important feature of this book. The art speaks directly. So often, we see famous ancient works. That's great and safe. But to present works fresh and relatively unknown, from a living tradition is art appreciation in the highest. By focusing on the work and lives of 14 Zen Masters, we see how each represents the whole, the spiritual depth of Zen, while learning history, both Japanese and American, east meeting west. This book was published in conjunction with an exhibition that toured four museums from 1998-2000. There are 90 plates and 28 figures.

It contains a comprehensive account of life among the inhabitants, as well as the history and all other aspects of the country. I lived in Morocco in 1966 and 1967, and therefore read this account with the highest interest. There are a number of amusing anecdotes, such as the one about the Jew who was thrown to a hungry lion, but the lion refused to eat him. The reader may be a bit confused about Marrakesh being called Morocco, but it is from this that the country derived its name."},{"Title":"Toros without tears: A simple explanation of what you will see at a bull-fight : with illustrations and a plan of the Plaza Mexico","review":"Like most people, I had little idea regarding the events of a traditional bullfight.

There is a fairly rigid pattern to the fight, although some deviation is allowed, most alternative actions lead to a significant \\"loss of face.\\"While I cannot say that I think any more highly of a bullfight than I did before reading this book, I can say I now know more about the techniques and meanings of the actions.

Swearing allegiance to Egypt's last Pharaoh, they gird themselves against famine and attacking forces from both north and south. But prophecies foretell the strange fate to befall the mighty of these desert kingdoms -- as a dream predicts a wicked ruler's death, a young slave uncovers a deadly betrayal, and the Children of the Lion face the dangers of a beautiful woman's cruel wiles and a new enemy's flashing swords. Now this stirring legend tells of the fabulous adventures of brave heroes... the glittering splendor of conquerors and kings... the glorious passions of men and women, once in chains, now free to challenge and to love."},{"Title":"Lord of the Nile (The Children of the Lion, Book 6)","review":"Book 6 in the \\"Children of the Lion\\" series is a continuation of the fascinating story of Bible character Joseph as he lived in Egypt.

It includes maps of numerous suggested areas for effective birdwatching around the city (downtown, as well as suburban areas to the north, south and west, and even into NW Indiana). It also has information regarding local birdwatching and ornithological groups.For example, it may say that one bird can be observed &quot;over the Des Plaines river in springtime.&quot; Or that others are generally found only in the suburbs or rural areas fringing the city, though local colonies may establish themselves in the lakefront parks. A nice touch.Additionally, each bird description a time-graph that charts the relative frequency of sightings for a given species in the Chicago area over the course of a year. Together with the visual identification chart and the descriptive text, it helps the beginning birder judge whether s/he really just saw a female &quot;English Sparrow,&quot; as opposed to a &quot;Song Sparrow,&quot; or a &quot;Field Sparrow,&quot; etc.Bird identification is by way of paintings, and not photos. The paintings are not as detailed or reliable as some other volumes (e.g. Sibley's Guide), but they are sufficient for the book's limited purpose which is as a local/regional supplement to these larger and more detailed tomes. Recommended."},{"Title":"Birds of Chicago (U.S. City Bird Guides)","review":"I've been watching birds for 30 years and found this is a useful book for beginning birders and experienced birders for Chicago area birds. This guide cannot be all inclusive of species in the Chicago area, due to the large amount of birds that travel through the area during migration. However, what it does include is more information on the familiar species than other guides. Information includes behavior, habitat, songs and calls, tips for quick ID, and abundance charts for each bird species.

The one on 'Are You Paying Fines For Your Company Meetings?' is meant to heighten awareness about the cost of poorly run meetings.

He refers to them as \\"thought sparks,\\" and truly they are. His ideas will cause you to reconsider yourself, the universe, appropriate behavior, and much more. Written with presence and force, THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN will open up channels of thought you didn't know existed. It will cause you to drift upon intellectual currents previously untapped. These were my experiences with the text and I would think anyone else's as well. Just one of three of Dickhoff's texts in print, surely this is the first one to use to begin your inward journey toward Higher Consciousness thinking.

Craig Barnes, pastor of the National Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., is the book to turn to in those disquieting moments when it becomes clear the plans we have made -- perhaps staked our futures upon -- have become finally so much dust. In accessible and at times deeply-moving prose it helps the sympathetic reader get beyond the question &quot;Why me, Lord?&quot; that inevitably accompanies such disappointment to a deeper understanding of what it means to worship a God whose ineffable grace is often to refuse us what we insist we want most.&quot;When God Interrupts&quot; is book of hard contemporary wisdom set firmly within the Christian tradition. It is only secondarily a work of inspiration, although it contains passages that will invariably draws tears of recognition, and it will bring absolutely no comfort to those used to browsing the self-help literature for answers to their problems. It is a book for those who may have labored for years under the illusion that they have somehow taken the measure of God, at last understood His will, and are now ready to accept His reward for all their faith and righteousness. God's silence at the other end of this &quot;deal&quot; can be overwhelming, but for Barnes such moments, and he refers to them here and in other contexts as abandonments, are an invitation, a challenge to finally give to God what He wants most from us: ourselves.One quotation is sufficient to catch the thrust of the book:&quot;When we are abandoned by the things we value, whenwe discover that no matter how much we have gatheredwe do not have enough, when we realize that even inthe currency we value we are very poor, we are readyto start talking to God. Not before. Faith meansbetting our lives on the grace of God. (page 75)&quot;This is a book in the tradition of Peter Kreeft's &quot;Making Sense of Suffering&quot; but one that gets substantially closer to the felt experience of living a loss and the painful journey back to a God we may feel -- and perhaps have great justification for feeling -- chose to challenge us where we are most vulnerable and then disappear. Barnes's himself recognizes that these are journeys we may not wish to take, likening us on one occasion to Christ's disciples soundly sleeping through His agony in the Garden of Gethsemani, but once the journey is undertaken, it can, will, must lead to new life. God asks of us everything that we have, and more to the point, all that we are, but in the end He leaves us, and Barnes is entirely convincing on this point, with &quot;a purer form of ourselves(page 157).&quot;"},{"Title":"When God Interrupts: Finding New Life Through Unwanted Change","review":"A little over six years ago I started to experience as series of very disturbing &quot;interruptions&quot; in a life that I thought had progressed nicely up until that point. Little did I know that M. Craig Barnes had just published a book that would help me greatly in making some sense of it all. I'm glad to have found it.Any Christian who has suffered a huge interruption in the life that he or she has expected to live will benefit from this book. Like it or not, most of us will be abandoned by many things we value in this life. Even the best things we have our only ours for a time. We stand to lose our material wealth, our health, our livelihood, people we love, and finally our very lives as such. Dealing with this grim reality requires a choice of perspective. We can devote our life's energies to trying to preserve our lives as we want, or hope, them to be. The fear of losing our self-made lives will rule our lives. Inevitably, loss will come. How will you take that loss? If the meaning you find in your life depends on your ability to keep it the way you want it, then the loss may come pretty hard. Alternatively, M. Craig Barnes presents a perspective based on Bible lessons and people's stories which can help us to see and appreciate the sum of our lives as an unearned gift from God.Gaining this perspective requires a conversion process that goes beyond mental assent to certain doctrines or simple belief. It is when we are abandoned by things we hold most dear that the test of faith comes. Is it real, or is it mostly dependent on our having our lives the way we want them to be? Most of us will have more than one opportunity in our lives to find out. The good news is that, even if we can't have the life we wanted, God can show us a way to want the life we have. Sounds risky (and it is). But, no matter how much we have in this life, we will lose it all some day. Learning how not to worry about losing what we think we depend upon for our peace and security could be a long, uncomfortable process. But if being so focused on &quot;saving&quot; the kind of life we want is making us blind and ignorant to the better kind of life that God wants for us, then it is a risk worth taking. This is not to say that it's good to throw the nice things we have in life away. But I would like to be the kind of person who can lose those things when the time comes without too much regret and also use them (while I have them) to bless others in God's name. This can only happen if I truly believe that my life is the product not of my own will and struggle, but of an intimate and everlasting relationship with God.This book is a good elaboration on what Jesus means by losing our life when we try to save it and finding it when we lose it for His sake (Matt. 16:25) and what it means to find the pearl of great value (Matt. 13:45). As Barnes says at the end of his book, &quot;People who have a God do not need to become one&quot;. This book will help you break the habit of trying to be your own life's savior and enjoy letting God do that for you. If you read this book and want more, I would also recommend Philip Yancey's books &quot;Disappointment With God&quot; and &quot;Reaching for the Invisible God&quot;. But don't pass this one up for those. I read this after Yancey's books and gained many valuable insights."},{"Title":"When God Interrupts: Finding New Life Through Unwanted Change","review":"I thought after I read Sacred Thirst (which mysteriously appeared in the back of my car and remained there for over a year) that there was no point in reading any of the other books by Craig Barnes becasue they would never measure up to this one. I was wrong. I have read 3, bought 6 and am on my fourth. This one is beautifully written, as are all his books. Maybe this one goes even deeper to the heart of the matter, which I would say is Barnes' specialty. He tells more truth, the deep, hard truth, and somehow leaves you changed and deeply grateful for having heard it. The way I use these books is this: I read a small section (all Barnes' books are organized into smaller sections within each chapter) as part of my morning devotion. This and his other books have made an enormous impact on me and the people I've shared them with."},{"Title":"When God Interrupts: Finding New Life Through Unwanted Change","review":"I have read and enjoyed many \\"help\\" type books but this one really impacted me.

Barnes does not wax philosophical...rather, he address the fact that life can hurt and unwanted change even more so....but in the end, we have to believe that God is working on something better for our behalf.Best quote in the book, \\"God has interrupted our ordinary expectations, as cherished as they were, to conceive something. We can't manage it. We can't even understand it. All we can do is receive it.

In the thirty years since Johnson had started this dumbing down process for all of the children to be equal in America, they must talk alike whether they think alike or not. The churches had to intervene and train children who did not live in the ghettoes that what they had been learning was brainwashing and they had to reach out to put some semblance of intelligent design to the thinking of most of the population. We are not all New Orleans where they've always talked that way.The church schools had to try to put matters straight so that upper class and middle class students could return to the level of their parents in the educational system. Our Methodist college in Pulaski never did dumb down as we had only a few foreigners who wished to be taught proper English and not the dumbed down slang out of the projects of America. It took a dumb and stupid person in authority to make this country into the uneducated nation it has become. Drugs and crime proliferated as the language skills hit skid row. Movies were as bad and apparently the teachers were forced to teach in an inferior way. Surely, their higher education courses did not use that kind of language.Some of the lower classes still don't know grammar in this enlightened age of history. We have a lot to answer to as a person who only pretended to be a historian was only a creative writer. Now, the local daily newspaper has one named Jamie Satterfield, could be female or male, who uses adjectives for complete sentences and uses opinions instead of facts in front page articles. It riles me no end and I complain. But trying to get anything done properly in this town is almost impossible.Churches have the most influence on young people than the schools these days and the trend can be reversed with the right leaders. Tutors can be used to show them proper English. Now, I understand why the Orientals who come to this town refuse to speak English. Today's version of English grammar is not correct in any language. They prefer to talk in their own dialects and funny-sounding fast talk so that we can't understand what they are saying. The churches could do the same by teaching the old way of Bible talk. We must learn to cope and deal with God on a personal basis. Sometimes, what we wants is not necessarily what we are intended to have, and we have to search for a new direction. New is always better than something built on deception and deceit. Truthfulness is lacking in today's world, so it is absolutely necessary to beware of smooth talkers and take time to know the person before becoming devoted to him. There are many fakers in this world from small larger towns (not quite cities) to New York and L. A., but they are not what they project. Put your trust in God and in no human."},{"Title":"Handbook of Multicultural Counseling, 1995","review":"This book embodies what multicultural counseling is all about, the state of the art.

It includes a prequel story to the Bone People, in a short about the origins of Simon. Hulme is such a talented writer, she can tell a story eloquently from a variety of perspectives. Here we see her write even from the perpective of a whale. Another example of her abilities to shift modes is keenly expressed in a pair of shorts in this volume, which tell of the breakdown of a relationship first from the man's perspective, then the woman's - and still make it feel like two stories. Fascinating; educational. One would never believe that she is not actually either of those characters.Hulme is a refreshingly honest, in-tune, extremely talented writer. This volume is out of print, but you can find used copies out there on web-based book exchanges. Heads up: word on the streets is that she's got a 3rd novel coming out very soon. The content is worth the work involved to find/purchase a copy."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"J.K.J.'s Three Men in a Boat is a hillarious story about middle class Victorians travelling on a boat on Thames. The book is filled with many humorous stories about the &quot;tribulations&quot; and &quot;disabilities&quot; they have and had experienced. One the most comical moments is the trio packing their luggage. Unfortunately, to the end of the story, the author evidently runs out of humorous scenes to narrate. Still, this book is a comical classic.The sequel to Three Men On A Boat, Three Men On The Bummel is less succesful. Despite, this it is still amuzing to to read J.K.J. describe the laws and customs of German people.Both Three Men On A Boat and Three Men On The Bummel are comical, clasical gems.

Jerome paints his little books with gloriously goofy antics, as we watch three upper-class Englishmen try to rough it -- on land and on water.The three men are George, Harris and the narrator, who are all massive hypochiandriacs -- they find that they have symptoms of every disease in existance (except housemaid's knee). To prop up their failing health, they decide to take a cruise down the Thames in a rented boat, camping and enjoying nature's bounty.Along with Monty -- an angelic-looking, devilish terrier -- the three friends set off down the river. But they find that not everything is as easy as they expected. They get lost in hedge mazes, end up going downstream without a paddle, encounter monstrous cats and vicious swans, have picnics navigate locks, offend German professors, and generally get into every kind of trouble they possibly can.But our valiant outdoorsmen aren't done yet. Some years after the first book, the boys are feeling stifled by domesticity. So they decide to take a vacation from home, hearth, and some equally stifled wives -- by taking a bike trip in Germany. Naturally, they have trouble even before they leave -- hard bike seats, a history of leaving wives behind, and a dog that eats ball bearings.But eventually they get to Germany, and promptly cycle their way through towns, cities, and the Black Forest. Our narrator reflects on German personalities, customs, and geography... and when he isn't, they are rained on, get lost, get into linguistic battles over cushions, encounter more odd dogs, and finally the most important question: what is a Bummel anyway?As you'd expect, the first book is an absolute riot of comic disasters, written in Wodehousian prose. The second... not so much. But even though they were published more than a century ago, Jerome K. Jerome was uproariously funny -- he was able to wring humour from any subject, be it poetry, bicycles, pets, plaster fish, or the woes of setting up a tent successfully.Jerome's real talent is in finding humor in everyday things, like trying to erect a tent in the woods, fighting the weather, or trying to fix one's own bicycle. Written in Jerome's dry, goofy prose, these little occurrances become immensely funny. And for stuff that is funny anyway -- like an anatomically correct bike seat -- it becomes hilarious (\\"it was like riding on an irritable lobster!\\").The second book does get a bit dry at times, as Jerome spends a lot of time musing on Germany rather than conjuring wacky hijinks. And the first book's end has its solemn, compassionate moment when the boys find a drowned woman: \\"She had sinned - some of us do now and then - and her family and friends, naturally shocked and indignant, had closed their doors against her.\\"But back on the funny stuff. The capstone on all this humor is the \\"three men.\\" These guys are basically pampered Victorian aristocrats, who have a romantic yearning for the great outdoors and not too many brains. You'll be laughing at them and with them, as they struggle through the basics of boating and camping.Wacky, self-mocking, and full of odd people, \\"Three Men in a Boat\\" and its slightly less funny sequel \\"Three Men on a Bummel\\" are still fresh and funny a century after they were written."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"What to say, what not to say. Whenever someone ask me to recommend a good book to him/her, I always say 'Three Men in a Boat'. Comedy can never be better than this.There are some books that are made funny by exaggeration and some have too simple and obvious events in it that when you actually think about it, they become funny and if you start imagining them, well......you only end up crying (with laughter), holding your stomach and trying to breathe, which you were not able to do so due to your uncontrollable laugh.Actually that is exactly what happens when you read these two books.Something like putting heavy stuff on eggs during packing, or the cheese event, or laughing during a tragic song, or...... The list goes on and on. So enjoy such moments and others like it, read the book :)"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"There is no funnier book. All travel comedy epics are based on this hilarious account of three men making their way down the Thames river. I read this when I was a child and was determined my football loving cretin of a husband would enjoy it as well if I could only force him to read. He refused. I then began reading bits of the book which immediatly had him leaned over and gasping from laughing too much. Needless to say, he has been giving out copies to friends ever since. This is a great gift to give to recent divorcees and cancer patients since it helps anyone reading it forget the dark side of life as they emerse themselves into the grand farce of three goof-balls living the high life on a leaky boat without a can opener."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"'Three men in a boat' is not a perfect book because it bears the traces of Jerome's original high-mindedly conception, an historical tour of the Thames. too often the uproarious comedy - generally arising from the inflation of minor iritations to epic catastrophes - is tripped by lumbering, perfunctory descriptions of the scene and its historical associations. The latter aren't all bad though - sometimes set up for bathetic effect; at others, the reverie of a romanticallly vivid past and a pure geography free from the industrial blight of Victorian Britain, exerts a powerful, nearly mystical pull. Frequently, the general self-confidence of the narrative voice is undermined by the obsession with death, other people and the fragility of identity and status - one terrifyingly comic sequence, in which Harris gets lost in the labyrinthine garden of Hampton Park, has a nonsense-pushing-into-terror worthy of Lewis Carroll.there are three genuine joys in this book - that narrative voice (imagine a middle-class wannabe Bertie Wooster with pretensions, undeservedly complacent yet ultimately generous, filtered with the casual loquaciousness of Mark Twain); a portrait of late-19th century English life and leisure from a perspective we rarely see (Lewis' introduction is full of fascinating historical background); and the creation of Montmorency the dog, the one fully fledged character - malevolent, cynical, contemptuous, and, when faced with an unflappable cat, a big jessie."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"This book is something of a family tradition in my family...my father couldn't resist reading choice bits to my sister and me when we were kids. It's a marvelously entertaining book and I still like to refer to myself, like J., as &quot;having a general disinclination to work of any kind&quot;. Always a reliable book to read when one desperately needs a laugh, it's also an interesting insight into middle-class Victorian life. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"I recently picked this book up at a store, and enjoyed almost every page of it. The story is of 3 men (and, of course, a dog) taking a boat up the Thames for a little relaxation. You can figure out from there what might happen: a hundred comic misadventures. I was laughing out loud at some of the incidents he describes, which is rare for me.Be aware that the book is Victorian, and does not read like a modern novel (although it is remarkably modern for a 120 year old story). Some may find the style a bit stilted, and the book is definitely funnier at the beginning than it is at the end. Perhaps Jerome was running out of humorous commentary, which would also explain the unexpectedly short finish.All in all, a very enjoyable read, with deserved comparison to Mark Twain. Some may find Connie Willis' &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; to be a modern-day, witty follow-up, with several references back to the original. Enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"What a delightful read! The book weaves the happenings of a current boat trip with stories of previous trips and experiences. It is hillarious, laugh-out-loud funny in a lot of spots. The language is superb and the research section is very helpful. All in all a great read!"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"I was going to hold off on glowing reviews for a bit, but I couldn't resist commenting on this book. I'm not even sure how I stumbled on Jerome, but I found Three Men on the Bummel about as funny as anything I've read in a long while. Bummel is about three Englishmen from the Victorianish era heading off for a bike trip through the Black Forest. I've studied German off and on for a few years, so I got a kick out of Jerome's comments on the language and people, and with the driest of dry observations energized by a bit of hyperbole it was the rare book that had me laughing out loud. Both stories are very funny, but Three Men on the Bummel was laugh out loud funny to me, and his observations on the German people (pre-WWII) were uncannily prescient. He was an unusually perceptive and observant writer, to say the least.As an aside, I've noticed most people seem to find Three Men in a Boat the funnier of the two, but you really can't go wrong with either, in my opinion. Both stories are similar, they involve a bungling, but not too bungling, English fellow getting in a bit over his head with his mates, and the use of humorous exaggeration is about as well done as you ever see it in print. For a Wodehouse, etc fan- these are in must read territory."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"The major problem to this book is that it is poorly structured. The book seems to just end when it runs out of pages. Amazingly it doesn't really matter, you still have a wonderful time reading it."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read.

This is a great choice if you want to read something that's fun but has literary merit as well."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"Even if the book has been written more than 100 years ago, it's still one of the funniest, greatest examples of English humour. Don't read it on trains, busses, or any other public place : everybody will think you're mad."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"A delightful series of novels, whose characters and witticisms revolve around the writer's preoccupation with the complexities of the trivial, in a universe governed by an almost Murphian law of negativity.Although slightly misdirected in parts, Three Men in a Boat begins and concludes strongly, with clear indications of Jerome grammatical might. Three Men on the Bummel, on the other hand, displays a sense of consistency and maturity in its structure, lacking in the former, without compromising the boyish effervescence of Jerome's wit.The strengths of both novels lie in Jerome's power of description and mastery of grammar. With an almost addictive attention to detail, a series of hyperbolic anecdotes focus' on the ridiculous, through which the novelist is able to extract a most wondrous sense of delight from his characters' most earned pessimism.With a most fantastic attachment to the ridiculous, Jerome characterises his three heroes as a most capably incapable trio, whose exploits will leave you in stitches."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"There's a reason Three Men In A Boat has never been out of print, well over a century after its first publication! A great book, and the lesser but still enjoyable companion book makes for hours of relaxing reading, and transport to another time and place, indeed, another world."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"HM the Queen-Empress might well have been amused. I was. There is more than a little of Mark Twain in this traveloguette; Mr Jerome's wit, though properly British of the nineteenth century, somehow calls up memories of the great Clemens' travel tales, specially 'A Tramp Abroad'. No great guffaws here but many smiles. One might call it British humor for those who don't like British humor. If you liked 'Monty Python', well..."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"Jerome K. Jerome is a recent and most welcome discovery. The passage of time sometimes pushes excellent authors off onto literary sidings, much as high speed passenger trains do to important but less flashy local trains. Jerome's \\"Three Men in a Boat\\" and \\"Three Men on the Bummel\\" should not be allowed to be shunted aside. Simply put, this two book in a single volume edition, is fun to read. You don't need specific knowledge of travel in England or Germany to appreciate Jerome's trips with his friends. It does add to the fun, but it is not necessary! You can, however, appreciate the comradeship and comedy of three guys who know each other and each other's foibles only too well, knocking about together on vacation. I've been on these sorts of trips and the scenarios are described to perfection. These stories are exactly what you would want to write about a trip with friends, if you could write as delightfully as Jerome K. Jerome. Highly recommended for just plain fun."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"This is actually two books in one, both that I have read.The author is known all over the world and the book istranslated into many languages (even into Estonian). Threefriends decide to make a trip (first in a boat by theriver, then on a bummel in the German woods). Although fromthat it may see like a country living story, the maincharacters are in no way accustomed to these surroundings.It is written in very laughable way. Actually you can't helpbut get your laughing muscles tired after a while. I stilluse an idea from the book &quot;I like work... watching it&quot;."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"I liked it, but then I have a dry wit as well. It is two books in one publication and so it is good value. It also came from an age where the average folk could afford to buy books. So it is very colloquial in content. The sort of \\"you could be out having fun\\" too sort of tale. And yet most of us could easily replicate a journey like their's either rowing up the Thames or biking in Germany.So not a laugh a minute slapstick stuff but definitely funny. On the other hand if you are worried, buy a used copy some of them are quite cheap. Or get it from the library."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"This little book is a delight through and through."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"i have nothing to say about the product, a book i have allready read. i am very satisfied with the delivery. thank you"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"I have been reading some good, but bleak literature lately, so I decided to turn to something a bit lighthearted. I think there is nothing better to fit that bill than Jerome K Jerome's hilarious \\"Three Men in a Boat.\\" This Penguin edition also adds \\"Three Men on the Bummel,\\" a worthy sequel that Jerome wrote roughly ten years later. I cannot believe I'd never heard of these gems before. This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest books I've ever read. Despite the fact that Jerome is writing to us from the Victorian era, the humor is timeless. The writing style could be a bit touchy for some, but for me, that is what added extra dimensions of humor to the stories. It's the intricate way Jerome conveys his acidic comments that leave you in stitches.\\"Three Men in a Boat\\" is certainly the more humorous of the two. In this tale, three friends, J., George, and Harris, with Montmorency the dog in tow, decide to take a jaunt down the Thames for rest and relaxation. What ensues is a wild stream of hilarious tales and misadventures. Often, the trip takes a backseat to the stories, as J. talks about an assortment of topics. My favorite stories concerned the cheese, the weather, and the German singing the \\"humorous\\" song. Another favorite is the descriptions of how the three learned to sail and row. I don't want to give away any of the details of these stories because they are just too hilarious; I would also kill the humor if I tried to relate them. This story also gives some detail to historical places along the river. The introduction to this book shows how historical accounts of river travel were quite popular. Jerome set out to write such an account, and the publisher dropped much of this material and left the funny anecdotes intact.\\"Three Men on the Bummel,\\" written in 1900, reunites the three (minus Montmorency) for a biking excursion in Germany. While still funny in spots, it lacks the vigor of its predecessor. I found the tale about the water hose a hoot, but Jerome tends to spend more time on travelogue. His observations about the German people are eerily prophetic, as you'll see when you read the book. The language is still acid sharp, and Jerome has an interesting eye for details that make this story a joy to read.If you don't mind roaring at the misfortunes of others, and enjoy wry sarcasm, you will delight in these two stories. Also, you are lying if you don't recognize Uncle Podger in your own family. As I write this review, I'm chuckling over the memory of some of the stories. In fact, you may want to be careful while reading this; you'll continue to laugh later as more layers of Jerome's humor emerge in your mind. A great book for a rainy day!"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"I first read this book in translation to Russian, many (too many!) years ago. In the former Soviet Union (and in Russia proper, before there ever was a Soviet Union), this and other books by Jerome. K. Jerome were very popular. When I came to Boston 20 years ago as a refugee from Soviet Union, this was one of the first books I bought. I was hoping that, in its original language, it would be even a greater fun to read and I was not disappointed! In fact, the book has been in constant use ever since, having been loaned to many friends and even taken by some of them on a holiday trip to England (which included a week-long boat trip on the Thames!). It is very funny and its wit is timeless. This book is a great antidote against winter blues. It is also good as a remedy for our tendency to exaggerate shortcomings of others while papering over our own little faults and imperfections. Whether discussing their problems, high on the list of which is their \\"general disinclination to work of any kind\\", or planning their trip and packing supplies for it; whether rowing their boat or pitching a tent and trying to keep dry on a rainy night -- the characters are totally alive and recognizable. In fact, I am sure we all met people just like them, except they were not dressed as Victorian gentlemen on a holiday! But forget what they wear and what items they pack (or forget to pack) for their trip, or the fact that a cab they take to the railroad station is horse-driven, and these guys could be living in an apartment next door! Never will you hang another picture on your wall without thinking of Uncle Poger and never will you buy Stilton cheese again without some trepidation! I'd recommend this (and other Jerome's books, especially, \\"Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow\\") to anyone above the age of 12 and possessed of even a bit of a sense of humor. P.S. Did I mention that this book improves upon re-reading? A rare quality, indeed!"},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"Warning: if you have any abdominal problems - for your own sake do not read this book cause you will die laughing!

It's a very different type of humor from the one we are used to from the contemporary sit-coms. This humor is very refined and sharp, always on the boundary with acid sarcasm. The characters in the book are so real and alive that you will definitely recognize in them someone that you know, or maybe even yourself at times.

So why only 4 stars? Because it's not consistantly funny. The problem seems to be that Jerome started to write a travel story, with some serious thought on history and life, and added a few humorous bits as he went along. His editor got him to tone down the history and emphasize the humor, but we, the readers, are still stuck with some dreary Victorian romantic musings.But then there are the funny bits. And there are a lot of them. I'd say 80% of this book is funny, and a good 10% is hysterically funny. Well worth the few dull patches.WARNING: Do not read this in a public place.

The book begins in an ominous note as one of the rowers-to-be is self diagnosed to be sufferring from all maladies but Housemaids Knee, in the compendium. A professional advise calls for a change of air which plunges the three men on a boat. The hilarious (mis)adventures apart, the story is embroidered with a picturesqe description of the English rain-meadows, the likes of which are feared to be on their banks of extinction, along with a quaint narrative of the history of the places. All these together catapults the story to a great height, with roars of laughter, but not only that. Recollections of, the happenings at the Maze; the curios incident of the German singer; and Montmorency: his very thoughts; will continue to coerce the reader to belly-laughs The enlivening, to say the least, line drawings as illustrations, is a jewel in the books crown.

I speak of THREE MEN IN A BOAT. The sequel is not unreadable, but it is a considerable disappointment after the glorious earlier novel.The great thing about THREE MEN IN A BOAT is that after you have read it, you can go back to your favorite parts and reread them whenever you feel like it. Or read any part at all. The plot really isn't very important. The narrative voice is all. And everyone is going to have their favorite lines. Mine could well be when the narrator remarks, &quot;I am fascinated by work.

Narrator J. provides deadpanned insights that are just as true today of modern travelers and vacationers as they were of our Victorian predecessors.

Although it is supposedly comedic I found absolutely nothing slightly humorous in it. Of course, since it was written 100 years ago comedic tastes have changed, but it is hard to believe anyone ever saw any humor here. The words silly and sophomoric come to mind. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is short and as such did not waste too much of my time."},{"Title":"Three Men in a Boat + Three Men on the Bummel","review":"I read this book because it was referred to repeatedly in &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; by Connie Willis which I thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, I can't see what she liked about it. In fact, I was so bored I couldn't get through the second book, and I rarely fail to finish a book. There is no real story, and the episodes which are supposed to be amusing just aren't. Unless you are really passionate about unimportant victorian literature, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Within the Tides","review":"These are not Conrad's most famous stories: Until I read the book, I had not heard of any of them. Nonetheless, this is one author whose worst work is better than most others' best. On a recent plane trip to Seattle, I found two of the four stories merely diverting, and the other two equal to his best.&quot;The Partner&quot; is a grim tale of human weakness spiralling down to a predictable horror; whereas his humorously baroque &quot;The Inn of the Two Witches&quot; reminds me in its tone of Washington Irving in LEGENDS OF THE ALHAMBRA, though set in a later time period.What happens when you fall so deeply in love so fast that you can't act to save your life? Conrad gives his answer in &quot;The Planter of Malata,&quot; in which a successful loner named Renouard confronts the yawning vastness of an empty life. Felicia Moorsom is a bit two-dimensional and a prim and proper Victorian to the nth degree. This tale is a psychological thriller that does not let you breathe until the last line.The final tale -- &quot;Because of the Dollars&quot; -- is my favorite. It reminds me of ALMAYER'S FOLLY and OUTPOST OF THE ISLANDS with its shallow-draft vessels penetrating into the heart of remote islands. Captain Davidson is a classic Conrad hero caught in a trap: How he manages to escape it at the cost of a wife who doesn't love him and, by the way, his ability to smile is one of the author's most perfectly taut stories.It is amusing to read Conrad's preface to the stories: He seems to be wincing excessively in response to early criticism after circulating the stories to his friends. Needless to say, his friends were over-critical: WITHIN THE TIDES struck me as a treasure that I had somehow overlooked all these years."},{"Title":"Within the Tides","review":"Leavis called this \\"shockingly bad magazine stuff\\" (The Great Tradition), but I don't think it can so easily or contemptuously be dismissed. I would describe it as middling work, in between Conrad's best work and his worst work. Though Conrad's lens is somewhat dirtier than in his most famous works, his power and cogency are just sufficient to make these stories (the book is composed of four stories) worth reading. His educated vision is everywhere in evidence."},{"Title":"Mummy Riddles (Easy-to-Read, Dial)","review":"I think that my students will love this book. They love mummies and they love jokes.

I have heard it argued that they appear only in mathematics, music and chess. The most interesting part of this is that all three require the abstraction of patterns. This book is about a boy (Alex) who learned to play chess when he was four years old and loved to play until he was soundly defeated by an adult named Uncle Hooya. The defeat left a sour taste in his mouth, a literal statement, as he often used treats as chess pieces and ate every piece that he captured. Therefore, he vowed to never play chess again.Alex then went on to try many other things, but after eating some dirt playing football, his mind went back to chess and he joins the school chess club. At first, he repeatedly goes down to defeat against the other members of the club, but eventually he starts to win on occasion. He then is a contestant in a chess tournament, losing his first two games, before he starts winning. The high point is when he plays a relative of Uncle Hooya. By concentrating and thinking of food, he defeats his rival, avenging the defeat that turned him away from chess for so long. The book ends with a top ten list of tips for success in chess.Written for children aged 4-8, this is a parable about life with the points being made via chess. One defeat should never end your involvement in something you enjoy and the strategies for success listed by the coach of the chess club can be applied to any field of human endeavor.

My favorite part was when the knights acted like real horses, galloping across the board and jumping over other pieces.Helen Iorga, 2nd grader"},{"Title":"Alex and the Wednesday Chess Club","review":"The core of this story is formulaic (kid suffers setback, kid gives up, kid bounces back, kid finds success). But it was written by someone who obviously understands the world of scholastic chess, and chess is therefore more than a parable for the lessons of life: it is the central feature of the story. The humor and moral are subtle and understated; while they clearly went over the \\"kid reviewer's\\" head, it's easy to see why from the sense of humor he displayed in his review. Other readers should not be thrown off the scent by someone who didn't get it. Kids should be attracted by Alex, who finds something he likes to do, decides to stick with it, and perseveres to succeed even though he fails several times beforehand. But this is as much a book for adults as kids: a sly tribute to a mother who understands both the benefits and the attractive power of chess and who was wise enough to \\"put up with\\" junk food, missing chores, and an ego funk in order to get Alex hooked on the game. Smart woman!"},{"Title":"Alex and the Wednesday Chess Club","review":"My grandson, named Alex, is learning to play chess - this is a wonderful book for him."},{"Title":"Alex and the Wednesday Chess Club","review":"Alex loves junk food.

The impact that nursing education has on these two phenomena is seriously being investigated as a possible cause and cure to these problems. Nursing education, as the book points out, has always been teacher-centered. Nursing educators also act as the one to promote the nurse into the profession or stop the student's progression. This traditional role is spelled out clearly by Nancy Diekelmann and the other writers in their book, Teaching the practitioners of care: New pedagogies for the health professions. In a profession where curriculum is geared towards developing interpersonal skills and working in groups, students find themselves in an environment that is competitive and isolating. The student's relationships with facility are reported characterized with fear, anxiety and anger.Interpretive pedagogies, individually known as critical, feminist, phenomenological, and postmodern pedagogies, are a particular approach to schooling, learning, and teaching where the focus is placed on students and teachers working to together to learn in community oriented activities. This book uses research and nursing stories to portray a learning climate where these varieties of interpretive pedagogies weave a smooth transition to a new landscape of learning and teaching in nursing. Interpretive pedagogies promote both student and teacher learning. In nursing, which is quickly changing, this method of education provides for a constant flow of valuable knowledge.I believe the role of the teacher will become more general, helping students find, interpret, and apply information, instead of the traditional subject matter expert. The educators in the health care professions can look to books like this for valid guidance.I found myself pondering new thoughts and questions regarding my history of having once been a student nurse. I have to agree with the description of the traditional nursing curriculum of being teacher-centered which fostered isolation, fear and anxiety. Reading this is an explorative journey for the nurse and for nurse educators. It leaves the reader with hope that nursing education can rise to the challenge to integrate new pedagogies. I would recommend this book for the serious reader of educational philosophies."},{"Title":"Montana: Off the Beaten Path (Off the Beaten Path Montana)","review":"I used this guide for a trip across southern Montana. The guide pointed me to such off-beat delights as the Road Kill Cafe (\\"from your grill to ours\\") in tiny McLeod, a place you won't find listed in most guidebooks. Another place you won't find in most guides is \\"The Big Open,\\" a 15,000 square mile chunk of lonely land in the middle of Montana. The greatest attraction of The Big Open is the lack of attractions -- which makes it a place I'd like to go one of these days.The guidebook divides Montana into five regions and lists interesting places to stay, old-time restaurants, museums and art galleries, annual events, and assorted trivia. Sidebars recount tidbits of Montana's history, especially tales of its cowboys and Indians.

Dr. Mackal gives fascinating accounts of his many expeditions in search of mysterious zoological mysteries. Everything from lake monsters to surviving flying dinosaurs is covered. The chapters covering the Buru (an aquatic lizard) and the Mokele Mbembe (a possible surviving pachiosaur) are especially fascinating. Written in a professional, factually-based tone, it is incredibly interesting reading. This work rivals Bernard Heuvelman's classic 'On the Track of Unknown Animals' in it's importance to the study of cryptozoology.

He is one of the early serious researchers with substantial (= doctoral-level) credentials in the biological sciences. He writes with authority and is most comfortable sharing many an anecdote. Unfortunately, IMHO, Roy devotes too much attention to classical field work and anecdotal evidence for the animals in question without contributing a whole lot of conjectural analysis about the cryptids' possible interrelationships with heretofore catalogued fauna. (That means \\"known animals\\" but sounds much more learned! Little would you suspect that I'm just a humble hotdog vendor with scarcely sufficient brainpower to correctly don a newly purchased pair of flip-flops [j/k].) By way of contrast, I always feel that Dr. Shuker is pulling out all the stops to justify, fortify, and, frankly, electrify me with his hard work and even harder thinking.

Hopefully volume 4 of the series will reprint the last 5 of the Four Color issues."},{"Title":"Little Lulu Volume 1: My Dinner With Lulu","review":"The numbering and publishing order of Dark Horse's \\"Little Lulu\\" series is rather confusing. Although \\"My Dinner with Lulu\\" was their third release, it is labeled Volume #1 in the series. This is because it reprints the first comic \\"books\\" featuring the character; Dell Four Color #74, #97, #110, #115, #120 (published over a two year period, 1945-1946). All 52 pages of content from these five books is included, unfortunately the covers and advertisements are not. And the reprints are black and white, which makes the volumes very affordable if poor substitutes for the original four-color pages.John Stanley did all the pencils and some of the inking for these five books, in partnership with Irving Tripp. Cartoonist Marge Buell created the characters in 1935 for the Saturday Evening Post and the early comic books had to secure her approval before publication. Judging from the obvious style differences, it is likely that several of Buell's multi-panel one-page SEP stories were included in the comic books and reprinted in this volume.The 1945-46 drawings are more faithful to Buell's style than later Lulu issues. Note that the characters' mouths are only shown when they are speaking and they have only a single eyebrow line going across their foreheads. Despite this both Buell and Stanley are able to convey an amazing number expressions and emotions.Do you know why Tubby calls himself the Spider? It's because he spins a web to catch his prey.Then again, what do I know?

True, it's a little disappointing that the strips are reprinted in black-&-white and not in the original color versions, but the real genius of these works is in the draftsmanship of artists John Stanley and Irving Tripp, and once you get onto their wavelength, even these half-size B&W reprints are a pure delight. They can say so much with such economy -- a single panel of Lulu's unbridled mischief can have you laughing your head off, and here, in this multi-volume collection, you've got a real treasure trove of some of the best graphic-art humor produced in the 20th Century.

It was really great! Dahl's stories are orinal, witty, and strange enough to make things really interesting.

It is really unlike anything I have ever read before and it is sure to spark your imagination whether you are young or old."},{"Title":"The Umbrella Man and Other Stories","review":"This book is for any Dahl lover. These are his writings before he was a children's author. Some of the stories are very funny, while one made me very sad. My favorite was about a man who will trade his pinky for a car.

This book can be read by all ages, so pick it up now."},{"Title":"The Umbrella Man and Other Stories","review":"Evidently, this book (probably because it is written by Roald Dahl, creator of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory) is going to be interpreted as being for children. But the collection of stories within is truly an adult piece of fiction. Splendidly written, each story gives some insight into human nature, or perhaps into ourselves. While reading this, we must look inside ourselves, inside how the book makes us feel, and what how we feel shows about ourself. A must-read for people of all ages. (P.S.: If you're an avid Dahl lover like me, you might've seen some of these stories already. That's all right--you're bound not to have seen all, or even most of them.)"},{"Title":"The Umbrella Man and Other Stories","review":"Simply an amazing book. Roald Dahl does have quite the reputation for creating children's books, but this is no child's book. Each story is so brilliant that you would think there were several decades of planning put into each one. A few will leave you frightened, some will leave you gasping, some might leave you roaring with laughter, and others will have you feeling sad.But I assure you, no matter what feeling these stories leave you with, each and every one will be accompanied by satisfaction.Roald Dahl was a saint when it came to children's books, but if you haven't read any of his Young-Adult (I like to call them) classics, then you have no idea what true literature is. I also recommend some of his other non-children's books, such as, one of my favourites: Going Solo."},{"Title":"The Umbrella Man and Other Stories","review":"Though Roald Dahl's reputation comes mostly from his children's books, these stories, though mostly aimed at adults, are worth reading. This book is full of short stories with somewhat bizarre twists to them, though they are enjoyable all the same. My favorites are Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat, The Butler, The Landlady, Parson's Pleasure, The Umbrella Man, Vengeance is Mine Inc., and Taste.In Vengeance is Mine Inc., Two brothers named George and Claude move to New York with only four hundred and fifty dollars. When they run out of money, they become desperate. Then, Claude gets an idea. The brothers start a company called Vengeance is Mine Inc., which sends out letters to rich people who have been insulted in the newspapers, offering to punch the offensive columnist them in the nose, black their eye, put a rattlesnake (with venom extracted) in their car, or kidnap them, take off their clothes (except for underwear), and dump them on fifth street at rush hour.After just two days of sending out letters, they already have to punch someone in the nose, put a rattlesnake in someone's car, and kidnap someone (with the above specifics). Do you want to know if they succeed? If you do, you'll have to read the book.However, if you do decide to read the book, you will end up reading a lot of other great stories in addition to this one. The endings are just as varied as the topics of the stories. Several are slightly gruesome, others are very interesting, and one of them is very sad. Generally, though, they turn your expectations inside out and upside down, with witty (though sometimes outdated) humor and clever plot lines.

Although the nudes are modestly and tastefully done, these images would be &quot;R&quot; rated in the movie theater.Francesco Scavullo is best known for his portraits and fashion photography. He is one of the best known photographers to emerge in those fields around the time that Richard Avedon was becoming popular. His nudes reflect that strength in the sense that his portrait and fashion-style poses work best. In many cases, the poser's nudity is limited to seeing a neckline and shoulders unencumbered by the distraction of a line of clothing. For that reason, many of these images don't really seem like nudes at all.This book suffers from three serious problems. First, the page size is extremely small. As a result, the photographs are never very large and sometimes are almost microscopic, when combined into a series over two facing pages. You lose a lot of the effect that way. It's like trying to look at fashion and portraits in Reader's Digest size. The editors made up for this by doing a very fine job of selecting photographs that look awfully good for such small reproduction sizes.Second, there simply are not that many images in the book. To get a fully satisfying flavor of Mr. Scavullo's work would have required at least twice as many. I do not know if this is because there were few outstanding nudes to choose from, or on account of limits imposed by the publisher to keep the price down. If there were not that many high quality nudes available, a better solution would have been to have included fully-clothed shots of similar posings to put the nudes into a context.Third, the work comes across as much too glossy and healthy looking to be real. Despite the claims in the introduction that Mr. Scavullo's strength in these images was to see the &quot;real&quot; person rather than an idealized person, I found most of the images looking much too shiny and vibrant to be anything other than an idealization. The work clearly is designed to be flattering to the poser, as well. There's just a little too much &quot;appeal&quot; put into the shots, like a Las Vegas neon sign. Where humor was put into the images, I found it usually didn't work for me.On the positive side, seldom do I see a book where I like as high a percentage of the photographs as I do in this one. So the editors deserve a kudo.Impressive also was that a nude photograph of Mr. Scavullo appears with his biography. He felt that he should not ask others to do what he had not.So, I gave the book back one star for these positives, raising it from a two star to a three star rating.Even if you do not buy the book, I hope you will have an opportunity to see it and form your own opinions of these photographs. This book presents many opportunities for refining your taste in photography.Here are my favorite images in the order in which they appear:Jay Johnson, 1969 (head and shoulders version)Helmut Berger, 1969 (head version)David Sabedru, 1991Kate Mulder, 1992 (eyes downward version)Dana Patrick, 1990Cindy Crawford, 1990Linda Evangelista, 1990 (series of head shots from behind)Claudia Schiffer, 1992Naomi Campbell, 1989 and 1990Margaux Hemingway, 1975Brooke Shields (color), 1991Wale, 1993 (series)Sterling St. Jacques, (1978) (See if you can do this pose!)Sandy Spener and Karla Wolfangle (color), 1971Hiram Keller, 1969I suggest an exercise in visual image-making for you to follow on from what you have seen in this book. Begin with a bare table. Then begin adding still life elements until it seems the most &quot;real&quot; to you. As you add the elements, feel free to change the compositions to learn what causes you to see a more &quot;real&quot; scene. Make some notes of what you learn, and take photographs that you can attach to the notes.Then come back to this book about two weeks later, and see how you would have changed the posings, the make-up, and lighting of these images to have made them more &quot;real&quot; for you.Seek truth, as well as beauty. Otherwise, you will always be overwhelmed by the sheen of attractiveness . . . and miss the beauty that comes from stark openness."},{"Title":"Scavullo Nudes","review":"I admit I'm not a fan of Scavullo, but I like to think that I have an appreciation of the work. There are some tremendous images here, but overall there is just something missing. It's difficult to pinpoint, but there is very little emotion that I felt coming from these shots. I've seen more of his work that actually moved me. None of these had that effect. It's not bad and from a technical standpoint it's okay.

If the prose in HOMEFIELD is any indication of his ability as wordsmith, he certainly deserved that award. Richter's sonata is a harmonic blend of disparate voices telling a story that is more truth than fiction. The characters are richly layered,powerful, and authentic.Cal Parsons is a country boy turned radical protestor, on again off again college student, and political refugee. A self-described draft dodger and road tramp, he returns to his rural Nebraska roots. His anti-establishment, anti-war rage has died out. Cal takes comfort in the simple familiarity of open fields, the west wind, and azure sky He finds shelter on the farm where his aging Uncle Karl and Aunt Martha labor endlessly at tasks city folks could not imagine. And, sadly, he finally finds love in the person of an old friend's wife.Karl, in his 70's, can quietly and capably outwork any 20-year old. He has grown his hair and beard long in stoic protest of injustices everywhere. Karl's battered hands are his history, the time tellers of his life, and his mind a living instruction manual for all things mechanical. Martha has been his short, round helpmate through life, staunch advocate of family and lifetraditions. She cooks, takes pride in their home, raises a huge garden, cans fruits and vegetables, and keeps Karl's life on an even keel.Buckwheat Van Anders has been Cal's friend and blood brother since boyhood. Even as a crippled veteran of Vietnam, Buckwheat's voice is powerful and he has more going for him than most. All Cal's old friends since childhood lend their voices to the HOMEFIELD sonata, but Buckwheat's profanely honestphilosophy was a stand out.The truths told in HOMEFIELD brought smiles and laughter, but also made my stomach hurt and my heart ache. Dying farm towns. An endlessly floundering agricultural economy. Horror and wounds that never really heal despite the passages of time. Loving and making love. Hunkering down and riding outrough times.. Death and sorrow. It's all within the pages of this book, detailed in Mr. Richter's skillful prose.Recommended reading for adults and mature adolescents. This was a beautiful story, well written."},{"Title":"Homefield : Sonata in Rural Voice","review":"This is almost a one-of-a-kind novel, set in the high plains of western Nebraska, where the North and South Platte Rivers join, a farming community of Lutherans and Catholics, in the mid-1970s. Its two central characters are young men of the Vietnam generation, boyhood friends, one of them now a veteran of the war, injured by friendly fire, the other a draft resister, returning after several years of living in Mexico. They and several friends band together for a summer of playing fiercely competitive softball against teams from neighboring towns, drinking beer, and struggling with varying degrees of success to make the most of lives disoriented by the recent war and an ongoing small-farm crisis.It's rare to read a book that so vividly captures the experience of farm work and the personalities of rural people. Richter writes in detail of getting an old self-propelled combine ready for harvest, disking ground, and overhauling the engine of a truck. And he describes with equal thoroughness the playing of ball games and of the men who make up the team. The extremes of weather on the plains also figure dramatically in the novel - a white-out blizzard, summer thunderstorms, and a window-breaking hail storm.Meanwhile, his characters are strongly drawn, and their speech, attitudes, and mannerisms are articulated authentically. The author has an understanding of how rural people bound in time and space to the land and often-limited circumstances adapt their dreams to the opportunities that are available. He also understands that for some this is not enough. In that respect, the novel has an undertone of loss and sadness, which emerges in a poignant scene involving the sale of a farm. I recommend this well-written novel for anyone with an interest in rural lives, farming, friendships, and stories about coming home."},{"Title":"Homefield : Sonata in Rural Voice","review":"This book is definitely five stars. Robert Richter captures the readers attention early on and does a wonderful job of setting the scene of a midwestern town after the end of the vietnam conflict.

This is a very useful work into the difference between leaders who change the world and managers who sustain stability. The two need each other, and here are a few favorite quotes:--Leaders are people who do the right things and managers are people are who do things right. Leaders are interested in direction, visions, goals, objectives, intention, purpose, and effectiveness--the right things. Managers are interested in efficiency, the how-to, the day-to-day, the short run of doing things right.--A manager tends to think of his people in terms of how much they cost and how little he can pay them. A leader tends to think of his people as resources and wonders how much they can earn and how he can help them become heroes.--The manager focuses on systems and structure; the leader focuses on people.The manager relies on control; the leader inspires trust.The manager has a short-term view; the leader has a long-term view.The manager asks why and how; the leader asks what and why.The manager has her eye on the bottom line; the leader has her eye on the horizon.--\\"If you're going to have people connecting with the public, you'd better get extroverts.

The ideas are presented as a lively dialogue between Bennis and Townsend; this format may appeal to some and turn-off others. While we found it added some pizzazz, at times it gets in the way of the content. The book covers such topics as: developing leadership traits, the personal side of leadership, empowerment, and choosing a leader. Also included is a self-development plan. The number of books on leader seems to be infinite but this is one that is informative and worthy of your time.

Neither of them stating what they don't state elsewhere - only with less depth and insight.Very not-worth-it book.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the cliched and predictable plot and characters. Not only did it feel like the writer had just taken a standard chick lit formula, changed some names, added a dash of SAT vocabulary, and forgot to add the vital cup of creativity. What disappointed me the most about the book was that it missed the common element in good chick lit- a protagonist the reader really cares about. The heroine, Francesca Castarelli,had little charcater development except the same tired teenage angst involving boys without the wit that usually accompanies it.You may be asking why I'm so critical of an SAT novel. After all, it's just supposed to enhance vocabulary, right? It's not going to be a bestseller. Yet, the paltry definitions of the SAT words listed at the bottom attest to its uselessness. In some cases, the defintions are even wrong. For example, the word eclectic is defined in the book as meaning selective, when it means to selective or draw from a wide range of sources. The word suggest well- roundedness, not being picky, as the Head Over Heels defintion suggests. Many other defintions are misleading because the author has decided to cut defintions down to one to three words. The novel was also disappointed because, unlike the Marino Mission, another vocabulary enrichment novel, it had no exercises in the back to test your knowledge of the words so you could know whether you were actually absorbing any of the vocabulary.So if you're desparate to learn vocabulary in less than two weeks and aren't picky when it comes to what you read, then I'd suggest buying it. It does have some moments of humor, but they are few and overshadowed by its thin and unoriginal plot."},{"Title":"Head Over Heels: an SAT Vocabulary Novel","review":"The book is about two girls named Fran and Nikki, who are really good friends. The story of the girls shows the hardships for girls in high school. There are two main boys, Jeremy and Luke that have confusion with their feelings towards one another. Also, there is a conflict between the girls' friendship that needs to be worked out. I mainly liked it. There were parts that I didn't like, but they were small. The events that happened to Fran and Nikki are things that happen to most girls when looking for love, so you can relate to the book. While relating to the book, you can work on your vocabulary for the SATS or just for yourself. I felt that it was easy to understand. There are words that I didn't know but they were usually the bolded vocabulary words, which were defined on the bottom of the page."},{"Title":"Head Over Heels: an SAT Vocabulary Novel","review":"Bought this book for my brother's students.

She is having to deal with the SAT, just like most of the readers are as well. Like any other teen novel, some other problems include romance and deciding which boy to choose. As far as the storyline, it was not the best, you could tell some paragraphs were added here or there just to slide another vocab word in. Though, since this is a book meant to help you with your vocab i gave it 4 stars. I felt that not all the vocab words were used completely correctly but i liked how they were defined along the bottom of the page. This made it easy to understand and it does somewhat leave you hanging at times. I would not recommend this books for boys, unless you are desperate, because it is definitely a chick book. It did help me become familiar with the vocab words, but its not where i can memorize them by reading them once. I also bought Busted and Sun-Kissed by the same spark notes authors to help me become even more familiar with the vocab words. (I have not read them yet but the more examples you hear of a vocab word being used, the more familiar you will become with it.) Considering this is a vocab book, it is an okay storyline, but good to see vocab words used in sentences rather than on a flashcard."},{"Title":"Head Over Heels: an SAT Vocabulary Novel","review":"This book was about this girl named Freancesca.

Later that year I watched the other movies in the series, and have loved it ever since. The problem is, so little information was available about the movies. This year I found a number of fan sites, which were great, but still did not give thorough detail of everything from Within The Woods (forerunner to The Evil Dead) to Army Of Darkness. I ended up buying all of the special edition DVDs for all movies and learned a TREMENDOUS amount about the movies, but I still wanted more detail.I heard of this book a few weeks ago and finally picked up a copy last night. So far I've read a little over 100 pages of it, and let me tell you, if you worship Evil Dead, if you MUST know EVERYTHING you possibly can from BEFORE Within The Woods to Army Of Darkness, and want heavy detail, THIS IS IT!For the casual fan, don't waste your time. It will probably be boring to you, as this book is clearly targeted for the hardcore Evil Dead fan.The book includes a number of rare and unpublished pictures (albeit black &amp; white), dates of filming, locations, who did what in all the movies, TONS of behind the scenes pictures and stories, interviews with many of the cast and crew, and A LOT MORE! BTW, I picked all of this up in the first 100 pages, so I'm not even half done with the book yet.MANY pages devoted to how scenes were filmed, equipment used, how camera work was done, how the woods chasing scenes are done, and much more! More detail than on the DVD commentaries!!This book includes a complete filmography for the crew, and even tells of some of their other work as well. From their first super 8 movies long before Evil Dead, up to some of their latest movies, but the bulk of the book is about Evil Dead. There are movie poster pictures, excerpts from Fangoria and other magazines from the early years, newspaper articles, and stories of hardships the cast and crew faced to bring us these movies.Couple this book with the web links in the back, and the special edition DVDs for all movies, and you will have enough Evil Dead knowledge to keep you happy for a long time! The only way you will learn more is to interview Bruce Campbell or Sam Raimi.Suffice to say, if you worship the movie (or are just a really big fan), you will love this book! LOTS of reading!The cover design is pretty cool too. A somewhat 3D necronomicon.Are you a HUGE Evil Dead fan? Then get this book!"},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"It really says something about the quality of this book when most of the reviews can only grumble about that lack of color pictures, or the lack of in depth study given to Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn and Army of Darkness. While the lack of color pictures did not bother me at all, the rather abbreviated look at the making of the two sequels (as well as Raimi's other movies) left me wanting, especially in comparison to the wonderful amount of information in the first half on how this tightly knit team of friends became one of the most beloved cult movie producers of the 1980s and 1990s. Quite literally the books reads like a fly on the wall look at the filmmakers baptism by fire, then it shifts gears to...\\"and they went on to make this, this, and this and lived happily ever after.\\" A little more depth and time about the professional differences in making Dead II and Army of Darkness from the first movie would have been rewarding. Not helping are the concluding chapters which offer nothing but detailed descriptions of the on screen action in the ED trilogy with parenthetical comments by Bruce Campbell. Author Bill Warren refers to it as a DVD commentary on paper. To this reader it just felt like padding. Nonetheless, more than a few fans will find reflections of themselves in this group of movie makers to be and I don't think any admirer of Raimi and Company will want to do without it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"Bill Warren has done a hell of a job with this overview of Sam Raimi's cult-classic film series. Filled with insight into the process of low-budget filmmaking, this book is just as indispensible to Raimi fans as the movies themselves. Flawless!"},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"I am a big fan of the Evil Dead series, and it in fact mad me take note of horror movies for the first time. This book talks about the lives of the creators leading up to the films, the times during the filming,and the difficulties they faced when putting the movies together. it is a well done account of Sam Raimi's early career, his relationship with Bruce Campbell, and his drive to do the movies. It is really just intersting if you are looking to discover what went on behind the making of these 3 great movies, and the effect it had on the major players behind it. I found it difficult to put down, and I really am picky about what I read, as it bores me. this book, though, I found myself reading during class, and had it done in a few days. A really good product for Evil Dead fans, or aspiring filmmakers that happen to be fans of the Evil Dead."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"From Hulka.comMan this book is GREAT! It's a book I wanted to write, and when I heard Bill Warren was writing it, I gave up the idea hoping he wouldn't let me down, and he didn't. He surpassed my expectations! There's so much inside info in this book that you can't find on the net, straight from the horses mouths! Those horses being Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Photos from the films Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness that have never been seen outside the small circle that took them. Great book, I've enjoyed what I've read so far, and I would recommend this sucker be on every aspiring film makers table!This book has limited distribution, so order from Amazon like I did to ensure you get a copy now!"},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"A nice-sized and well-researched tome, author Bill Warren takes readers through the production history of Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD trilogy (and the films in-between) in The Evil Dead Companion. While some folks might tire of the obsessive detailing the book provides about these classic flicks, I can never get my fill of the hometown heroes behind the EVIL DEAD films. Chronologically ordered, a three chapter blow-by-blow summation of the films (annotated by lead actor/co-producer Bruce Campbell) rounds out the book. While The Evil Dead Companion may not be the final word in EVIL DEAD study, it's a damn good start and well worth the investment for folks who think the EVIL DEAD films are altogether \\"groovy.\\" (ISBN: 0312275013)"},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"Like other reviewers for this book, I too am a huge fan of the Evil Dead series. That is why I found 'The Evil Dead Companion' somewhat disappointing, and not worthy of 5 stars at all. Out of all the movies in the trilogy, the author decides to focus mostly on the first film. Granted this is an interesting period in the film-makers lives, I would have preferred just as much in depth coverage into the other two films, 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness'. Unfortunately, they play a small part in the book. The stories of Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell before the films came out are very funny and interesting, and do make up for the lack of other info. Also, the sparse photo's in the book (I really wish there was more) are all black and white, and with a film like this full colour ones would have done far more justice to the films."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"This book is very well written with a great deal of humor to keep it from dragging. It's quite heavily 'Evil Dead'-centric, although the treatment of 'Evil Dead II' and 'Army of Darkness' are still highly entertaining. If you are a fan of any of the movies, or any of the key actors or crew (ie. mainly Bruce Campbell or Sam Raimi), you'll find this quite amusing. I am finding quite a bit of overlap between this book and Bruce Campbell's \\"If Chins Could Kill,\\" but not enough to damage my enjoyment of either one. As a huge Ted Raimi fan, I thought this book was worth buying simply for the three paragraph or so description of how his older brothers used to torment him as a child...Chinese water torture, anyone?? The pictures are also spectacular; black-and-white never hurt anyone before. They give a lot of good behind-the-scenes expressions that would be totally missing if you only watch the movies. Plus, who wouldn't love photos of all the major players as cute little pre-teens... Overall, this book was well worth what I payed for it, and will provide endless reading and re-reading hours of enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"A low-budget wonder that was initially ignored becomes the most famous cult movie in contemporary times and now comes a book tomatch its huge mass appeal. That's really something! The bookaptly titled: The Evil Dead Companion is more ways than one a'companion' itself but a great memorabilia for everyone who remembers the first time they watch this really scary movie. It'sfeels like you're suddenly been a part of its humble and rewarding beginnings. Having been read those struggles makes youappreciate more the three films especially the first one. The effort though in today's standard is not much appreciated becomes the focal point to which Evil Dead fans or any horror fans for that matter look at the horror movies no longer as timewasting efforts but as something as a basis for every one who wants to excel in his field.The cover is very impressive since it uses the almost actual look of the Book of the Dead in the movies. Not to mention the back cover where it gloriously shows two famous pics in the movie: Bruce as Ash in a promo ad and I think the scariest face I've seen in horror movie history (this is the one that made me lose sleep literally!), a Deadite Cheryl. The content really surprises me since I expected that the font are bigger to somehow trick the reader that the book is very extensive. It is and that thickness of the book is reasonable. The pictures become one of the most important aspect in the book. Where else can you find those rare photos? Not even the internet can supply that. A slight drawback for me is that the pics are in black &amp; white. Though it really costs more if it is in color, it wouldn't hurtfor those who buy the book and eventually see the photos in glorious color. The contents are very informative, sometimes funny, that it really helps that author Bill Warren uses chaptersto segments the phases of how these gifted people (Raimi, Campbell, Tapert, etc) came up with this trilogy. It's really funny how they came up with various titles for The Evil Dead. I won't spoil it for you but I assure you the titles are out of this world! A great chapter is the synopses (or lengthy summary)of three Evil Dead movies. Each chapter comes up with the oneEvil Dead movies with side comments to boot. What I'm saying hereis just a tip of the iceberg since there is much to dig for!Frankly speaking, I think the book has to have a sequel, as the movie have, since I feel they have more to tell. But if the second one comes up short in keeping the readers read the book more, forget the idea. How about an all-out rarest of the rare Evil Dead photos book? Ok, I've done much dreaming here but it doesn't hurt to dream, does it?You will never look at the The Evil Dead Trilogy the same way again once you've read this book!"},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"Lots of behind-the-scenes dope on that shady little gorefest, The Evil Dead, and its sequels. More than just a movie production book, it's a tribute (or maybe the basis for a cult!) to a hardworking American filmmaker.

Well, the day was grat to watch an horror movie. But Evil Dead was more than that... Wan an different movie, the scarier... Makes me afraid to walk alone... 'Cause I was goin' home afraid, thinking about that possessed teens, like me, about 20 years, and I imagine me, possessed by the demon... In 1987, there I go again, in the same theater... One very cold day, but it was not raining, but it was night... Evil Dead 2... I was waiting an movie like the first one... It was very good, but not as good as the first one...

Incredible how few good friends, students devoted their time to film making no matter what and made what they dreamed about - kinda horror film for wider audience than this genre usually posses.

Other two thirds is about second film, Army of Darkness and shortly about aftermath - how they were doing after those three films. Book also covers beginnings, how these folks started and when they came together and so on.Well, book mainly for fans and I could even say, for fans this is indeed \\"Must have\\".

The book is chock full of interesting tidbits into the mindset of Sam Raimi - the patron saint of American cinema.Buy this book and you'll find yourself flipping through it over and over again."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"The Evil Dead Companion is about the movie, Evil Dead. If you haven't seen it, you should see Evil Dead II (funnier and not quite as disturbing). Then, if you're drunk, see Army of Darkness. Then come back to this review -- it won't make much sense otherwise.In the bookstore, I picked up the Evil Dead Companion, flipped through it, and put it back down. It seemed mildly interesting, but it didn't have enough to hold my attention. I forgot about it.Then for Christmas, lo and behold, Maleficent bought it for me. So I figured it'd be worth a good read, especially in fleshing out my D20 Modern supplement, Evil Dead: Swallow This! If you don't know what that is, 1) shame on you, 2) visit my web site for more details.Bill Warren's a fan of Raimi and Bruce and co. A big fan. In fact, he's so much of a fan, there's a slant to the material that wasn't quite hard-hitting enough for my tastes. I submit this evidence at the end of the book:These guys from Detroit are among the most decent, likeable people this writer has ever met, and it has been an enormous pleasure, one of the greatest of my professional life, to have been associated with them.Okay, WHOA. I really like Bruce Campbell. When I finally do meet him, I'll proably make a stuttering idiot of myself. But come on now. Even if this is true, and I'm sure it is, would you be quite so effusive with the praise?Also, a good chunk of the book -- pages 180 through 251 -- is a summary of the script with commentary from Bruce. Some if it's interesting. Some of it is irritating in its lack of specifics. It's not the REAL script, it's a summary.But I'm griping about things that ultimately should be meaningless to a true-blue (true-red?) fan of Evil Dead. The book actually is more about the first movie, Evil Dead, than Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness because...well because that's what Sam and Bruce wanted to talk about most.The stories are funny. Sam takes a wicked glee in abusing Bruce. And the early days of filming were hell -- literally and cinematically. The behind the scenes stuff is interesting.The writer makes a half-hearted attempt to make the book an inspirational tale. The idea being that if Sam can do it, you can do it. But that isn't true at all. These friends were all connected to other people who were hell-bent on making movies too. In short, the average hopeful filmmaker is probably NOT working with a bunch of other guys who were ultimately making it on their own. In my experience, the average filmmaker is a kid in a basement trying to film stuff on his own. Sam and Bruce were talented guys with a level of desperation and daring most sane people aren't willing to go. And oh yeah, they don't appear to have had long-term relationships at the time either.The book's becoming rapidly outdated. I checked all the web sites listed in the back and over 50% of them are gone. The game mentioned, Hail to the King, came and went.In short, if you're an Evil Dead fan, you will enjoy this book. A lot of the quotes are taken from other sources vs. interviewing (I can write a book that way too, duh), but there's enough hidden gems that make it worthwhile. If you're not that big a fan, this book will probably bore you pretty quickly."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"As a fan of the Evil Dead movies, I felt like I had to buy this book.. because it's the only Evil Dead Trilogy source I knew of..Unfortunately, the book is all black and white, no colored pictures except for the cover and back cover.The book is focused on the first film (which is, in my opinion, the best), but it covers the other ones too.. Unfortunately, I think an awesome trilogy like Evil Dead diserved a better book, with colored pictures and this kind of stuff... The pros are basically that it's the only Evil Dead Movies-only book in here; the cons are mainly because of the black-and-white-only pictures, and because almost half of this book is a transcription of the crew's comments for the movies (which are taken from the serie's DVDs), and this is a waste..But, as Evil Dead fans, I think we should all buy it..."},{"Title":"The Evil Dead Companion","review":"This book tells all about the making of the three Evil Dead movies with the spotlight on how the filmmakers had gone head over heels to make the first one.

Rodgers and his CNN crew--four men total, including security--hunkered down in a used, unarmored Humvee vulnerable to even the smallest of small-arms fire. The reader understands why he feels fortunate to have survived. Rodgers pulls no punches. He felt lucky to be where he was, and he had great respect and admiration for the men he served with. At the time, he apparently believed fully in their mission. But even then, he recognized that a military force well prepared for combat was not ready for its role as occupiers. When he returned to Iraq a year after the fall of Baghdad, he found a land of danger and discontent, where Americans were seen not as liberators but hated infidel invaders. Thus his epilogue becomes almost a disclaimer, raising serious doubts about the ultimate success of U.S. goals in Iraq. This book is slightly marred by a lack of good copy editing. Unimportant but annoying text errors abound. These aren't factual errors, though, and they aren't Walt Rodgers' fault. They must not be allowed to detract from the importance of this vital and otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"Sleeping with Custer and the 7th Cavalry: An Embedded Reporter in Iraq","review":"If anyone wonders why the military in Iraq hates CNN,you only need read this book.

However, after reading his book, I was amazed at his egocentricity and imagined superiority, as well as his condescending attitutde toward our troops, which he takes such great pains to deny. I had expected an insightful decription of his experiences as an embedded reporter, instead what I learned was his stolid anti-Bush opinions. I am not interested in his feelings about George Bush or the rationale behind the Iraq incursion, I had hoped to learn about our troops and their operations. Unhappily, Rodgers appears to be cut from the same cloth as Maureen Dowd and Frank Rich- although they have some good thoughts, they can't be taken as serious because their biases are so blatantly exposed that they cast doubt on even their legitimate observations."},{"Title":"Mosby's Paramedic Textbook","review":"I used the competing Brady Paramedic Text about three years ago and was shocked at the huge number of contradicitions and outright errors in it. I am a National Registry medic but I recently read this Text in preparing for a written exam in another state that does not offer reciprocity. Mosby's book is EVER SO MUCH BETTER. It has a consistency that aids the learner rather than causing frustration. It reads like it was written by one person, whereas Brady reads like it wass written by three dozen people who never met each other. The Mosby book is articulate and does a good job of explaining new and complex topics to learners with diverse backgrounds. It has chapters devoted to many of the \\"new\\" areas of EMS, such as WMD. It makes the difficult topics manageable. For example, the Cardiac chapter, while long, is well written and builds from a clear foundation and focuses on what medics do in the field rather than what cardiologists do in specialty treatment centers.If you have any choice in the matter, take a class that uses this text and avoid those that try to make do with the Brady book."},{"Title":"Mosby's Paramedic Textbook","review":"Greetings,I'm 3 months into a paramedic program and we just happened to be talking about this book today (one of our texts) in class.

Elliott superbly describes and chronicles the history of the British and Spanish exploration and colonization of the Americas, as well as the process whereby both the British American and Spanish American colonial societies brought about their independence from the imperial governments. It is a comprehensive, detailed, and yet highly readable overview of the political, economic, social, military, and religious forces at play in the Americas during the time period. Elliott goes beyond the telling of historical events and facts, to provide analysis and interpretation of why history unfolded as it did. The writing is excellent and clearly reflects a highly learned historian who has the ability to tell history in a an engaging manner. His juxtaposition and comparison of British and Spanish America in a single volume results in a very interesting and stimulating way to learn about the two empires. The book contains very attractive end papers, a number of excellent maps and numerous color plates. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"This was an eye-opener for me as I knew very little on Spain's American territories, besides brief descriptions of some of the conquistadors such as Cortes and Pizzarro. What Elliott has done in this book is to show the comparisons and contrasts between England's New World Colonies and Spain's. There are many fascinating facets underlaying the reasons for acquiring these territories, how both sides viewed their mission and goals, and how they governed them. This is without a doubt a remarkable book that revealed a lot for me.The first colonization was begun by the Spanish in the early 16th Century. The English made their first successful attempt in the early 17th Century. Both South and North America posed different challenges for both governments, i.e. the size of the indigenous populations, the geography and climate, natural resources and so forth. For me, the real fascination was learning more about the Spanish colonies and the establishment of the viceroyalties of New Spain (based in Mexico City) and Peru (based in Lima) with additional ones developing over time. The interaction with the natives, the attempts at Christianization, trade, and many other aspects of Spain's colonization were quite enlightening.Being more familiar with United States history, I felt more familiar with the material covered on England's planting of settlers in Jamestown and later in New England. However, the real education was in Elliott's efforts to show how each of these two powers (Spain and England) confronted the realities and challenges of establishing their presence in these very different regions. The differences were often quite stark. Some of the points of contrast that most differentiated the two powers included each nation's attitude towards the Indians (including the attempts or lack of evangelization) and the extent of imperial bureaucracy brought over from the mother countries.Elliott also describes how world events had helped to shape and or guide the developments that occurred in both country's territories. The Reformation, the British Commonwealth under Cromwell, the Restoration, the Glorious Revolution, the French and Indian War, the French Revolution and so forth, all served as factors in shaping the events that transpired in North and South America. The role of various monarchs, religious, military and political leaders, as well as indigenous leaders, are also discussed.Elliott does try to take an even-handed approach in acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of both government's endeavors. Of course it goes without saying that the notion of empire, with the connotations of exploitation of natives and their cultures, is unpopular in most peoples minds nowadays. Yes, it was and remains a blot on the records of all nations that engaged in replacing the livelihoods and cultures (sometimes more like extermination) of indigenous peoples, or those who engaged in the slave trade, but we must keep in mind that we have to try to keep modern standards in check for historical purposes.This is such a broad subject that I find it hard to even begin to touch on more specific details found in this book; I'm just trying to outline the broader contours of Elliott's book. Having some introduction to this time period will help you, but you need not be an expert on this particular topic. An illuminating read."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the history of the Americas, colonial history or comparative studies of the American countries. Although it is based largely on secondary sources it reflects the enormous amount of work that the author has carried out in his previous books on Spain. The most interestin feature of the book is how Elliott points out the similarities between the British and Spanish Empires in the Americas; a fact that most historians have previously tended to ignore."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"Elliott delivers the masterpiece that those who study the Atlantic World have been waiting for. The idea of studying history from the perspective of the Atlantic has been growing in popularity and worth taking a further look at. Britain and Spain established mammoth empires and Elliot looks at their rise and fall. He also considers other powers including the French and Dutch but focuses mainly on the first two mentioned. The age of exploration is put in context and in true Atlantic fashion the slave trade and development in Latin America are very important. The revolutions of the Atlantic world are very clearly explained in this book and Elliott leaves you wondering where else this field can go. Elliott writes very well and this book is a must read for those who want to consider how the Atlantic world impacted Europe and the United States."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"This well written and well organized book is a careful synthesis of the enormous secondary literatures on colonial British America and colonial Spanish America. Elliott provides a pair of parallel narrative overviews of British and Spanish America from their foundings to the revolutions that severed ties to their home nations. The narratives provide the basis for some comparative analysis that recurs throughout the book.Knowledgeable readers will probably be familiar with much of the narrative about British North America. Much of the information about Spanish North American will probably be new to many readers (like me). For example, the small British settlements of the 17th century were dwarfed by the scope of the Spanish colonial enterprise. When Boston and Philadelphia were modest seaports, Spanish America boasted several large cities. At the time of Harvard's foundation, Spanish America already possessed several universities.Elliott divides this book into three sections; Occupation, Consolidation, and Emancipation. Occupation is devoted to the initial experience of exploration, colonization, and encounters with the native peoples of the Americas. The chapters in Consolidation describe the development of mature colonial economies and imperial government, the challenge of developing European style societies in radically different circumstances, and the sense of identities developed in these new societies. Emancipation describes the 18th century conflicts between the metropolitan centers and the colonies, particularly as London and Madrid attempted to develop closer control and upset traditional arrangements. All chapters are particularly good combinations of political, economic, and social history.Elliott points out the common problems faced by both British and Spanish colonial efforts but also how the different features of the home nations and different circumstances in the Americas produced different outcomes. The Spanish, for example, were confronted with very large native populations that they attempted to incorporate into their empire. This fact, plus traditions inherited from the Reconquista, would contribute to the generation of the very racially differentiated society in much of Spanish America. The existence of enormous silver deposits in Mexico and Peru drove the Spanish Crown to exercise considerably closer control of its colonies than the British monarchy would exercise over its colonies.In his comparative analysis, Elliott deals with the major differences in British and Spanish America, and implicitly how they led to such differing outcomes after the revolutions at the end of the 18th century. Elliott's answers are surprisingly traditional. He stresses the centralized bureaucratic nature of the Spanish empire, the more 'commercial' nature of British settlements, the religious pluralism of the British colonies, and the more liberal/representative political traditions that the British brought with them. Elliott is careful to point out that many of these ultimately beneficial features were essentially inadvertant. If the English crown had been stronger or if rich gold mines had been found in the Blue Ridge mountains, the path of British colonization might well have been closer to the Spanish model."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"In Empires of the Atlantic World, Professor Elliot compares and contrasts Spanish colonial America with British colonial America. I am not aware of any other books that take this is their subject, and I think that it is worthy of attention. Elliot presents 2 very different experiences in terms of government, economy, and culture. For instance, the Spanish conquistadors came upon a very highly centralized political structure, which they were able to penetrate (and co-opt for their own rule) with relative ease. This enabled them to retain the tributary labor system of the Aztecs and Incas, which they labeled the encomienda system. The British in North America did not have the same experience, as the Indians there tended to be far more decentralized. This forced the British to pursue a far different strategy in their efforts at conquest. Also, the scarcity of gold and silver in North America forced the British to diversify the colonial economy, leading to a more developed economic scene.Additionally, I found Elliot's side-by-side discussion (between the British and the Spanish) of various other colonial themes to be well-developed. In particular, he goes into considerable detail in contrasting Spain's Catholic-only policy in the Americas with the religious diversity that existed in the British colonies. At the same time, he also explores the very different attitudes that the British and the Spanish had toward the Indians, and how those differing attitudes shaped political and social orders in the 2 regions (look at the large \\"Mestizo\\" population that exists in many parts of Latin America today, in contrast to the relatively small population within the United States). For instance, the Spanish sought to bring the Indians into the Catholic Church (witness the significant presence of the Catholic Church in the colonies), and even (theoretically) included a measure of legal protection for Indians within the encomienda system. On the other hand, the British did not make christianizing the Indians a high priority, nor did they concern themselves wth any legal protections for the Indians (a notable exception to this was William Penn).Elliot gives a great deal of space to discussing how the political and religious regimes that existed in Great Britain and Spain were transferred to these nation's respective American colonies. For example, the British colonists were nurtured, to some degree, by the growing \\"liberal\\" ideas that were coming out of Great Britain at the start of the 1700s, while Spanish colonists had no such ideas to turn to (at least none in Spanish). Moreover, British control over its colonies was relatively decentralized (many of the colonies were private or corporate, and all enjoyed a measure of self-government), though Spanish colonies were under the tight grip of the Spanish monarchy. Finally, Elliot demonstrates how both Great Britain and Spain began to \\"reform\\" their administrative policies vis-a-vis the colonies, and how those reforms triggered colonial resentment (though the 2 nations had different results in quashing this resentment)."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"Elliot offers us a very solid comparative history of England and Spain in the Americas and attempts to give some answers as to why the great distinctions arose between Latin America and Anglo America. France and Portugal, the two other main European powers active in the Americas, are perhaps short-shrifted in this history, but I don't feel that it was a substantial detriment to the work that those two powers were largely absent from it. He relates both similarities and dissimilarities in the two imperial experiences. For example, both nations were informed by their prior histories of expansion and colonization in their American efforts: England has it's model in Ireland against the native Irish, and Spain in Andalucia against the Muslim population. In regards to differences, Spain's strongest holding in the Americas were those that had previously had relatively strong, populous, native state systems in place (notably the Inka in the Andes and the various states of Mesoamerica), which had not only existing bureaucratic classes that the Spanish crown could rule through and provide stability in the early years of colonial endeavors, but also a workforce that didn't require transport across the Atlantic. As a result, a complex racially-based hierarchy evolved in Latin America, with Europeans at top, Africans and Natives at bottom, people of mixed ethnic (and indeed cultural) background in the middle. England on the other hand colonized land that was more sparsely settled, which meant that labor had to be imported (in the form of African slaves and European indentured servants), which lead to a simpler hierarchy and a more thoroughly European culture in English colonies. Spanish control tended to be more hands-on throughout the Latin American colonial experience, whereas the weaker English state could rarely muster the power to direct its colonies. Elliot essentially argues that the conditions set up by pre-Columbian demographics and altered by European and African diseases led to the social structures which inherited the reigns of power from their former colonial powers, and that the differing attitudes of those powers towards their colonies (and capacities of those powers to direct colonial policy from Europe) strongly shaped how those colonies were ruled after they won independence. Written in a very balances and informative way, but not necessarily in a easy way. It will take you a good deal of time to read this sucker!

I had to read this for a graduate seminar. I was pleased with the text. It was very easy to read and very interesting. Elliot does a nice job of interweving the experience of both the Spanish and English together. Now, I was somewhat skeptical at first because many people make the mistake of questioning why one state could nto accomplish what another could, or why one colony suceeded and another did not. ELliot stays clear of these ridiculous comparisons and quite simply places each expeirence next to each other without any links. FOr example, he doesn't question why the English were not unable to do what Spain had done in terms of land. He simply explains why England's expeirence is different.As a PHD in English hsitory, I really enjoyed thsi book. It is a comparative, but in a way Elliot has combined two books. On one side you have the Spanish experience, and on the other the English....The readeris left to interpret or grasp the difference.If you're not a history major, or graduate student in history, this book is still a great book. It is easy to read and is not bogged down by endless theoretical findings. If you are a history major, either of western European history, US, or Latin American then i would reocmmend this text.P.S.

Upon her arrival, Spain's western possessions were populated by vast pools of indigenous peoples, where intermingling between the new arrivals and domestic peoples became commonplace, resulting, as it did, in a growing number of Creoles (individuals of mixed Indian/Spanish blood). Conversely New Englanders, for the most part, remained congregated in their Protestant clusters, ideologically and socially segregated from their native cousins.At first blush, economic fortunes seemingly shone well on Spain, where a mother load of Peruvian silver, which, in spite of strict mercantile controls by the mother country, fueled a cultural colonial renaissance and resultant growth in universities, cathedrals, and regal cities far larger and exquisite than anything in Massachusetts or Maryland. Silver's blessing, however, also created a false-sense of Spanish invincibility; and it didn't take long for the conquerors to find themselves hard pressed scraping together the necessary resources to police such a vast and increasingly threatened empire. The English, in achieving supremacy over the seas, provided the American colonialists a cushion from outside interference which allowed them the sort of freedom to explore and develop hitherto unknown pluralistic political associations; yet while the English melting pot provided the experimental grounds to reconcile Euro-American inter-cultural and religious conflagrations, it was far less altruistic and tolerant and respectful toward its indigenous neighbors. Ironic as it sounds, one can easily make the case that the more regimented and Spanish regal/clerical hierarchy did far more than its European rival in giving voice to her native peoples.It is intersesting to see how the French, both directly and indirectly, thwarted both Spanish and English hegemony. In the case of the Brits, it was the costs of underwriting the French and Indian War and the mother country's subsequent attempt to have the their colonies pay for that war which provided a key stimulus to the American Revolution. Spain's demise arrived more slowly and subtly; Napoleon's Iberian Peninsula adventures in the the early 1800s estranged Spain from her American colonies, creating in the process political independence in the form of Simone Bolivar."},{"Title":"Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830","review":"This is a great book for an undergrad seminar or lecture on the Atlantic World.

The colonies in America can be easily put into two categories, the Anglo ones and the Catholic ones. Despite small French and Portugues and Dutch intrusions, the overall lesson is one of difference between these two great naval powers and the makeup of their colonial systems.We are given here, perhaps for the first time in a cogent work, a true understanding of the nature of the two regimes. ON the one hand we see the brutality and discrimination of the Spanish empire. How they lopped of hands for gold, how they were anti-Jewish. How they were Catholic. But we see in them a very different mentality, that of mixing with native peoples to in fact create a whole new ethnic group. In the English colonies we see the opposite, early contacts with Indians dont suceed and the colonies immediatly set to bring over women(because of religious diveristy and rebellion against England) and in this we see the creation of the modern system of North and South America.A wonderful and very insightful book that should be of interest for any historian of the period or anyone interested.Seth J.

But only one star? Is this an error?"},{"Title":"Early Mapping of the Pacific: The Epic Story of Seafarers, Adventurers and Cartographers Who Mapped the Earth's Greatest Ocean","review":"\\"The European mapping of the Pacific was at times a mapping of the European psyche,\\" writes Thomas Suarez.The mere fact that the Europeans did it, at such cost, was an aspect of a unique psychological outlook. The people who lived in and around the Pacific never bothered.There were a variety of reasons, some merely technical, for that. For whatever reasons, the indigenes were content with local maps. The drive to know the whole world did not inspire them.The Europeans had crass motivations as well. After 300 years of effort, there were still a few spots unknown to them in 1800 -- and even as a big a place as Hawaii had been found barely two decades earlier. But in the 19th century the quest for \\"sandalwood, trepang, seals, whales and furs\\" exposed every last scrap of land to purchasers of European maps.\\"Early Mapping of the Pacific\\" follows on Suarez's gorgeous \\"Early Mapping of Southeast Asia\\" and will have even more interest for Hawaii readers. Hawaii gets more detailed attention than anyplace else, and it is easy to see that Suarez has spent plenty of time here.He writes that \\"often the mapping and exploration of the Pacific seems the stuff of novels,\\" and his own late entry into the field was, if not novelistic, distinctly unusual.A classical violinist, Suarez was giving concerts way off Broadway -- places like Moen island in Chuuk in Micronesia -- when he became interested in the places, the people, the stories and the maps.For a generation, he's been an authority and consultant on old maps.Even without the detailed text, it is easy and curious to follow the progress -- sometimes regress -- of European knowledge of the Pacific over time.When the Pacific was completely unknown to Europe, the best maps Europe had already showed close correspondence with the shapes and locations of the Caribbean and Africa, though the Caribbean had been unknown 20 years earlier.Often -- not always, by any means -- the Europeans in their restless inquisition acquired accurate maps almost overnight. Even in fairly early maps, some parts of the Pacific begin to look quite familiar, though others remain seriously confused. It took a long time, for example, to learn that Australia and New Guinea are not connected.Even by the time of James Cook, a buyer of maps in Amsterdam or London had to choose between very different opinions about what lay in the Pacific.One topic that Suarez devotes considerable attention to is whether the Spaniards found Hawaii before Cook did in 1779.There are early maps that show islands about where Hawaii is.Suarez is not persuaded that they represent anything more than the other fugitive islands that cartographers in Europe were led and misled to draw on maps even into the 19th century.There is an even stronger argument against Spanish discovery.The maps that show \\"Hawaii\\" show other islands to the east and to the west that we know do not exist, and the accuracy of these maps for the west coast of America is poor also.If \\"Hawaii\\" on those maps is genuine, it is the only part that is."},{"Title":"Early Mapping of the Pacific: The Epic Story of Seafarers, Adventurers and Cartographers Who Mapped the Earth's Greatest Ocean","review":"The author does an excellent job of describing and illustrating key milestones in the mapping of the Pacific region. He integrates the history of exploration and of cartography in an effective manner that adds life to the plentiful and abundant maps that illustrate the text. The book is an excellent introduction for the serious collector of antique maps of the Pacific. Its a beautiful book and informative book, however, it could be a difficult read at times for those less interested in maps or history."},{"Title":"Early Mapping of the Pacific: The Epic Story of Seafarers, Adventurers and Cartographers Who Mapped the Earth's Greatest Ocean","review":"This book of maps and the explanations make it clear how maps and the understanding of them were so important so long ago. So said, it seems that things do not change all that much throughout history: knowledge trumps all. Maps, accurate ones, trumped gold and silver. Marvel in this book for a glimpse into the past. You will never resell this time peace to history."},{"Title":"Early Mapping of the Pacific: The Epic Story of Seafarers, Adventurers and Cartographers Who Mapped the Earth's Greatest Ocean","review":"This is a vast topic and the author has taken on a huge job. He has written a truly excellent text that is technically correct, yet very readable. He has also managed to do somethig very difficult - integrate the text successfully with maps, most of which are illustrated beautifully. So in one work, we have the scholarly interpretation of the history and its integration with the cultural artifacts of such exploration.- the maps. I think one of the chief attributes is that his book has opened so many doors to this subject that it will reman a standard for a very ong time. It is also a beautiful production (although the subtitle sounds like it was written by a desperate English major) and is easily in the fine tradition of Suarez' other books."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"Plumb's broad overview of the Italian Renaissance is married to an uneven collection of essays by various scholars on representative figures of the period. Very much in the old manner historically speaking (which I actually think is a good thing), but not consistent enough to be all that recommendable."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"Plumb's book is a very readable introduction to the Renaissance. He begins by explaining how civilization collapsed after the fall of Rome. But the Renaissance grew from the increases in population, trade and the flow of ideas. Italy was a land of cities instead of feudalism, able to make good use of trade to gain great power. The increase of trade brought power to the merchants and guilds instead of the nobility. Trade and power brought money to support an explosion of the arts and finance the flow of ideas, especially from the past.Plumb describes the histories of some of the cities of Italy. In one chapter he describes the intricate diplomacy of Milan. In other chapters he describes the commerce of Venice and the trade of Florence. We see the brilliance of artists and dissipation of rulers. Plumb describes how the new learning, the new way of seeing the world, spread across Europe.However, Plumb only wrote half of the book. The second half contains a series of biographies of great artists and rulers of the Renaissance, written by different authors. There are short biographies of artists such as Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci: rulers such as Lorenzo de Medici and Doge Foscari, and authors such as Petrarch and Machiavelli. This book is a tour de force introduction to the magnificent Renaissance."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"This book is informative, intelligent, and so well written that it can have a strong appeal to the reader sheerly as literature. It is also a funny book. All the intrigues, treacheries, betrayals, and cruelties perpetrated by the pillars of the Renaissance society (popes, politicians, eminent soldiers) are described so naturally, vividly, and, sometimes, unexpectedly that I could not help but laugh when reading about them.Plumb knows how to go straight to the point and give the reader his insights clearly and unobtrusively. He does not preach, he simply states and gives facts so wonderfully that I could not help but admire his masterful style of presentation. Here is an example: &quot;In the darkest decades, there was a froce at work--trade--that was inimical to this world of warriors, priests, and peasants. Trade drew Moslem, Jew, and Christian together; trade fattened towns, sometimes bred them.&quot; Notice with what facility Plumb has just outlined the importance of trade--it mitigates cultural barriers and draws people together on the basis of mutual business interests. Or, here is an example of how Renaissance confronted dogmatism and obsession with getting at truth by deductive reasoning: &quot;The old dogmatic certainties did not vanish at once, and the habit of trying to nail truth down by argument from fundamental principles was not lightly cast aside. Some of the most original minds, however, particularly Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci, sought truth not in argument but in observation.&quot; The book is full of such gems.Renaissance was strange, cruel, and full of life and culture. This book gives us Renaissance in all its splendor fitting to a description of the time of revival and vitality."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"I was surprised how easy it was to read The Italian Renaissance. Some history books are an effort to read, but this one was such a breeze I got myself caught up in it, and finished it in only a day or two. The first half of the book is by Plumb, which goes over the principal cities and themes of the Renaissance. The second half is a mix of biographies of prominent figures of the period by different authors - but there isn't much of a difference between these pieces and Plumb's half in style, both are wonderful to read. This book was so good I've bought a few more in the American Heritage series. If you want a good survey of the Renaissance in Italy, than this is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"Plumb's work is very readable and paints an overview of the Italian Renaissance with a broad brush. It is, however, 47 years old (published 1961). There's been an enormous amount of scholarship in those 47 years, and Plumb is showing his age, in his adulatory tone and his dismissive insults about the European Middle Ages."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"I wish there were more books like this one. The first half is discussion by J. H. Plumb about many basic aspects of the Italian Renaissance one should know, the second half is a collection of well-written biographical essays about prominent Italian Renaissance figures. The second half was particularly good. I think Kenneth Clark's essay on Michaelangelo and Morris Bishop's on Petrach were the best, but they were all very good. All are well written, unpretentious and intelligent, and all concern interesting people.The notable figures of Renaissance Italy are really quite different from notable figures of the American Revolution, say. They were much more passionate. The good better, the evil were more evil. Men loved works of art, they didn't just pretend to. I was reading about Benedict Arnold recently, deplorable traitor! but for diabolical rogues, he's nothing beside Cesare Borgia or Sigismondo Malatesta. And who can compare with Federigo da Montefeltro? Or Leonardo da Vinci? They're inspirational. They make you want to live.Anyway, this is great book. I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"What an intriguing book! I have a degree in art history so the Italian Renaissance is nothing new to me. I so enjoyed this book! It is written for a reader that is somewhat familiar with the time & people, but it goes into detail to clairfy. This was a great read!"},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"The text by mr. Plumb is very entertaining. The images do not add much to the value of the book. The second part of the book, consisting of monographs on individual personalities, written by several scholars, was a much less enjoyable read. On the whole: informative."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"I ordered this book for a 12 year old who is fascinated with the Italian Renaissance. I was slightly worried that the Book might be too \\"old\\" for him. After receiving the Book I went through a lot of it. It is great reading for any one who has a special interest, including a 12 year old. The addition of various writers on specific persons makes this book even more interesting."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"It was slow in starting, but once it got rolling, this book was terrific! The first several chapters sounded like the \\"hype\\" you hear in television commercials for upcoming action flicks, and the style got old after only a few pages. Once the book really began, however, it was excellent through to the end. Plumb and his fellow authors do not shy away from the most terrible and disgusting aspects of the Renaissance, such as the revival of pederasty and the rampant adultery committed by middle class men, nor do they fail to give praise where praise is due. You get a real feel for the Renaissance and the great personalities, achievements, and events of the period. The last few chapters, which cover several of the greatest individuals of the Renaissance, are particularly good. They lead the reader to a real appreciation for the people of the Renaissance, a real understanding of what makes them tick, and an empathy for each of them as a person. This book taught me to love the Renaissance."},{"Title":"The Italian Renaissance","review":"This is a great book for anyone with an interest in the Italian Renaissance. The book is divided into 2 parts, the first part being a general historical account, moving over subjects such as the arts, the princes, and so on, while the second part is a series of biographical portraits of important characters of the Italian Renaissance (written by various authors). The book is easy to read, easy to follow, packed with information, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"The book is an interesting read. While it definitely has elements of the old South, it is first and foremost a soap opera. The historical setting provides the backdrop for the story of the wealthy, prestigious Kendrick family and their many loves, mistakes, heartbreaks, and joys. The only similarities this book has with Gone with the Wind are the historical setting and the main protagonist's grit to survive during the upheaval of the Civil War. However, the focus of Gone with the Wind is on survival while the focus of Beulah Land is more on relationships between characters. The time jumps in Beulah Land often were frustrating as I wanted to read how the Kendricks survived rather than have it explained to me later in the book. However, it is an enjoyable read as you do want to stick with the book to see what will happen next with the characters."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"I loved this book about the Kendall's right before and during the Civil War. This book is a sweeping saga that keeps you up at night and alert during the day!! Read this book if you love books about the southern familes during the Civil War. Some parts are graphic and heart wrenching but worth the read!!!"},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"This was the first time that I've read a book by Lonnie Coleman. I picked it up because it was a story about the southern states and slavery before the war between the states. I liked the book. The characters were believable and the story line was good. It was fun to read."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"As other reviewers have said, this is a soap opera set in the antebellum south. It's strength lies in its details about plantation life of the time. That is really the only plus I came away with from the book.Where the novel fell down for me was in its character development and style. Too often the reader is told what has happened instead of being shown. The most glaring examples concerned the deaths of several characters. The worst involved a main character introduced at the very beginning of the book. I don't want to give too much more away, but the way it was handled was bizarre. The people most affected were not shown to be affected.Some of the characters--Selma in particular--seemed completely pointless. Most of them are not three-dimensional and the primary female protagonist is almost too good to be true. She's a true soap opera victim.There were some lovely descriptions, I did have a solid feel for Beulah Land itself, but most of the people living there made little meaningful impact."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"I'm giving this one 3.5 stars, mostly because of all the hype on the cover that this was a Southern-plantation saga on par with Gone With the Wind. (The Chicago Tribune raved that this was \\"Gone with the Wind....with sex!\\" ha)It is indeed a saga about the Georgia plantation Beulah Land and it's owners and slaves. The story begins in the early 1800s and we're introduced to the first generation at Beulah Land. There are, of course a myriad of family members, slaves, and folks from the adjoining plantations.The years roll by and the book covers all the way to 1861, so around three generations worth of marriage, betrayal, children, etc, all things saga-related.I'm only able to give it 3.5 stars because it just couldn't sustain my interest all that much. Yes, it's more explicit than Gone With the Wind, but I honestly could have done without the sex....it just was written icky. There didn't seem to be one single healthy relationship amongst the lot of them. You'd think that with at least 30 characters, one or two of them might have a healthy, happy marriage? And speaking of sex, I'm not going to write a spoiler, but there is one particularly very nasty part (and I am super liberal when it comes to sex in books) that made me put the book down for a couple of hours. Ewwww. And can I just complain that every single reference, and there were dozens of them throughout the book, to a man's genitals used the word \\"dick\\"? How inventive.I would have eventually tossed the book aside were it not for the occasional moments of sheer brilliant writing. As is normal for plantation-style sagas, there's a lot more telling than showing...and that's okay with me because that's where some of the best writing was.Here's an example:\\"Leon was too young to accept the idea of growing old, and he was too old to hope that life held anything new and wonderful for him in the future.\\"I mean, how great (and true) is that? There are scores of lovely gems like that scattered throughout, but it just wasn't enough to rescue the book for me.This is the first of a trilogy by this author, but I doubt I'll be reading the remaining two."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"This story covers about 60 years (1800-1861) through the generations of the black slaves and white masters of the plantation Beulah Land. The story itself was interesting, but the writing was clunky in some parts and could have been polished/edited better.The story goes in several installments, named after the time they were set in (1800, 1853, 1828, etc) and many characters get voices in the story - white and black people, along with mixed-breeds like Roman. If the author had been more careful with some parts and writing, this story could have been truly memorable. Nonetheless, it was still a fairly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"The series of Beulah Land books are better than gonewith the wind. They are more realistic and historical.I highly recommend these books by Lonnie Coleman!"},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"The book was not quite as nice as I thought it would be, but is still an excellent value.

It is a family saga with wonderful characters and complex relationships. The sights and smells and sounds of the old south are vivid, and there are some wonderfully poignant moments of connection between characters that are beautiful. I read the whole trilogy, and it's terrific."},{"Title":"Beulah Land","review":"Some may refer to this book as an inflation of Gone with the Wind, but it is my opnion, that these books are two totally different reads. The only paralell that I can sumise, is that both stories take place in the South.Margaret Mitchell, was (although not considered by her contemporaires in her youth) a Lady, and being such, she wrote as one. I love the tale of Scarlett and Rhett. It is a true classic.This book is not in any way, an \\"inflation\\" of Margaret Mitchell's story. This book stands proudly on its own two feet.Seasoned with contemptable characters, sex (and while the situations are quite explicit), and situations, I proudly rate this book with a four star rating.In reading this book, do not compare it to Gone with the Wind. Read it as a totally different book, with fresh characters. It is well written, and the chapters are quite short (I like this because you don't feel commitment to read pages and pages and pages to get to the end of the chapter), and it is, in and of itself, as southern as a Mint Julep. To be taken slowly, and each page to be savoured upon...Read this book...you will be very glad you did!Gone with the WindRhett Butler's People"},{"Title":"The Punisher Vol. 5: Streets of Laredo","review":"Covering Marvel Knights issues #27-32 and issue #19, Streets of Laredo is the fifth MK Punisher graphic novel. It's by no means the weakest offering, or the strongest. This is mostly due to the hodgepodge of art work. Three artists contribute- Steve Dillion, of Punisher, Preacher, and Hellblazer fame, Cam Kennedy- former Judge Dredd artist, and Tom Mandrake- Spectre, Call of Duty. Dillion's art provides the faming issues, and perhaps this is a mistake. We go from his crisp style to Mandrake's art, which tends to look like Tim Sale's of late. Then Cam Kennedy provides most of the art. While I enjoy Cam's work on other books, I felt as if it were less than perfect for this character, this story.Speaking of stories, the writing is deep, dark, disturbing and wonderfully funny all at the same time. Only Garth Ennis can pull that off with any regularity at all. Any fan of Ennis should love adding this volume to their collection.On a personal note, my two favorite stories were #19, which marks the return of Joan (and Joan's pies) and #32 which is the dubious origin of Detective Soap. The volume is worth adding to your collection for these two stories alone. When reading #19 note that the expressions on Frank's face and Frankie the Dog's face are often the same.Over all, a very good book that is well worth the money. Highest recommendations!"},{"Title":"The Punisher Vol. 5: Streets of Laredo","review":"Fact one: Garth Ennis is a superb writer when allowed to push the limits that he is known for (don't believe me, check out the Preacher comics). Fact two: his run on the Punisher is the best storytelling to hit the character in years. However, this four part storyarc is far from the best work to come from Ennis, but not all the blame can be contributed to him. When allowed to go over the limits of what can be done in a comic, Ennis' true talent shines, but when he is restricted (this is a PG+ book after all) his storytelling suffers, and it shows here. Not only that, but Cam Kennedy's art grates on the nerves quite a bit. I just can't get into it; his misshapen character models are an acquired taste to say the least. I mean his look of the Punisher just doesn't stick well; artists like Steve Dillon and Tom Mandrake have done far better than Kennedy. All that aside however, this is a solid storyarc that is still worth reading for Punisher fans. The story finds our favorite criminal killing vigilante in the desolate Texas town of Branding trying to stop the flow of illegal military weapons from leaving the town. We are introduced to a flat villain and one dimensional characters, something that is shocking to say the least to come from the pen of Garth Ennis. Streets of Laredo is so far the worst of Ennis' run on the Punisher, but this is still better than most comics out there today."},{"Title":"The Punisher Vol. 5: Streets of Laredo","review":"Starting with a moving story featuring Joan (last seen in \\"Welcome Back, Frank\\") and ending with a bittersweet (yet sometimes hilarious) origin tale for Soap; Garth Ennis has found a way to mix some beauty in with the carnage. In the middle, we have the Punisher doing what he does best. There's a crossover with Elektra with a body-count high enough to make Freddy and Jason blush. The mystery in The Streets of Laredo is too easily solved, but there are some interesting characters introduced and a very welcome (and unexpected) touch of social commentary. This is the best of the Marvel Knights Punisher titles."},{"Title":"The Punisher Vol. 5: Streets of Laredo","review":"I love this book because it was written by Garth Ennis who doesn't mind writing about violent material. I hope he continues to write more Punisher titles to further my comic book vigilante collection."},{"Title":"The Punisher Vol. 5: Streets of Laredo","review":"Much like the other stories by Garth Ennis and crew, this book contains jsut as much fun, killing, and sympathy, as the others. The content of the writing is fine but the whole concept of the mystery of the Streets of Loredo is knida stupid and predictable. Another flaw in this book is it's art. The artwork, which is mostly by Cam Kennedy is simply awful and doesn't fit the Punisher's style at all. Most of his charcters seem to look the same and have distorted faces and straw-like hair. Looking at the pictures for too long gives me a headache.In general, this is probably the worst of Ennis run, maybe because he has set high standards for himself, but even so this is at the bottom.Overall, if you are a strong fan of Ennis and collect the Punisher...get the book.If you are a fan of good art (like Steve Dillon's) then don't even bother."},{"Title":"Seraphim Grosse Pointe","review":"Yes, it's out of print but try to track down a copy, scourge the out of print sections, borrow it from a friend (never give it back) do whatever you have to do--this book is a must for anyone interested in Brazilian Modernismo or outright hilarious reading material. I've read it over and over again along the years and Seraphim Grosse Pointe never ceases to astound me. The book tells the story of Seraphim Grosse Pointe: from his shotgun wedding and the drudgery of a public servant's life to his passionate love affair with a fickle danseuse. From the escape during the Revoluo Paulista to a life of debauchery and voyages in Europe and the Far East. The secondary characters are just as fascinating as Seraphim. Pinto Caludo --the hero's best friend and world-class scoundrel--tries to take over the protagonist position during a steamship cruise to Europe (and is immediately kicked out of the novel). This is a book where the 'viscerally surreal' metaphors carry you over to the moeurs and fashions of the 20s and 30s. Please don't expect a traditional narrative. The book is a sequence of glittering literary snippets. Just let yourself go and remember- never give back that copy. It's too precious!"},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy","review":"Most people know of only one book by Thackeray: his witty and savage masterpiece VANITY FAIR. PENDENNIS, perhaps his second-best book, is certainly no slouch itself: a funny, rollicking Bildungsroman, PENDENNIS chronicles the adventures of a loveable young man who almost always manages to get himself into trouble, and his tribulations with the several attractive women in his life (including his young mother). There are some definite slow patches to the work, but for the most part it moves almnost at a rip-roaring pace, and it has none of the overseriousness that mars Thackeray's later works (such as the fascinating, but slowpaced THE NEWCOMES). This is Victorian reading at its most pleasurable, if not its most intellectually challenging."},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy","review":"Although this **would** be a good edition of the novel, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BOOK CONTAINS ONLY VOLUME 2 (THE SECOND HALF OF THE NOVEL).

This novel does not really have a character worth caring about. The main fellow, young Pendenis, is shallow, vain, silly, self-important, mostly thanks to the two ridiculous women in his life, a neurotic, almost clinically obsessed mother and a sort of foster sister, so perfect, virginal,and unerring to be completely sickening and a total bore. But of course to the author, these women are &#34;perfection&#34; and sainted in every way. He really had the Victorian &#34;Angel in the House&#34; complex, this guy did. And he is such a snob. His views come in loud and clear over the narration of the story.I don't mind the story in itself but again, you really have to plough threw a lot of garbage to get to it."},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy","review":"Pendennis is a right-of-passage about a young man of limited means who fancies otherwise.

While it does mention certain situations (Korean War, intervention in the Middle East and Belgian Congo) over and over again, it doesn't really tell you much, certainly no more than any other book on the UN. In addition, these and other interventions that are mentioned are not chronologically presented, but rather are organized under such uninformative chapter titles as \\"The United Nations and the United States\\" and \\"The United Nations and Power Politics.\\" On the topic of power politics (versus internationalism), the author repeats very simplistic arguments (if they could be even termed such) that whenever internationalism is employed the result is good, and when power politics (i.e. military and, I suppose, economic strong-arming) is used the results are wanting. But the author includes such actions as the Persian Gulf War as an example of internationalism -- as well as JFK's backup plan for using the UN to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis -- as examples of internationalism, when the spirit of internationalism in such cases could readily be called into doubt in favor of an interpretation suggesting the UN is just a rubber-stamp, in those cases, for what would otherwise be \\"power politics.\\" Regardless, there are some decent, if brief, histories of UN interventions which are useful; but the organization makes them so difficult to place in a greater context that I would highly recommend reading another book. If you are more interested in the actual organization of the UN rather than so much history of its interventions, you can find a much better organized account (as well as some limited history) in \\"The United Nations at the Crossroads of Reform.\\""},{"Title":"Prima Donnas and Soubrettes of Light Opera and Musical Comedy In America","review":"I obtained this book temporarily from my library system because I needed to do some research on a particular late nineteenth-century singer named Jesse Bartlett Davis, the contralto who first introduced \\"Oh Promise Me\\" to the world.The book features chapters on about 20 different female light opera singers of the day (it was published in 1900) and sheds light on their then-current careers.The information that I obtained from this book on Jesse Barlett Davis was priceless and since the author interviewed her for the book, very immediate. After singing \\"Oh Promise Me\\" around 5,000 times in 3,000 performances of the musical \\"Robin Hood\\" (the numerical discrepancy was because the audience often demanded an encore of the then-wildly popular song), Ms. Davis relates that she tried to insert a different song into the wedding section.

Likewise if you look for Cooperative Game Theory, you wont find it here.

As such a background in game theory is an absolute necessity if one is to deal with problems in these areas. This book is an advanced treatment of game theory, and presupposes the reader already has had some exposure to the subject. There is an excellent set of exercises at the end of each chapter, and so the book can be used as a textbook or for self-study.After an elementary example of a game in the introduction to motivate the subject, the authors begin in Part I of the book with the subject of static games with complete information. Strategic-form games are defined, along with dominated strategies, and the important concept of Nash equilibrium, the latter being introduced to deal with games that are not solvable by iterated strict dominance. For those with a background in elementary functional analysis, the authors prove that finite strategic-form game has a mixed-strategy equilibrium and prove that the Nash-Equilibrium has a closed graph. The concept of Nash equilibrium is extended to the concept of a correlated equilibrium, wherein each player can send another a private signal before they choose their strategy.In Part II, the authors discuss dynamic games with complete information. Examples of these kinds of games include a sequential version of the battle of the sexes game, and a sequential version of matching pennies. The authors discuss subgame-perfect equilibria, wherein an n-tuple of strategies constitute Nash equilibria in every subgame. The Stackelberg model of duopoly is discussed along with the repeated Prisoner&quot;s dilemna, the latter being an example of backward induction in finitely repeated games. A kind of generalization of the principle of optimality in dynamic programming is used to analyze perfect public equilibria via a tool called self-generation.In Part III of the book, the authors discuss static games of incomplete information. Examples are discussed including Bayesian games, where at least one player is uncertain about another player&quot;s payoff function, and first-price and second-price auctions. In first-price auctions, each player submits a sealed bid and the one with the highest bid obtains the item; in second-price auctions each player submits a sealed bid but the player submitting the highest bid gets to purchase the item for a cost given by the player with the second highest bid. The authors explain in detail the dominant strategies for these types of auctions. Bargaining with two-sided incomplete information is discussed and the optimal amount of trade is found from the linear equilibrium of the Chatterjee-Samuelson double action.In Part IV, dynamic games of incomplete information are discussed by the authors. Examples that they discuss include signaling games such as the two-period reputation game, and Spence&quot;s education game. Signaling is widely used by firms and organizations in spite of it being somewhat costly to do so. For example a public company may be trying to convince investors that it represents high returns. The authors show how to obtain sequential perfect Bayes equilibrium in these and other scenarios. The authors also discuss reputation effects in games, with an example being the chain-store game. The general case of single long-run players with reputation effects is treated in detail. Bargaining with sequential buyers is also discussed with examples given for one-sided asymmetric information and mechanism design.The last part of the book discussed miscellaneous topics in game theory, including strategic stability, more discussion on signaling, finite strategic-form games, and supermodular games. The treatment is more complicated mathematically with emphasis on proving existence theorems for Nash equilibria and pure-strategy equilibria. The notion of a Markov perfect equilibrium is employed to discuss situations where the past has a direct influence on current opportunities. This brings in the fascinating subject of stochastic games, wherein current payoffs depend on the state of the game and on current actions, with the state evolving according to a Markov process. These are generalized to continuous time, leading to the famous differential games. Game theory under &quot;common knowledge&quot; is also discussed, with examples given of the &quot;dirty face&quot; games.Some omissions in the book, which would have of course increased the size of the book substantially, include mathematical modeling of poker and other card games. These are complicated games in which to analyze, but they have taken on considerable importance in the casino industry in recent years."},{"Title":"Game Theory","review":"If you are going to do Micro at more than an undergraduate level, you are going to have this book on your shelf.

The only caveat is that you'll want to make a color copy of the map, or have it laminated, since this was published in the form of a game module.

Annie Laurence owns &quot;Death on Demand&quot; bookshop, which is what every single one of Carolyn Hart's readers would do for a living if given the chance. There is one cat but she doesn't figure centrally. There's lots of good coffee. There's Annie's handsome, rich and adoring husband Max. There's an investigating officer so preposterously stupid it's astonishing he can walk around without an assistant reminding him to breathe every twenty seconds. There are about three references to the protagonist's (and, I suspect, author's) favourite mystery novels and writers per page. Although this is annoying, when the action gets slow you can amuse yourelf by counting them.

Or even temporary ones."},{"Title":"Honeymoon With Murder (A Death on Demand Mystery, Book 4)","review":"At long last Annie Laurance and Max Darling are married, in a ceremony which is a compromise between Max's mother Laurel's \\"far-out\\" ideas and Annie's desire for a simple, dignified ceremony. That all rings true, but what happens next does not. A murder is committed and a likely suspect disappears and suddenly the inhabitants of the island are enticed into a city of tents, divided up into men's and women's quarters from which they are to launch a search for a missing woman. It is difficult to imagine that such a thing would happen (why can't they search during the day and stay in their own homes at night?) and even more difficult to believe that a newly-married couple would fall for such a scheme. Max's mother Laurel provides some comic relief in the book, but her occult-loving friend Ophelia is a just a bit over the top. Let's come back down to earth, Mrs. Hart, and return to the formula which made you successful, the Agatha Christie-like mystery solved by the deductive reasoning of the heroine. Annie's solution to the case comes as almost a minor event compared to the other things which are going on in the book."},{"Title":"Honeymoon With Murder (A Death on Demand Mystery, Book 4)","review":"I normally love the Death on Demand series.

Before they can honeymoon, Annie's assistant Ingrid is abducted and a dead man is found in her house. The resulting search is so far fetched as to be a farce in many ways.This isn't one of Hart's best books. My primary peeve is that she forshadows the murderer early and often. Also, for a book with the word &quot;Honeymoon&quot; in the title, there's very little romance. I'm also getting really tired of the character of Posey. Annie deserves a more worthy adversary."},{"Title":"Honeymoon With Murder (A Death on Demand Mystery, Book 4)","review":"Carolyn Hart always seems to write such good mysteries, with the characters from this series.

Crane certainly takes us on a winding path to solve this murder. And as irritating as I find Annie, I thank god for her as well because, lord knows, the legal authorities certainly are hopeless!While I appreciated everyone's loyalty to Ingrid and enjoyed the quirky personalities in Hart's series, I didn't enjoy this particular story as much other than finally learning what Laurel had planned for the wedding day. I don't understand why it was necessary to set up a camp right there and make everyone sleep, eat, and search there. It's not that far from everyone's homes... I also want to know if Annie ever considers living her own life instead of through all these detectives? I do appreciate Hart's encyclopedic knowledge of the various detecting protagonists in the book world and, as much as I enjoy the listing of the various sleuths in fiction along with their various attributes, it gets rather irritating after awhile.The StoryIt may be Annie and Max's wedding, but it's definitely Laurel's day from the Hawaiian wedding breakfast followed by the boat race and on to the international luncheon followed by the international craft bazaar followed by the wedding and then the blooming reception. Which itself was followed by a frantic call at midnight by Ingrid screaming for help.When Annie and Max get to Ingrid's, they find a body but no Ingrid. And very quickly, the other cabin's inhabitants and Billy Cameron descend upon Ingrid's cabin getting in the way and demanding a search for Ingrid. A search that must get underway immediately if only to get around Posey's imminent arrival!When Posey latches on to the first possible suspect and refuses to consider any other possibilities, Henny takes over and organizes the search for Ingrid. Of course, Max, Annie, Laurel, and Henny have their own ideas of how to search, to discover the truth and it's off in all those directions for the crew. With, naturally, Annie knowing best.Now it seems that Betsy Raines is also missing. She arrived at her hotel in San Francisco, but hasn't been seen since and Alan is worried. Worried enough to ask Max to look into it.It certainly isn't being much of a honeymoon for Max and Annie. Sleeping in cots. Max in the Men's Side and Annie in the Women's. Not at all what they had planned.The CharactersIngrid Jones works for Annie Laurance at Death on Demand and manages Nightingale Courts (she lives in Cabin Three). Duane Webb lives in Cabin Four and secretly loves Ingrid. I suspect he doesn't do anything about it due to his own past tragedy, believing he doesn't deserve it. Ingrid loves him back. Secretly. Ophelia Baxter lives in Cabin Two and communes with the spirits. Mavis Beeson and her young son Kevin are hiding out from her abusive husband Henry in Cabin Six. She's also having it off with young Billy. Adele Prescott lives in Cabin Five and doesn't have anything nice to say about anyone. Jesse Penrick lived in Cabin One. He is not a nice man. Poking and prying into other people's business, loving to see them squirm. Now he'll pay the price for that. Tom Smith lives in Cabin Seven building miniatures which he sells at craft fairs and flea markets.Annie Laurance is about to become Annie Darling. Finally having succumbed to Max. Of course, it'll never hold her back from investigating crime! Max Darling is getting married at last! Laurel is his very free-thinking mother with a need to explore every culture in their wedding. Max's three sisters including Dierdre are bridesmaids. Barbie is Max's secretary at Confidential Commissions.Henny Brawley is a force to be reckoned with on the island and she quickly takes up the reins for the Ingrid's search calling on the members of her various organizations to help even as she pursues clues in the style of many of her favorite detecting characters. Madeline Kurtz is her second-in-command. Billy Cameron is the policeman in charge while Chief Saulter is on vacation. Circuit Solicitor Brice Willard Posey will take charge of the case...which means the truth will never emerge.Ben Parotti owns the ferry, the marine store, and the bar. Alan Nichols works for Betsy Raines at the Piping Plover Gallery and had been to the wedding. Dr. Samuels is a good customer at Death on Demand and protective of his patients. Lucinda Barrows is excited by her part in this particular play...little does she know how short-lived her part will be.The CoverThe cover is a somewhat cartoonish collage of an owl peering out at us from the head of a bed. One of the pillows stabbed by a sword and swirling with a vine of tubular flowers while the bed itself hosts a scattering of Tarot cards, wedding rings, and a pyramid.The title says it all when Annie finally learns what Max has planned for their honeymoon trip, truly a Honeymoon with Murder."},{"Title":"Honeymoon With Murder (A Death on Demand Mystery, Book 4)","review":"Loved this book - love ALL the Death on Demand books, but this one more than most.

I've found dozens of great mysteries I knew nothing about and try to mark and identify each reference to another author's work.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS.Qualifying LapsSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel"},{"Title":"Honeymoon With Murder (A Death on Demand Mystery, Book 4)","review":"Through each new offering in this series, Carolyn Hart's word-smithing skills have been reducing down into an increasingly potent balsamic brew, and this one has arrived at sheer literary sensation polished to a sheen of luxury literature. HONEYMOON WITH MURDER, # 4 in Hart's DEATH ON DEMAND series, opened on a chilling mood driving a fast pace, as befits the classic murder mystery genre. After a thorough reader capture had been achieved, the pace slowed and the style warmed into Annie and Max's wedding, precisely when I was ready for that contrast.Due to Circuit Solicitor Posey's bungling, posturing incompetence over-simplifying a complex murder scene, a citizen command camp was established, adding a high-aroma spice of farcical fun to the plot, with a huge, carnival-like collection of locals volunteering to join in finding Ingrid, Annie's employee at Death on Demand (her Broward's Rock bookstore). Where was Ingrid and why had she disappeared? That situation was tied to a murder, of course, which had occurred in Ingrid's cabin in Nightingale Courts.Within this menagerie of activity, the relationship between Annie and Max continued to spark with feisty warmth and subtle hot spots, and some of the characters with potential to go sour were surged in heroic appeal, including Laurel and Henny. To me it's particularly endearing that Hart gradually redeems characters with which Annie clashes (grandly expressing heated irritation).A few dark characters (Jesse Penrick and Duane Webb among them), some of whom were redeemed, others of whom were developed through-and-through with yummy bitters, enhanced the complexity of isolating the killer, with all points arranged within elaborate convolutions.The denouement disclosure scene featured Annie in her glory as it rolled out with stunningly riveting intensity. I read through the scene nonstop, comprehending and remembering all the salient details due to the sequential logic and mesmerizing clarity of Annie's presentation of the resolutions. This surprised me somewhat because often in past reads I've taken the closing details in a classic mystery in a few small doses, as I'm horrible with memory of facts and timetables. Sometimes I notice, to my chagrin, that I've read the \\"who done it\\" explanation and promptly forgotten who it was and why, as I read rapidly through the information. I rarely make much effort to stoke up my cerebrum to guess ahead of time who did what to whom. So why do I read mysteries? Do I have a clue?Returning to note the appeals of HONEYMOON (appeals I remember), the campsite setting warmed me into the story, along with the entertainment factor in the requisite division of \\"Men's\\" and \\"Women's\\" intimate needs areas, with the separated territories taking hold of Annie and Max and providing the perfect ironic foil to the \\"after the wedding\\" expectations of the couple and the reader. With those divisions remaining stable throughout the plot, the simplicity of the few paragraphs of the final scene in which the honeymoon was set to \\"begin\\" perfected an exquisite elegance of understatement.I'll conclude by giving my opinion that Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry series is not, as has often been claimed, Agatha Christie's modern day, USA, namesake counterpart to Miss.

HONEYMOON WITH MURDER, # 4 in Hart's DEATH ON DEMAND series, opened on a chilling mood driving a fast pace, as befits the classic murder mystery genre. After a thorough reader capture had been achieved, the pace slowed and the style warmed into Annie and Max's wedding, precisely when I was ready for that contrast.Due to Circuit Solicitor Posey's bungling, posturing incompetence over-simplifying a complex murder scene, a citizen command camp was established, adding a high-aroma spice of farcical fun to the plot, with a huge, carnival-like collection of locals volunteering to join in finding Ingrid, Annie's employee at Death on Demand (her Broward's Rock bookstore). Where was Ingrid and why had she disappeared? That situation was tied to a murder, of course, which had occurred in Ingrid's cabin in Nightingale Courts.Within this menagerie of activity, the relationship between Annie and Max continued to spark with feisty warmth and subtle hot spots, and some of the characters with potential to go sour were surged in heroic appeal, including Laurel and Henny. To me it's particularly endearing that Hart gradually redeems characters with which Annie clashes (grandly expressing heated irritation).A few dark characters (Jesse Penrick and Duane Webb among them), some of whom were redeemed, others of whom were developed through-and-through with yummy bitters, enhanced the complexity of isolating the killer, with all points arranged within elaborate convolutions.The denouement disclosure scene featured Annie in her glory as it rolled out with stunningly riveting intensity. I read through the scene nonstop, comprehending and remembering all the salient details due to the sequential logic and mesmerizing clarity of Annie's presentation of the resolutions. This surprised me somewhat, because often in past reads, I've taken the closing details in a classic mystery in a few small doses, as I'm horrible with memory of facts and timetables. Sometimes I notice, to my chagrin, that I've read the \\"who done it\\" explanation and promptly forgotten who it was and why, as I read rapidly through the information. I rarely make much effort to stoke up my cerebrum to guess ahead of time who did what to whom. So why do I read mysteries? Do I have a clue?Returning to note the appeals of HONEYMOON (appeals I remember), the campsite setting warmed me into the story, along with the entertainment factor in the requisite division of \\"Men's\\" and \\"Women's\\" intimate needs areas, with the separated territories taking hold of Annie and Max and providing the perfect ironic foil to the \\"after the wedding\\" expectations of the couple and the reader. With those divisions remaining stable throughout the plot, the simplicity of the few paragraphs of the final scene in which the honeymoon was set to \\"begin\\" perfected an exquisite elegance of understatement.I'll conclude by giving my opinion that Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry series is not, as has often been claimed, Agatha Christie's modern day, USA, namesake counterpart to Miss. Marple. Carolyn Hart's Death on Demand series is. Though this is meant as a compliment to Mrs. Hart, it is not meant as an insult to Churchill.Churchill's Jane Jeffry series has something I crave, which I hadn't found in a classic mystery series, not even in the best of the best.

Mostly Brujeria and Hoodoo spells involving spells such as. bothersome neighbor move away spell. To Control a Bothersome Neighbor. To discover the Identity of an Occult Enemy. Although the booklet, because it is not much of a book, \\"it only contains about 42 pages\\" it is a Simple Spellbook. Aimed for the beginners in mind. There are some Incantations. And I quote the book in one of its incantations.\\"For them that stealeth, or borroweth and returneth, not this book, from it's owner let the book change into a serpent in their hands, and sting him. Let book worms gnaw their entrails............... \\" And so on, and so on...This booklet it not very Wicca friendly, but for those young Hoodoo, and Brujos, it is a nice little spell book, for the brujos who have practiced for a long time, these spells should be known buy heart, and thus the book would not be very helpful, unless having it as a small little refrence or research book. Still, very simple, and safe, and I usually give a copy or recomend it for the young Brujos, who have some interest in simple spells.Spells included, Hexes, Curses, Protection, Court Case, Protection from Thieves, Stop Gossip, Avoid Accidents, Against Slander. The Booklet it 42 pages, and each page has a spell, charm or a Mojo bag = 42 spells. No history, theory, or authors experiences, just a simple Spell book. I do recommend it for those who are looking for their first Spell book, for more experienced practitioners. \\"Been there, done that, save your money.."},{"Title":"Protection; Spells and Charms","review":"I loved it! the service was speedy!

Chocked full of primary resources, creeds, statements and theology (with the sad omission of Seventh Day Baptists for unknown reasons), this is reference material for any library needing Baptist theological evolution over the past several hundreds of years. Some of the early creeds included (dozens of pages worth) are worth the price of the book. Track Baptist spirituality from adventerous and fervent Biblical passion for God to safe, dry and bland (in some cases) 20th Century efforts at man's theology. But buy the book for the early statements of theology...you will have a goldmine."},{"Title":"Baptist Confessions of Faith, 1st Edition","review":"What should be the most important thing in choosing a church? Does the church profess the Bible is the word of God inerrant; that Jesus Christ is God, Lord and Savior? What is believed by the Pastor, what is believed by the members of the church and what is taught inside the church building? I certainly would not join a church that denied the contents of the Bible. Before joining a local congregation I would want to know what is taught at that particular congregation of believers. A confession of Faith is a profession of beliefs to what is true; a declaration of the understanding of the Bible and the truth of its contents. This book is an ambitious work in containing volumes of confessions and giving a very brief reason why a local church or group of churches came together to declare what the Bible taught.Working hypothesis of this book is the Baptist denomination has roots in England and the English Reformation: Starting with Wycliffe in the 15th century and William Tyndale translating the Bible into the vulgar English language. In the 1538 King Henry VIII was obliged to license Bibles into the English language. Calvinism and Anabaptism were imported to England about the same time. The Anabaptist taught that only the converted, who confessed Jesus as Savior and Baptized were believers and members of the Body of Christ. Puritans were Calvinist who wanted to purify the Church of England of Bad Doctrine. They consider good doctrine what is Calvinistic. Puritans wanted to change the Church from within. English Separatism wanted to separate form the English church and for the most part adopted the belief in believer's baptism. The English Separatist was Calvinist. This was the start from what we know today as the Baptist church.Forerunner Confessions, Anabaptist Confession of Faith are so called in this book and consume the first 78 pages of this work. By 1562 there were thirty-thousand Anabaptist who came from the Netherlands in England. Their beliefs and expression had to be hidden for fear of the death penalty awaited those holding Anabaptist beliefs during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In 1580 Robert Browne, in a county with Dutch Artisans, worked in the establishing congregationalism. Browne later fled to the Netherlands and still later rejoined the government church. In 1609 John Smyth baptized himself and others who joined that particular Separatist movement. Later he sought to join a longer established Mennonite congregation. A short confession of 1610 was written by John Smyth's group as a statement of Faith as consideration for the Mennonite church. The idea of the local congregational authority in choosing church leaders including the Pastor was originally an Anabaptist concept. These are the three points the author uses to argue a connection between Baptist and Anabaptist.This book contains five Anabaptist confessions plus two other statements about church organization. The Anabaptist argued for obedience to the government, but none of its members were to be part of the government. The argument that government and the sword is an instrument of God, but believers were not to use the sword and such could not be part of the Government. The confessions have strong statements against any member of Christ's body taking any sort of oath. There is also a call for shunning of those members who are excommunicated from their congregation. A group led by Thomas Helys made their own confession and separated from the fellowship of John Smyth with these theological questions. English Separatist and Baptist did not argue as such. The Anabaptist was not Calvinistic such as the early Baptist was. This is also easily recognized in comparing the different confessions.A large segment of this book deals with confessions of Particular Baptist who were Calvinistic and General Baptist who some of their confessions were more Arminian. Some of the Particular Baptist was in response to Quaker Evangelism. There was a thought going around that Particular Baptist was being converted to Quakerism. So part of the confessions deals with subjects of emotionalism and inner light. That it is through the Holy Spirit man understands the Bible and God's Truth. General Baptist confessions were in response to the Anglican Church and inner politics of London at the time. This book also includes confessions of the American Baptist and other countries outside England. This book presents the History around the confessions, but does not go in depth about the doctrine in the confessions."},{"Title":"Baptist Confessions of Faith, 1st Edition","review":"Lumpkin has created a great work, bringing together all the confessions of faith of the Baptist Church and others who have historically had an influence on the church. A must for serious church historians and for those who seek to follow the progression of the confessions from the beginning. Quality production and binding."},{"Title":"Baptist Confessions of Faith, 1st Edition","review":"The book written by William L. Lumpkin is the best available sourcebook for Baptist Confessions of Faith. The author collected the most famous Anabaptist and Baptist Confessions. It includes also English, American Baptist and some other Baptist Confessions from Europe and other countries. The book does not include Baptist Faith and Message 2000 because this book was revised only in 1969.

Still he showered them with love and ultimately brought them into his sports agency. Micki became a partner with her siblings and publicist at The Hot Zone, an offshoot of Yank's agency.Unlike her girly girl sisters, Micki is a tomboy who thinks nothing of entering the locker rooms of professional sports teams. However, she decides to change her appearance from one of the boys to a HOT NUMBER. Though New York Renegade Rick Carter thinks he is the one she wants to impress since he took a drunken kiss from her, Micki leans towards his teammate renowned playboy Damian Fuller. As she succeeds in catching Damien's full attention, she panics, afraid of rejection and defeat, unlike the baseball star who will lose plenty of games during his career. Damien tries to prove he is her only one, but a paternity suit apparently strikes him out.The second Hot Zone sports romance (see HOT STUFF) is a fun tale that the audience will adore as Micki the tomboy becomes a HOT NUMBER that her clients want in their bed. The story line is often amusing while providing insight into the drudgery of professional sports from an athlete's perspective. The support cast, especially her siblings and uncle and Damien's teammates add depth to a well written contemporary tale that will leave fans waiting for the final game starring middle sister Sophie.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hot Number (Hot Zone, Book 2)","review":"Great combination of love, sports, family, and fun sexy romance.

Now, all she needs is a man, and Damian Fuller, one of her uncle Yank's clients and a pro ball player, might fit the bill. The attraction seems to be mutual, with a bump or two in the road, as par the course of romance. However, Damian has a past that could well catch up with him, as Micki is not the only woman who thinks he'd make a good partner in forever.*** Damian seems to be an almost perfect hero, for the most part in this witty romance.

Taking the advice of her friend Roper, and help from Sophie her sister, Micki, plans on making over herself into one \\"hot number\\" and hopefully knocking the socks off of Diamian in the process. What starts off as a good idea looks like it's going to fail until one too many iced teas' of the Long Island variety sets in motion a chain of events that will bring Damian right into her personal world. Will she have what it takes to hold on to this baseball bad boy, or will she play the part of \\"just a friend?\\"Damian is a pro ball player. His focus is work and only work.

Oh and he can't forget the first kiss they shared. Talk about HOT!!! Now he is facing the fact that he needs to think of life after baseball and the one woman that he wants to have might just walk away from him. Or at the very least not allow herself to believe that the sports playboy has actually fallen for her.

Each have their own insecurities that have shaped the people that they've become. They are able to find the good in the other and complement each other.

I am a BIG fan of trilogies and this is a fun set. Am anxiously awaiting the next one even though I will be sad to see it all end."},{"Title":"Hot Number (Hot Zone, Book 2)","review":"Ok So I will skip the summary of the book being that so many other reviewers had that part covered. So I will get straight to my review.This book was hard for me to get through for the simple fact that the characters were just not realistic, the scenarios were annoyingly clich&eacute; and every single part of the book was completely predictable.Micki, the main character:1) Was portrayed as being reserved and timid. She was meant to be a tomboy, guys guy who never wore skirts or makeup because she was self concious, yet she gets a (physical) makeover and is overly confident in her sexuality and outwardly seducts a multimillionairre hot shot major league baseball player, who also just happens to be the man that intimidated her for a month. I mean, this is a girl who had to get drunk to kiss this guy in the begining of the book. I could see how that scenario was supposed to work, but it ended up being stupid. I rolled my eyes numerous times.2) ANNOYING. This part I blame on Ms. Phillips because she didn't spin how Micki rejected Damian very well. You reject a man who, you believe, will leave you because you are afraid that he will revert to his playboy ways after a pregnancy scandal. Yet he pours his heart out to you AFTER the scandal and you push him away anyway. And then you cry yourself a river because you miss him? Seriously?3) Contradictive.Damian was a sissy (just without the si, instead a pu). I cant even get into how horribly Damians character was because he was all over the place. Phillips meant to make him a macho man, but instead she turned him into a girly emotional idiot.This whole Yank and Lola thing was so fake it made my teeth hurt. The sisters were bland and underdeveloped. Carter was supposed to be the bad boy, jerk but ended up falling in love with a girl who was spreading eagle for the entire major league (I'm sure she got some of the minors in there too.) And Carole... I think Phillips meant for us to sympathize with her and understand where she was coming from for doing the dumb things she did. But all she kept doing was going back and saying 'I don't want to be on welfare' and 'my life was so hard on welfare', so she goes after the staring center fielder and claims he's the father of her illegitimate child, when the real father is, guess what? A major league baseball player who is heads over heels in love with her two seconds away from take over the soon to be retired star of the team, which would mean that he makes good money, at least enough to pay the rent and put food on teh table. I could understand if she was just really really stupid but Carole was a legal secretary. Or if she was just a gold digger, but she wasnt. She just didnt want to be on welfare! Oh, and note to Ms Carly, being on welfare is not a valid reason to make a character emotionally scarred.I gave this book a two star rating because the sex scenes were pretty okay, not great but ok. I am not a grouch and I love romance novels. I just hate ridiculous predictability in a book, and characters that don't make sense.I am upset that I actually read the entire book. I bought two more books from this same author when I bought this one. I got them because this author had good reviews on Amazon, but I was let down. Hopefully they are not as painful as this one.P.S. Oh yeah... and whats with all the crying??? I wish Phillips would have created a character that entered the scene whenever a person started crying just to kung fu karate chop them and tell them to shut the H-E-Double Hockey Sticks UP! I'm a girl, my nickname was crybaby when I was a kid and I wanted to hit someone every tiem a character started crying. I mean enough already!"},{"Title":"Hot Number (Hot Zone, Book 2)","review":"Micki Jordan is the baby of the Jordan family. A publicist to sports stars, she works in the family firm \\"The Hot Zone\\". Although she has always been more of tomboy, she's getting tired of always being seen as \\"one of the guys\\". Especially by Damian Fuller, the handsome major league ball player that she has been fantasizing about for a while. So her sister Sophie gives her a make over and \\"girl\\" lessons.Damian has been attracted to Micki for awhile, even before her make over, but now it's getting harder and harder for him to deny the attraction between them. Even worse, Micki is not the sort of woman he normally goes out with. He knows that she's not the love \`em and leave \`em type. But no matter how much he tells himself to stay away from her, he can't seem to stop himself. When a jealous team mate of Damian's sets them up for a media scandal, Micki and Damian find themselves hiding out together away from the public eye. Before long the sexual tension between them overcomes all of Damian's good intentions and they fall into an affair. But when they return to the real world Damian is faced with the shocking information that an ex-fling is claiming that Damian is the father of her child. He needs Micki's skills as a publicist and her support as a friend. But once the crisis is over, can Damian convince Miki that he wants her in his life permanently?Hot Number is the second book of what appears to be three books featuring the Jordan sisters. I had read the first book, Hot Stuff, about Annabelle Jordan and truly enjoyed it. When Micki's story became available, I grabbed it and devoured it in one sitting. Damian is a wonderful hero, dealing with the end of his career and yet not quite ready to let go. Micki is dealing with her own insecurities.

Learning who the real Damian is, as he was trying to figure it out for himself, and having Uncle Yank push each of them a little along the way was just so enjoyable. I love how he's declared himself the matchmaker for the girls! Micki was beyond lovable. Who can't relate to her self-esteem issues, and to see her fumble along the way a little bit before she found her guy. It was a nice progression and a believable one to see the path she took. She didn't completely leave her tomboy self in the past which I really liked, but just through trying new things she turned into a person she was happy being. But the nicest part was Damian was already falling for her long before she started experimenting with being more girly.It was just a really well rounded story. A great relationship, a resolution to Yank and Lola, a side story with Carole and Carter - I wasn't really invested in this except for Damian's direct POV on it, and it seemed like Carter made a pretty fast 180 between the character we were introduced to, to the character he ended up trying to be, but it was a small detail and Micki and Damian overshadowed them, rightfully so!

But I am grateful for his compiling this list of the good guys in the struggle to attain the freedom which we all say we want, and are too often willing to sacrifice by pieces to other ends. The book would benefit greatly from better editorial attention to correct obvious syntactical errors and repetitions. Overall, an admirable addition to the literature of classical liberalism."},{"Title":"The Triumph of Liberty: A 2,000 Year History Told Through the Lives of Freedom's Greatest Champions","review":"In this book Jim Powell attempts to tell us the story of liberty by illuminating the lives of it's greatest champions.Mr. Powell is a great storyteller and for the most part he succeeds in his mission of telling us the story of freedom's champions from Cicero to Ronald Reagan.The book might have been better if Powell had started out by giving us a definition of liberty. In the biblical sense liberty implies the ability to be morally self-governed.This was certainly how Locke, Jefferson and Franklin among other libertarians understood the term.If the concept of self-government is understood as it relates to liberty the author would have to eliminate the chapters on H.L. Mencken,and Albert Jay Nock among others.I agree with a previous reviewer that the book's inclusion of Martin Luther King Jr. is highly questionable.Dr. King was certainly a great man who achieved great things.But He was not a libertarian, He was a socialist.But beyond these criticisms this is an excellent book.My favorite chapter is the one about William E. Gladstone. Mr. Gladstone's life was the personification of liberty.Like John Locke and Hugo Grotius Gladstone was a devout christian who practiced moral self-government in his personal life and attempted to impose that same sense of self-discipline upon government. Once again this is a great book, which ought to be required reading in all of our schools.

The inspiration is from the raw courage, conviction, and strength of these people; the warning is that many paid a heavy price and that the struggle for freedom is renewed with every generation. You don't have to be a libertarian or Republican to enjoy this; the context of these struggles is not always strictly poltical per se, but nearly all these men and women had allegiance to, and drew strength from, a higher ideal then man. Raoul Wallenberg's story alone is worth the price."},{"Title":"The Triumph of Liberty: A 2,000 Year History Told Through the Lives of Freedom's Greatest Champions","review":"I am so tired of being told what we have done wrong. Here, finally, a historian gives us a narrative of human triumph. After all, we know very well that as a group and as individuals we often behave badly, make mistakes, and choose to pursue grubby, greedy goals. But not always. How refreshing it is to find an historian willing to celebrate individuals who have devoted their lives to pursuing noble ambitions. I liked it for the same reasons that I liked Diana Muir's recent Bullough's Pond with its unabashed celebration of the entreprenurial spirit. I won't quibble with the triumphalist tone, this book is frank about its goals and they are what make reading it fun. I will complain only that the sketches are a bit, well, sketchy. I would have found longer, more thoughtful portraits even more compelling, even if they had given us to understand that even these exemplary men and women were complex, had difficulties and sometimes got it wrong. What is important is that this book holds up for our admiration a group of people who devoted their lives to making our world better."},{"Title":"The Triumph of Liberty: A 2,000 Year History Told Through the Lives of Freedom's Greatest Champions","review":"The subject matter here simply can't be beat.

What more can be said?"},{"Title":"The Triumph of Liberty: A 2,000 Year History Told Through the Lives of Freedom's Greatest Champions","review":"With this book, Jim Powell advances the notion that modern history can best be viewed as a quest for freedom, and even the most cynical among us must agree that \\"wresting liberty from tyranny's iron fist\\" is indeed worth fighting for. In a series of short biographical vignettes, Powell looks at the lives of sixty-five historical figures that he deems heroes in this struggle, making for a fascinating and inspiring read. However, any such grouping of people is bound to spark debate, as very few of these individuals would call themselves \\"libertarian\\", nor would all libertarians be quick to claim them all as ancestors or heirs.Historian Paul Johnson may sum up this book best with these words from its foreword: \\"I do not agree with all of it\\". That luminaries like Cicero and Thomas Paine belong in this canon is almost without question, but the case for Beethoven, Goya, and Robert Heinlein (among others) requires one to adopt the modern \\"big L\\" libertarian perspective in its entirety. I, for one, would prefer to see Margaret Thatcher's place in the book removed, and replaced by a section on Nelson Mandela; economic issues aside, surely most people would place the latter above the former as a champion of liberty and justice in our time.Thus, the greatest weakness of this book is also its strength: it forces the reader to think, to consider what \\"liberty\\" really means. Given the state of the world today, that fact alone merits my recommendation."},{"Title":"King Leonard's Celebration (Kidderminster Kingdom Tales)","review":"This a great story based on the parable of the wedding feast from the bible.

It was obvious to my students that the author was not advocating that life is one big ice-cream party. Instead, it gave my students insight into God's character.

He does not leave his castle, but watches his subjects carefully through a powerful spyglass. He is a very kind ruler, often sending anonymous gifts to them. Because, his subjects have never seen him, they don't believe that he exists.One day, King Leonard decides to throw a magnificent party with lots of ice cream. He sends his royal messengers out into the kingdom with invitations to the party. All of them decline the invitation for various reasons. Not to be dissuaded, the Leonard expands the invitations to the poor people outside his kingdom. They were flattered to be invited, so they all come and enjoy the balloons and ice cream they share with Leonard. The party went so well that Leonard invited them to stay in his house forever, and of course they did. All lived happily ever after with their lives being a continuous party of cake and ice cream.While the point of the story, namely that you should appreciate your benefactors, is a good one, the ending turned me off. Children should not be taught that life is a continuous party with cake and ice cream provided by a benevolent king. They need to learn that life requires them to contribute to society and that there is no \\"sugar daddy\\" that will provide them with treats for the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Tapestry (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Tapestry is the third book that Belva Plain wrote with the same main characters.

Underestimated by those looking for details on New Zealand or the theatrical world. Those who love good, traditional English mystery plots will love this one."},{"Title":"A Wreath for Rivera","review":"Lord Pastern and Bagott is England's most eccentric nobleman, egotistical, publicity hungry, and given to sudden and bizarre enthusiasms that tend to land him on the front page. His latest enthusiasm is to become a drummer with jazz band, and much to the horror of his long-suffering wife he manages to use his title to buy his way into one. In the process, however, his step-daughter Felicite falls for ultra-oily band member Carlos Rivera--and when Lord Pastern and Bagott and Carlos Rivera take to the stage the result is pure murder. Fortunately for all concerned, Inspector Alleyn happens to be in the audience at the time.Ngaio Marsh is among the great masters of the British mystery novel, and her particular claim to fame is not so much in her plots as in her remarkable gift at creating character and setting. In WREATH FOR RIVERA she displays her ability to the full, peopling her novel with a host of memorable individuals and rushing the reader from the Pastern and Bagott household to a London night spot and back again. In this instance certain aspects of her plot are transparent, but she also handles the mystery quite well, and it will be the rare reader who spots the killer before Inspector Alleyn tells all.Although WREATH FOR RIVERA is expertly written and in terms of plot may well be among Marsh's best efforts, I must admit that it is not among my favorites; like COLOUR SCHEME, which was written about the same time, the characters tend to emerge as extremely abrasive--cousins Carlisle and Edward are the exception--and in consequence it is less appealing than most of her other titles. Recommended nonetheless.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Wreath for Rivera","review":"No one would be expected to shed any tear when piano-accordionist Carlos Rivera was killed during a performance.

To all appearances, Carlos was killed by a make-shift dart fired from a gun held by Lord George Pastern as part of the performance, minus the dart of course.Inspector Alleyn happened to be among the spectators and of course, he was asked to take the lead in the investigation. It would be a tricky investigation. Lord Pastern was known to be eccentric and showy, changing hobbies like seasonal fashion. His wife had been determined to break off her daughter's facsination with Carlos, and Lady Pastern had roped in two relatives, Carlisle Wayne and Edward Manx, to support her.Ngaio Marsh painted an almost comical family of misfits with the Pasterns and relatives. In all appearances, their interrelationship were critical to the solution of the mystery. However, this was where Marsh could not measure up to the other great mystery writers such as Sayers and Christie.Her investigators went painstakingly over the details several times. However, experienced mystery readers would quickly be able to identify non-relevant details, which for some reason Marsh repeated in more than one chapter.Her analysis were also not as brilliant.

She is a master in her genre. In this book we see a little bit of a digression for her. Most of her books take place on the stage with actors and actreses as the protagonists. This one is on the stage, but it's with a swing band this time, not a play. Alleyn and Fox are trying to solve what does appear to be a very \\"fancy\\" murder as Fox puts it. A musician who plays an accordian dies on stage at the end of one of the band's numbers. When Fox and Alleyn start investgating they find that this Rivera is a very unsavoury character, and there could be lots of suspects. Most of the suspects they follow are from one family, and what a family it is! Talk about eccentrics! Fox and Alleyn get through all the window-dressing and unmask the real murder. Good stuff here."},{"Title":"A Wreath for Rivera","review":"I've never cared for Ngaio Marsh's Inspector Roderick Alleyn as a character. He seems stuffy and annoyingly patronizing to his loyal assistant Fox. However, the Inspector Alleyn books are consistently good detective stories.\\"A Wreath for Rivera\\" (APA \\"Swing, Brother, Swing\\") has a nice plot with interesting, if somewhat cardboard, characters. The primary plot gimmick is very good -- so good that I remember it later being used in 3 TV series: \\"Burke's Law\\", \\"Blacke's Magic\\", & \\"Monk\\". I wish I had read \\"A Wreath for Rivera\\" before I had been exposed to this trick; I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more.I don't object to slow-paced stories, but this one has too many similar scenes.

He is convinced that he could make this a full time occupation, regardless of the fact that he has no talent whatsoever and is being used as a money man by the band. His stepdaughter becomes infatuated with Carlos, an oily,social climbing smarmer who is the band's piano accordionist who is using her for his own ends. When Carlos is killed by a metal projectile, supposedly fired from Lord Pastern's revolver, Inspector Alleyn investigates the crime and uncovers a hornet's nest of drug dealing (very exotic in 1949 when this book was written), blackmail and other shady dealings. The book is very well written but somehow terribly old fashioned in a style earlier than the 40's eg. would anyone in the 40's refer to a mirror as a looking glass? I found it to be an ok read, but not really gripping."},{"Title":"A Wreath for Rivera","review":"As usual, I enjoyed another excellent mystery from the pen of Dame Marsh. I particularly liked the fact that Detective-Inspector Fox was given more stage-time. However, while I find the motive for the murder perfectly plausible, I'm not so sure I believe in the efficacy of the method. The plot is similar to _Enter a Murderer_, in that what is supposed to be a joke or &quot;staged&quot; murder, turns out to be the real thing, in front of a dozen witnesses. Still, even though this set-up is similar, Marsh populates the novel with an altogether different cast of people. The only thing I wish is that when the book ended, it would give the reader a clue as to what happens to the various characters, and not just reveal who the murderer is."},{"Title":"A Wreath for Rivera","review":"Dame Ngaio Marsh certainly ranks among the writers of the Classic British Detective story, whose other practitioners include the likes of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Margery Allingham and P.D. James, all of whom are represented by first rate television versions. This book is one of Marsh's better efforts in a long career. As such it is a safe bet to entertain any fan of the genre.In a gambit she used on occasion, not only is her protagonist, Inspector Alleyn, on the spot when the murder occurs, but, so too, is his wife. Surprisingly, aside from being mentioned as being there with her husband, she is given only a few lines in the novel, simply to register her presence and, presumably, to keep alive her role vis-a-vis the Inspector.The mystery is a complex one, involving a highly eccentric Lord of the Realm and his family, as well as a popular music band he has adopted as his way of becoming a \\"hot percussionist\\", only the latest of his short-lived infatuations. With this cast of characters to work with, Marsh weaves patterns of interaction allowing for love, hate, condescension, status envy, and the other niceties that give a mystery its necessary feints and diversions as the detectives seek to find out Who Done it and How it was Done. For me, the most pleasing and appealing of the characters in play is the obviously innocent cousin whose love for another of the role-players seems to be requited only to ......Well, you know how young love goes.The quite bearable weakness of the book is the handling of the conclusion which doesn't quite satisfy through overuse in the genre of the period but, happily, is not obvious until the very end.Certainly, Ngaio Marsh fans will want to read this; so, too, will the detective story devotee. Other readers should find this an interesting exercise in this highly popular genre. The date of publication, shortly afterWorld War 2, should not imply to any reader that the book is dated. It is, as the saying goes, as good as new."},{"Title":"A Wreath for Rivera","review":"Ngaio Marsh is definitely an overlooked mystery writer.

It addresses two questions that are fundamental to the workings of local representative democracy: whom or what is it that the councillor elected on a party platform represents, and are those councillors elected to govern a local authority area or to serve and respond to the opinions of their electors. The book examines the impact that political party outside the council chamber and the party groups within it have on the very nature of local representation, on the way in which citizens are able to participate in local politics and on the conduct of council business and political decision-making.The book begins by analysing democratic theory and its relevance to local politics, before considering the role, organisation and activities of political parties in local government, both inside and outside the council chamber. It looks at the dynamics of council chamber politics and how these are influenced by the party system. It considers the approaches taken by the three main parties towards the conduct of local political activity and the way in which parties, and their members, interpret and experience local politics, representation and democracy. The book provides evidence to show that political parties have come to dominate the local political landscape to the almost total exclusion of citizens wishing to become involved in local politics outside the framework of a national party. Political parties serve to delegitimise any political activity not conducted within the very strict definition of local politics constructed and shared by the three main parties. Finally, the book sets out the changes necessary for political parties to make if they are to become meaningful and relevant to the citizens they claim to represent and if local politics is to no longer be the domain of the leviathan that is the political party.The main theme of the book is how those involved in party politics [in the UK] interpret politics, democracy and representation and how they equate representation with governing locally and more importantly with governing through and by the political party. The focus of the book is deliberately on the three main UK-wide political parties, as it is they that have responsibility for shaping and dominating the local political landscape. Indeed, it is the organisation, structure, activities and approach of the three main parties that has resulted in the homogenisation of the conduct of local politics. Smaller parties such as the Greens, the British National Party and the small array of local organisations that have secured election to council chambers, are far from having anything like a significant impact on the dominant practices of local politics shaped by the three main parties. Moreover, the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru are well-established elements of their own nations four party systems and conduct local politics and the politics of the council chamber in broadly similar ways to the three UK-wide parties. Thus, the Conservative and Labour parties and the Liberal Democrats face little challenge when it comes to the conduct of local politics, cast, as it is, in their own images. As a consequence the three main parties are the main, though not exclusive focus of the book."},{"Title":"The Gourman Report: A Rating of Undergaduate Programs in American and International Universities","review":"The idea of a guide that ranks undergraduate programs by area of study seems compelling at first. However, Jack Gourman's book falls far short. He fails to provide an explanation of rationale and methodology. Perhaps the greatest disservice Gourman does to the reader is a very strong bias in favor of big state schools. Smaller (but very distinguished) liberal arts schools almost never make a showing, even in programs where they have an established reputation. Schools like Williams College, Swarthmore College, Wesleyan University, Amherst College, and the College of William and Mary, all of which emphasize teaching over faculty research, have astonishingly poor ratings in Gourman's rating of overall academic quality, while some mediocre public schools, such as the University of Missouri campus in my hometown of St. Louis, get a thumbs-up."},{"Title":"The Gourman Report: A Rating of Undergaduate Programs in American and International Universities","review":"The Gourman report is a very good source for the evaluation of undergraduate programs across the country.

When he ranks the top 100 schools, he gives Harvard and Princeton the number 1 and 2, at number 3 he lists the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor. Swarthmore College weighs in at 97. A lot of people would disagree with this ranking, but Gourman makes a point I agree with. Gourman argues that the larger state schools (especially schools that draw from all over the country and not just their home state such as Michigan, Wisconsin, California-Berkeley, and Virginia) are the best schools to receive a degree from. I agree with him because the strength of programs he evauluates are obviously better at the larger schools than such schools as Williams, Swarthmore and Amherst. While you may disagree with his rankings, it is hard to argue with the depth of support and statistics he deals with. It is also impossible to argue with his ranking of the U of M.

As we are led room by room through Japanese buildings of his time, we acquire an appreciation for the highly imaginitive individual expressions made by artisans of many crafts working within the standardization that gave the style longevity through many generations.His study ranges from the historical origins of Japanese architecture to covering room floorplans, as has become a staple in introducing Japanese tatami mat rooms since he first wrote this book in the 1886, to lavishing minute attention to the details of various crafts that made the Japanese interior design accessories touchstones of excellence throughout the world. He also provides intimate vignettes of individual design principles, items, materials, and construction utilized throughout Japanese houses, rooms, and tea rooms.His ability to translate the often fleeting impression of a space into precise identifiable elements makes him a valuable guide to this deceptively simple-looking style of interior design whose rigorous structure and aesthetic guidelines make it one of the great design styles of history. The extensive etchings included in the book provide concise, delightful, and sometimes humorous examples of the principles applied.Because he covers the essential architectural and design elements thoroughly without becoming bogged down in mundane enumeration of tiny variances, the lively text gives the reader a very good sense of how spaces within a Japanese home are a sum of more than their constituent parts and how principles are applicable across the many disciplines that comprise the Japanese style. That he did it so sympathetically in a timeframe in which nationalistic chauvinism so predominated the world landscape makes it all the more impressive.As an introductory volume to what makes traditional Japanese architectural design so delightful, this book is hard to beat. It's depth of understanding and comprehensive coverage of the style also make it an excellent reference volume for the more advanced student of Japanese design. That it is a standard item in bibliographies to Japanese design and on &quot;must read&quot; lists for Japanese design is no surprise."},{"Title":"Japanese homes and their surroundings,","review":"This is a great book which describes in fine detail theJapanese home in the late 1800s. This book captures a period of timewhen the Japanese house still had its unique cultural style and hadn't been excessively influenced by american or european style architecture. The book is clearly written and there are many detailed drawings which illustrate the text's descriptions. It is an interesting book both for its architectural detail as well as for its historical perspective."},{"Title":"Japanese homes and their surroundings,","review":"I purchased this book simply to get a quick overview of Japanese domestic architecture. The price is always right with Dover books so I just ordered it without any research. What a pleasant surprise to find myself reading a definitive work on the subject a few days later. The text is thoughtfully written and the illustrations skillfully done. As with any well written and illustrated book, color pictures are not overly missed. As a result of this book I find myself much more interested in Japanese architecture than I ever intended to be and heartily recommend it to anyone with an interest in home or interior design."},{"Title":"Japanese homes and their surroundings,","review":"I picked up the Dover paperback edition at a library book sale and was charmed by the author's detailed drawings as much as the description of domestic life in 19th century Japan. Morse originally published this in 1885, barely 30 years after Perry's expedition, and traveled around Japan documenting as many houses and styles as possible (including those of the Aino culture). There are no photographs, but the intricate line drawings and intimate descriptions of functional households -- kitchens and cooking utensils, washing areas, sleeping quarters -- are minutely detailed and thoroughly described in the text. Not just a book for those interested in architecture but history as well."},{"Title":"Japanese homes and their surroundings,","review":"I bought this book about 3 years ago from Amazon. So you'd think that it would be old hat by now. Yet I find myself picking it up at least once every few months to either refer to it for a construction detail or just to look for something new. What a wonderful resource for traditional Japanese design this book is.Trained as a Zoologist, Morse put his scientific powers of observation and systematic description to work during the 1880's in producing the sketches and text that describes a world of everyday Japanese design right before it was swamped with Western influence and largely disappeared. There are plenty of books that can show you pictures of ancient Japanese temples and teahouses, but what about the method of constructing the roof of an ordinary 19th century Tokyo home? This was stuff that few people thought was worth recording for posterity. Which is why Morse's book is so unique and valuable to us.Anyone with more than a passing interest in the way that things are built or designed would do well to put this book on their shelf. Interior decorators, architects, DIY types (such as myself), finish carpenters, contractors and furniture makers should all have a tattered, dog-eared copy of 'Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings' within easy reach. It is a constant source of inspiration."},{"Title":"Japanese homes and their surroundings,","review":"\\"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings\\" is a great book. If you've any interest in traditional Japanese architecture, get this book. Edward Morse was an American who went to Japan in 1877 to study brachiopods. He ended up recording a vanishing way of life instead. He tells you how Japanese homes were built and why they were built that way. Not much escapes his eye. In serviceable prose and clear drawings, he tells us about carpenters and their tools, houses, furnishings, privies, fences and gateways, water supplies and gardens. Most of it he compares favorably to American and European counterparts.Best of all, it's a Dover book and cheap."},{"Title":"Japanese homes and their surroundings,","review":"Several years ago I bought a reprint of Dr. Morse book and it has become not only a treasured Clasic but a Bible of information.

This book was written in the 1880's as essentially a travel study of what was quite exotic at the time. As such much effort was spent to explain many items, as well as being as wello as giving a good effort toward explaining some of the basic ideas which resulted in a design or facets of architectural design.In particularly when basised on cultural lifestyle.This book will also aid in determining the meaning of a variety of term left unexplained in other books.

There is no work in economics that evinces better judgment on the main issues or that does a better job of balancing theory with a sense for the facts. Knight begins by defending theoretical (that is, deductive) economics. Unlike the economic rationalists, however, Knight does not believe that theoretical economics can lead to precise results. The application of the &quot;analytic method&quot; must always be &quot;incomplete,&quot; he argues. Theoretical economics thus can only deal with &quot;tendencies,&quot; that is, &quot;with what 'would' happen under simplified conditions never realized, but always more or less closely approached in practice.&quot; This methodology Knight describes as &quot;the method of successive approximations.&quot; Knight also warns of the dangers of rationalism and the necessity of constantly checking one's results against the facts. &quot;When the number of factors taken into account in deduction becomes large, the process rapidly becomes unmanageable and errors creep in... It is better to stop dealing with elements separately before they get too numerous and deal with the final stages of the approximation by applying corrections empirically determined.&quot;Armed with the method, Knight proceeds to tackle several important problems in economics, especially dealing with the theoretical construct of &quot;perfect competition.&quot; By always keeping his head firmly within the empirically real, Knight is able to bring a great deal of sound judgment to a number of issues. Knight had a keen sense of human nature and how human beings behave in the real world of fact. He knew that most economists had made men out to be far more rational than they really were. Businesses, he argued, did not merely seek to meet the needs of the consumers; no, they sought to create new needs through innovation, advertising, and even a sort of manipulative hypnotism. In this, Knight argued, we find both progress and abuse, civilization and fraud. Knight also brings a good deal of sense to the problem of interest, demonstrating the psychological inadequacy of all time-preference theories of interest. But Knight's most important contribution consists in his analysis of the difference between risk and uncertainty. Risk, Knight argues, is a measurable probability that something could happen, like the probability that an individual will be struck by lightening or hit by a car. Uncertainty is a kind of immeasurable risk--e.g., predicting short term flucations in exchange rates. Knight's analysis is crucial to understanding economic reality. Knight's distinction between risk and uncertainty, for instance, explains why the rise of derivative securities in financial markets is so dangerous. Derivatives attempt to insure uncertainty, which is immeasurable, as if it were risk (which is measurable)."},{"Title":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","review":"Knight's work is a classic. Unfortunately, the Kessinger \\"reprint\\" listed here is actually a terrible photocopy of someone's desk copy of the old Houghton Mifflin printing. The print is dark and unclear and there are underlinings and marks on the text throughout this book from someone--I am not kidding when I say it is actually a photocopy. I am not sure how this is even legal, or why this product is sold on Amazon. Shame on them. I am returning my copy and going with another version. I suggest you do too."},{"Title":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","review":"Knight's Risk,Uncertainty and Profit(RUP) is a classic work ,especially with respect to Knight's analysis of the distinction between risk and uncertainty and the role each plays in the decision making calculus of the entreprenuer or the firm.For instance,Knight recognized that the negative impact of uncertainty could be reduced for those firms that were able to increase their size and get larger and larger over time.Advertising would allow firms to deal with the uncertainty of consumer responses to the introduction of new products over time ,as well as to changes in consumer preferences.Knight was the first to clearly recognize that economic profit is the return to the successful entreprenuer or owner of the firm to compensate them for the bearing of uncertainty.Knight's analysis of the connection between uncertainty and economic profit corrected the errors of Ricardo and Marx,who regarded economic profit as an unearned surplus .Keynes's integration of expected economic profit into the specification of his aggregate supply function,Z,where Z =P+wN(P equals expected economic profit),can be traced back to Knight's earlier discussions.It is strange that economists still are having trouble specifying Keynes's Z function nearly 70 years after the publication of the General Theory in 1936.However,Knight's theoretical analysis of uncertainty at both the micro and macro level is not as impressive as Schumpeter's analysis of uncertainty in his Theory of Economic Development(1912)or of the path breaking analysis of John Maynard Keynes in chapters 6 and 26 of the A Treatise on Probability(1921).In this latter book,Keynes operationalized a quantitative method of dealing with uncertainty(insufficient weight of the evidence,w)by means of his conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.This coefficient allows a decision maker to incorporate uncertainty and nonadditive probabilities into a technical analysis of decision making.The only author who comes close to Keynes is D.Ellsberg with his practically identical index to measure ambiguity called rho.There are still some unanswered questions that can be asked in this area of economic thought.Why didn't Knight cite the earlier work of Joseph Schumpeter on the risk versus uncertainty distinction?Further,why didn't Keynes cite both Knight and Schumpeter in his chapters 12 ,17 and 22,where he discussed the issue of the effect of uncertainty on investment in new capital goods and on stock market speculation?"},{"Title":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","review":"Even though the recent research in microeconomic theory has paid attention (somewhat reluctant in my opinion) to the topic of the \\"uncertainty\\", i.e. the Knightian uncertainty, it has not been successfully incorporated in the main theoretical framework, yet. The one of the evidences may be that we still cite D. Ellsberg's paper in QJE as the one of the most important work in this field: it is like citing Keynes' \\"General Theory\\" in every microeconomic paper as in 1950s and 1960s.The book is pleasant to read: it is full of insights, usually forgotten by now, including the complemental tendency of the theoretical and empirical works in economics. The most important accomplishment is that he argued that the exisence of the \\"uncertainty\\", the event whose probablity cannot be estimated priori or from empirical data, explains the instablity of the perfect competition, the (lucklustre) justification for the monopoly and the oligopoly, and the superiority of the private property system (capitalism). It is noticable that many phenomenons metioned in the book can be still applicable now, and the last part implies the author's thought regarding to the path of the capitalism, which is explored in more depth in Schumpeter's work despite the differences in two economists' predictions.Knight is one of the economist who lived in the transition of classical into neoclassical economics. The book predicts the emergence of more mathematical economists, but cannot escape from the influence of the former. The same thing can be said of the works of Schumpeter, Viner, and Veblen. Despite being one of the most famous economists, he and Schumpeter has no student who followed their lines of works: is it because their imaginative ways in conducting the reserach, or because of the trends in economics which trapped their students? (Stigler was a student of Knight, but which interest do their works share, except for their interests in history of economic thoughts?)It is worth reading because it reminds of what economics is or should be about, not because it prescribes the solution which could not be found in the modern economic works. We are witnessing the transition of several countries into the private economics with the mixed results. It should be noted that Hayek's work is the starting point in this field, the transition economics or the comparative economics, but Knight's work is more appropriate, pratical, and dynamical.Thus, if you are uncomfortable with the current economics, want to explore more idiosyncratic works in economics and think about the big picture in the path of the society, or are tempted to diverge from the dullness of the business books in your bookshelf, then this may what you have been looking for. Unless you are struck with the optimism that cannot be easily found in the present."},{"Title":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","review":"Frank Knight hit the ground running with his dissertation, which he published as Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. Knight makes a simple but important distinction between quantifiable risk and uncertainty. The distinction between risk and uncertainty is important in understanding markets, profits, and entrepreneurship. Knight connects entrepreneurship with uncertainty and profit. These factors do not square well with conventional notions of perfectly competitive equilibrium.Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit is a work of major importance. This book constitutes a serious alternative to the theories of entrepreneurship developed by Schumpeter and Kirzner. While most modern economists underemphasize entrepreneurship, Knight examines uncertainty and entrepreneurship as a way of bridging the gap between abstract theory and economic realities. Knight saw the obvious fact that we do not live in a world of perfect competition. He, like Shackle and Keynes, recognized that we must explain uncertainty if we are to ever understand how the capitalist system really works.Knight was a major figure in the generation of interwar economists who sought to explain the dynamics of capitalism. Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit is indispensable to anyone who aims at understanding uncertainty and dynamics in microeconomics, along with the work of Schumpeter, Hayek, Coase, Kaldor, Mises, Lachmann, and Shackle."},{"Title":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","review":"The author is expertly informed, and yet presents the concepts and data so that a layperson can follow the principles and even extrapolate how they apply to and can be employed in his or her own life."},{"Title":"Risk, Uncertainty and Profit","review":"This is the standard work in the field, give or take some stuff Keynes wrote on risk and capital."},{"Title":"Limits of State Action, The","review":"Liberty is at the heart of the Enlightenment experiment and the greatest question of our modern age (post-modernism not yet showing any lasting ability to transform societies). Humboldt was one of those men who championed the continuation of that experiment, to bring reason into human affairs, at a time when Europe began to move sideways into a love affair with Romanticism and folk culture. He also lived prior to the mass overturning of traditions that arose with the industrial revolution. Yet his well reasoned words still hold value in our materialistic, bureaucratic, and corporate world. This is a relatively faithful and accessible rendering of those words. They are worth savoring again and again, whether we love liberty from a left or right perspective, in order to understand that this yearning is part of the human condition. The desire to live one's life free of coercion, whether from majoritarian governments or quasi-private corporations or criminal enterprises masquerading as governments, is there inside our minds and hearts. If lovers of liberty keep that in mind, then the categories of left and right will seem less important and common ground seem more available. For in the end, as those thinkers of the past have pointed out, all lovers of liberty must ultimately stand together on the battlements and fight the good fight side by side, or they will find that liberty stolen from them."},{"Title":"Limits of State Action, The","review":"Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835) was a Prussian philosopher, linguist, educational theorist and diplomat. This book was written in 1791-2, but it was first published posthumously in 1850.He formulates his fundamental principle as follows: man should enjoy \\"the most absolute freedom of developing himself by his own energies, in his perfect indivdiduality, but in which external nature itself is left unfashioned by any human agency, but only receives the impress given to it by each individual by himself and of his own free will.\\" (Pg. 15)Humboldt argues that the State should not interfere with the well-being of citizens \\"except in the case of the most absolute necessity.\\" (Pg. 28) It should \\"abstain from all solicitide for the positive welfare of its citizens, and not to proceed a step further than is necessary for their mutual security and protection against foreign enemies.\\" (Pg. 33) It should only be concerned with the maintenance of security, both against the attacks of foreign enemies and internal dissensions. (Pg. 39). He views a State constitution, since it is always attended with restrictions of freedom, is only a \\"necessary evil.\\" (Pg. 137-138)Remembering that Humboldt was a diplomat during 1802-1819 (which included the Napoleonic Wars period), he states that war is \\"one of the most salutary phenomena for the culture of human nature.\\" (Pg. 41) He says that the State \\"should in no way attempt to encourage war, but neither should it forcibly interfere to prevent it, when required by necessity.\\" (Pg. 45)He opines that the State must \\"wholly refrain from every attempt to operate directly or indirectly on the morals and character of the nation.\\" (Pg. 81) It is not to concern itself with \\"the positive welfare of its citizens, and hence, not with their life or health, except where these are imperilled by the actions of others.\\" (Pg. 89) Or as he summarizes, the State must prohibit or restrict such actions only \\"as imply in their consequences the infringement of others' rights, or encroach on their freedom or property without their consent.\\" (Pg. 91)Humboldt's early statement of the \\"harm principle\\" as later articulated by John Stuart Mill inOn Liberty, and Humboldt's general \\"libertarian\\" approach make this book of continuing interest to students of political philosophy."},{"Title":"Limits of State Action, The","review":"I feel a sense of responsibility and urgency to write this review in regards to what the only other reviewer of the Liberty edition has submitted: Wilhelm von Humboldt has nothing to do with \\"Libertarian socialism\\" - that statement is simply oxymoronic.

The role of liberty in the development of the individual.3.) The necessary criteria to be met in allowing the state to limit individual actions.4.) The manner in which it is prudent to confine the state to its proper role.F.A. Hayek, who utterly rejected socialism, considered Humboldt to be Germany's greatest philosopher of freedom. Humboldt's purpose was to juxtapose the ancient ideals of a pursuit for excellence with the concept of negative liberty - which was later elucidated by Isaiah Berlin. If you are interested in the foundations of classical liberalism, I would suggest reading the works of Hayek, Humboldt, Hobhouse, Collingwood, Berlin, Oakeshott, and Mill. However, if you are interested in socialism I would recommend reading Marx, Proudhon, Feuerbach, Hegel, Rousseau, Richard Pipes' \\"Property and Freedom,\\" Joshua Muravchik's \\"Heaven on Earth,\\" and especially, \\"News from Nowhere,\\" by William Morris."},{"Title":"Limits of State Action, The","review":"In &quot;The Limits of State Action&quot; Enlightenment thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt describes the leading principle of his thought as being the essential importance of human development in its richest diversity - a principle that is not only undermined by the narrow search for efficiency through division of labour, but by wage labour itself.Humboldt espouses the libertarian view that whatever labour &quot;does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness&quot;; when the labourer works under external control, &quot;we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is.&quot;Essentially anticapitalist in its nature,&quot;The Limits of State Action&quot; provides insight into the philosophy of libertarian socialism, anarchy and educational reform.

Wollheim & Terry Carr. Inside are fifteen stories which were first published during 1965, although there is one exception; Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Sunjammer\\", which was first published in \\"Boy's Life\\" in March of 1964. The majority of these stories received nominations for a Nebula award. This was the Nebula Award's first year, and they allowed a lot of nominations. Nevertheless, with seven of the short stories in this collection nominated, and four of the novelettes, clearly many of the works included here were highly thought of.The most renown of the stories in this collection clearly is \`\\"Repent Harlequin!\\" Said the Ticktockman' by Harlan Ellison. This story won the Hugo and the Nebula awards for short story in 1966, and tied for 7th on the 1971 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for short fiction. It also finished 2nd in the 1999 Locus All-Time Poll for Short Stories. It is a tremendous story of a man who rebels against a system where time has become the force which controls society.There are numerous well-known authors with works included in this collection. In addition to the aforementioned Ellison and Clarke, we have selections from seasoned writers such as Clifford D. Simak (\\"Over the River and Through the Woods\\"), James H. Schmitz (\\"Planet of Forgetting\\"), Lin Carter (\\"Uncollected Works\\"), Fritz Leiber (\\"The Good New Days\\"), and a Berserker story from Fred Saberhagen (\\"Masque of the Red Shift\\"). There are also stories from newer authors at the time, such as Larry Niven (\\"Becalmed in Hell\\"), and the first story from Vernor Vinge (\\"Apartness\\").Wollheim and Carr would publish a total of six of these anthologies together, with Donald Wollheim continuing the series after Terry Carr's leaving with Arthur W. Saha until Wollheim's death in 1990. Terry Carr went on to start another anthology series called \\"Best Science Fiction of the Year\\" until his death in 1987. While this collection doesn't include international stories the way the 1965 collection did, it does live up to the title of \\"Best\\" with a superb collection of stories."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"It might have been easy for Doyle to write Paddy Clarke as he did from the child's point of view, not least because he has been a child.

The pride and humiliations she experiences are sharply contrasted with the cowardly male - Charlo - in her life.

Although it was slow to take off, I kept on because I had read great reviews for it on this site. The scattered narrative style is confusing yet effective. I wept near the end but was a bit disappointed at the abrubt conclusion that failed to resolve any real issues. In short, how a man could have written with such sensitivity about Paula's tragic situation is beyond me."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I bought this book years ago... but didn't read it until recently. Overall, I was very impressed with Roddy Doyle's writing style - and definitely impressed by his ability to write from a woman's perspective. In fact, my only real complaint with this book is its utter lack of plot. I was expecting a story of a woman who, though battered, pulled herself together and how she did it. Instead, the book read: \\"I met Charlo, I married Charlo, Charlo hit me, I'm an alco.\\" Great detail was given with respect to Paula's hiding of (and subsequent searches for) the key to the locked liquor shed, but this thread was not allowed to develop. Nicola is aware of her mother's drinking, but nothing is said, nothing is done, nothing is faced. If nothing was to come of Paula's repeated \\"alco\\" comments, I felt that Doyle shouldn't have bothered mentioning it. In short, there is no resolution. The story meanders from one tale of abuse to another until finally, \\"this is how I threw him out\\"... So, despite the excellence of the writing, this novel fails because it simply has no storyline, character development, or resolution. Does Paula just continue on in her miserable life, with nothing getting better?... WHY, exactly, did John Paul leave (Doyle could have had a wonderful subplot with that, but just lets it fade)?Additionally, I got a bit irritated with the fact that Doyle repeated ENTIRE PARAGRAPHS over and over. More than once I had the feeling that I had bought a defective book. I kept checking to make sure that I actually had turned the page (i.e. \\"someone is in pain...\\" - that entire paragraph is repeated verbatim on the following page), and although I realize that it was done for emphasis, I failed to understand just what point, exactly, Doyle was trying to underscore..."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This book was very repetitive and extremely difficult to follow. It was the first book I purchased when I got my new Kindle, and even though I don't like to get rid of books, it was also the first and book I've deleted."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I thought that &quot;The Woman Who Walked Into Doors&quot; was a nice story. The beginning is nice but in the middle of the book it gets a little bit long-winded and boring. The end of the book was very touching and I think that this book shows how it is when somebody you love mishandles you. Overall it's a nice book but sometimes I almost fell in sleep because it was too boring and long-winded. It was also a long story so I recommend to people who have to read this book for their english assignment Make a good planning!!!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"It is was of the most amazing novels I have ever read. It was completely involving, with stunning realism. It is hard to put into words the emotions it stirs up whilest you are reading it. It is absolutely impossible to put down and read without crying for Paula. It is very thought provoking and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Through the first half of the book I felt this was just another &quot;oh whoa is me&quot; literary self-portrait. Oh boy was I mistaken. When the reason behind the main characters whining is revealed this book took a turn for the best. It is so worth the struggle through the first half. Trust me."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I recently was made aware of this author and decided to read this book before I read others he's written. An Irish friend told me that it is grim! And it is, but well worth the reading.I found it frightening at times, but such a good account of a woman who had an abusive husband and just couldn't find the courage to get away from him. At last she does after 17 years of beatings.This is a book that should be read by all women in a similar situation and for those who are trying to get them to leave the abuser!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Best Book of the Year! Definitely the best read for me in 2000, and I am a daily reader. When I reached the end of this book, I started all over again and enjoyed this book as much the second time around. This is something I never have the time to do. There is definitely a love story being told amid the unraveling of the painful side of Paula Spencer's married life. Here is someone brutalized by almost 2 decades of marital tyranny and she can still retell the joys and growing pains of childhood. I want to give this book to everyone. It should definitely be required reading for medical and ER personnel."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"\\"For seventeen years. There wasn't one minute when I wasn't afraid, when I wasn't waiting. Waiting for him to to go, waiting for him to come. Waiting for the fist, waiting for the smile. I was brainwashed and brain-dead, a zombie for hours, afraid to think, afraid to stop, completely alone.\\" ~ And that is the voice of the woman who walked into doors, thirty-nine year old Paula Spencer, alcoholic, abused Irish housewife.The Woman Who Walked into Doorsis an acutely painful reading experience. Roddy Doyle gives the reader a shockingly visceral view of domestic violence through the battered heart, mind and soul of Paula Spencer. This book leaves burns; it is a punch in the guts; it penetrates to the nerve center. But Doyle manages to make the reader understand Paula, her inner life, her thought processes, her interior monologues, her motivations, her desires.\\"...Because, because, because. He demolished me. He destroyed me. And I never stopped loving him. I adored him when he stopped. I was grateful, so grateful, I'd have done anything for him. I loved him...\\"The Woman Who Walked into Doorsis the stream-of-consciousness narrative voice of Paula. Her voice is genuine, a mixture of her spirit and her grief. It is the perfect approach to such disturbing subject matter: domestic violence, spousal abuse, rape, alcoholism, poverty. With brilliant prose and sensitive rendering of memory, Doyle aims for a heartfelt human uderstanding rather than a clinical understanding of Paula Spencer.\\"He picked me off the ground. And I loved him. He picked me up and held me. He cried on my head. I needed him. For years I thought that I needed him, that I could never recover without him; I was looking for everything I got. I provoked him. I was useless.\\"But Paula's narrative speaks not only of pain and despair. She can rally memories of a childhood that was happy and content, teenage years that were unabashed and spirited, a young romance with her Charlo that was passionate and intoxicating, a wedding day which was the happiest and loveliest day of her life, the birth of her children who give her reason to live. Her memories are rich and full of lilting Dublin wit and charm. Her memories help her find redemption as do her strength and resilience.The Woman Who Walked into Doorsis an extraordinary novel, composed with sensitivity and compassion. The subject matter may be disturbing but the lasting effect is promising and hopeful. It is a painful and beautiful story which makes the heart ache but the spirit soar."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"To say that I enjoyed The Woman Who Walked into Doors would not be the right description. The book is a rather harrowing depiction of a woman in the grip of spousal abuse and alcoholism. A woman who tries, in a now familiar story, to reconcile the idea of a man who loves her with a man who beats her.I was suspicious about anyone who isn't Paula Spencer (or someone very close to her) claiming the experience of poverty, alcoholism, and abuse in a first person narrative fiction. As it happens, however, Doyle does a credible job with this. Given the time that he spends in Paula's head, I had the feeling that he was trying to work out the question that many of us have watching a situation like that-- why? why does she stay? how does she survive?What's really nice about the work is that it resists the temptation to make Paula and her situation sentimental. That resistance makes the real love that she has for Charlo really affecting. She clings to it in the face of all reason and against all circumstance. I do not feel as though I closed the book any wiser about why a battered wife stays battered, but I did feel as though it lifted a little corner off the mystery as to how you keep loving someone who torments you. And how little/much that love means stacked up against the other other aspects of the relationship.In the end I found it a good book, if often a little bit difficult to read. It is not a pleasant subject, and Doyle doesn't pull his punches. For me I found that it missed something-- something larger than the main idea, perhaps. That something kept me from finding it a great book. But it was still certainly a worthy use of time, and a book that I would recommend. I would particularly recommend it if you have some special interest in the treatment of the subject matter.A number of my friends recommendedPaula Spencerand even noted that they liked that better. I'll be giving it a try.(p.s. From reading reviews here and online reviews, it appears that a lot of readers are picking up Doyle based on a recommendation from Rowling. This book is really really different from anything she's written, and you should be prepared for very dark material, adult language, and physical/emotional violence if you pick this up.)"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I would recommend this book to a friend. It is not a happy story, but the main character is immensely likable, and her story is interesting and worth reading. I liked Paula Spencer. She's funny, insightful, vulnerable and charming. She is also flawed, which makes her seem very real to me. It was hard to read this book though, because the shadow of her tragedy creeps across every page. Doyle waits until the final chapters to tell us, though, about Paula's battering at the hands of a man she loves, her \\"shattered\\" husband, Charlo. The title tells us what we do and do not want to know, so I think it's fine that Doyle waits until the end to reveal it all.This book is written in the first person, and as an American the Irish vernacular was initially difficult for me, but Paula's inner dialogue is well written, and very enjoyable. I think I might have picked up a few Irish colloquialisms.Kudos to Roddy Doyle! He has created a wonderful, likable, character in Paula Spencer."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"In 'The Woman Who Walked into Doors', Doyle tells the story of a battered wife. He explores the depths of Paula's mind, thoughts, feelings and memories. We see the effect of a cruel male-dominated working-class society on a young, ambitious but vulnerable girl. Through the novel Paula is cast as a victim of male abuse. A victim of her father, her younger brother, her husband and even strangers in the street ('...Jesus, if you went wrong once you were a slut. -Slut. My little brother. -Slut. My Father. -Slut. Everyone. They were all in on it.') Doyle successfully attempts to convince his readers of the realism of Paula's situation. Doyle manipulates narrative structure and language to create a real sense of intimacy with his protagonist Paula. He creates a mass of confusion, misunderstanding and sorrow. He deliberatly skips around Paula'a memories in order to mirror her confusion and desperation. He calls out for help for the repressed section of society that is chosen to be ignored by the rest. Paula is so deeply in love with Charlo that she is blinded to the truth, he is a monster. She is forced to realise and accept the situation. The end of the novel shows Paula, as she overcomes a violent marriage, a violent childhood, a repressed potential and an addiction to alcohol for the love of her children."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"'Master piece' - Those two small words sum up this contemporary classic perfectly.Doyle tells Paula's gritty tale, against the backdrop of the darker side of Dublin. Her sad, but somehow unsurprising story of a life sentence inflicted by her husband - Charlo, is a recognizable ordeal to people all over the globe.The battered cleaner tells her life story through the pen of Doyle. His immense skill is apparent - the interpretation of a woman's perspective, her emotions and interactions, are indistinguishably accurate.The shocking abuse sequences do not indulge in unnecessary heinous violence. The flow of the story follows Paula's train of thought, at times through rose tinted spectacles, but others in the cold, harsh, light of day.Doyle really has the knack of creating fiction so full of realism - like a mirror image. He knows 'people', he has the ability to make all of his characters so lifelike, you can almost touch them. The use of humour, horrific, sad and nostalgic material all add to the authentic quality of the book.A fantastic eye opener of a novel. It will grip you with almost as much force as Charlo.Read it. Love it. Hate it."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Try to imagine dragging yourself up morning after morning for seventeen years, to face another day of unpredictable savagery. This is the life of Paula Spencer, a mother and wife beaten daily by her husband; left unconscious on the floor. Yet for each and every one of each and every day in those seventeen years, she loved her husband and never left him. In fact, she gave no blame to him, and just a \`sweet, innocent smile from his face made everything better again'. Deep inside, Paula felt that her husband needed her, and that she was doing her best to keep things together - as it was \`her fault for opening her big mouth all the time'. She did not tell anyone of what he did to her, she carried on as normal, carrying the weight of her suffering without any help. Are these the actions of a heroine, or a victim? Is she doing this to help her kids, her husband and the people around her or is she too afraid to stand up to her husband or to leave him?Read the book and decide for youtself"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I recently read and discussed the Irish author Roddy Doyle's amazing work of voice and dialogue, \\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\"(1997) in a novel writing course. Although I had seen the 1991 movie adaptation of Doyle's \\"The Commitments\\", I had no idea it was an adaptation at the time and since then had not run into any of his extensive work. Among other notable works, he won the Booker Prize in 1993 for a novel called \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\", written from the perspective of a ten-year-old boy.\\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\" is told from the point-of-view of a thirty-nine-year-old Irish working class woman who, well, walked into doors (as they say). It is well-crafted and the woman's voice quite believable. It is so well done, in fact, that it is painful to read at times. The story arc gives away much of the climax at the very beginning of the book, a trend in the novels that we have read so far.We discussed in class Doyle's use of the the tell-all approach in terms of craft. Should you build to a climax using suspense to draw your reading into the story world--the \\"traditional\\" approach? Or can you spill the beans on the first page and then lead your reader into the finer nuances of truth and psychology behind the facts of the climax? The answer is: of course you can do both! The question is what subject matter or characters will be best served by each approach?Read Doyle. It is not \\"light\\" or \\"easy\\" in terms of subject matter. But I did hear that this particular novel is his most bleak."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"In this book, Roddy Doyle creates a character who is just like anyone you'd meet on the street.

This is an excellent book for bibliotherapy or anyone who enjoys a good story from a master storyteller."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors is an amazing book, terribly honest too. Couldn't finish it the first time I read it, after the Barrytown Trilogy I decided to reread it and got to appreciate it. Paula is living and charming, it's hard to imagine such delicate feelings of a woman is written by a man. Roddy Doyle wrote about this woman and her terrible married life with the utmost accuracy, he's probably one of the best novelists around."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I had to skip over 20 or 30 pages of this book. Perhaps this is a testament to the power of Roddy Doyle's writing, but the violent dissolution of Charlo and Paula Spencer's marriage into a morass of alcoholism and abuse was too brutal for me to read. I did pick it back up toward the end, and read the last 25 pages or so, and while I found the ending strangely rewarding, I couldn't help but feel that it would have been doubly so if I had been able to stomach the entire book. In that way, the book became a little inaccessable for me."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"2. Roddy Doyle has proven himself once again.

There are no signs that show that the true writer of this story is a man, because the first person point of view is totally credible and understandable.

He always makes me feel as well as think and you can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Roddy Doyle has long excelled at tales of the Irish working (or not-working) class. Here he takes a somewhat different approach, telling his story from the perspective of Paula Spencer, an alcoholic, battered wife and mother entering early middle age. I can't speak from experience -- I'm all man, baby -- but I think Doyle pulls off Paula's voice convincingly. He doesn't beat the reader over the head with pathos, trying to force us to pity Paula. Paula is matter-of-fact about her life: the good times, the bad times, the triumphs and the tragedies. \\"I want to tell the truth,\\" she says. \\"Like it happened. Plain and simple.\\" She's not emotionless. It's just the way she lives, it's just the way things are. And that tone makes her story all the more affecting. \\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\" is a quick and easy read, but Doyle packs a lot of power into his deceptively simple prose, and Paula Spencer stays with the reader well beyond the final page."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This is one of the best books I hav come across in a long time!!!!!! The insight that the reader is given into a home of a battered wife is so beleivable it is easily forgotten that this book is written bya man.

Again I would reconmend this book to any one!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I recieved this book as a present on my birthday and began reading it straight away, a big mistake ! I couldn't put the book down and spent my birthday in reading and drying my eyes"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Paula O'Leary, the narrator of this story, is an abused wife. But it wasn't always that way. She has fond memories of meeting and marrying Charlo Spencer, the man of her dreams. However, she also has memories of him beating her until he exhausted himself, raping her, waking her up with a boot to the stomach.Paula lived with this man, trapped by her poverty, her lack of self worth, her despair and fear. She feels that Charlo is the only man or person who sees her when she feels invisible. She becomes an alcohlic.It's only when Charlo stares at his daughter with hate filled eyes that Paula realises that she must stop him. She has to break the cycle in order to protect her children as best as she can.Roddy Doyle has written a painful and graphically real story with an amazing lead character. I really felt for her when Charlo would escort her to the hospital after a beating and she would silently plead with the doctors or nurses to ask how the injury happened. Instead all they saw was a drunk who kept falling down stairs and walking into doors."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Paula Spencer is a battered wife, and The Woman Who Walked Into Doors the story of how that came to be. Paula's history unfolds against a backdrop of a her thuggish husband's last crime -- the kidnapping of a banker's wife which goes horribly awry. To cope with a marriage that quickly turns violent, Paula crawls into the bottle, and as her alcoholism deepens, her family grows, and the addition of recklessly endangered children compromises the reader's sympathy for Paula's plight. Still, she is funny and strong, as are many of the other characters, and the reward for sharing her burden is learning of her survival."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Roddy Doyle was born in Dublin in 1958 and saw his first novel, \\"The Commitments\\" published in 1987. It was later adapted for the big screen, a version that saw Star Trek's Colm Meaney and a very young Andrea Corr among the cast. Doyle went on to win the Booker Prize in 1993 with \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\". This is his sixth novel and was first published in 1996.\\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\" is set in Dublin and is told by Paula Spencer, a woman in her late thirties. Both Paula's parents are dead, while only two of her siblings 'appear' in the book - her sisters, Carmel and Denise. She did have another sister, Wendy, who died in a motorbike accident, while her brothers - Roger, Edward and George - are only ever mentioned in passing. Paula's relationship with her father had once been good, though it seemed to have deteriorated as time went on. (Carmel, on the other hand, hated their father and subscribes to the view that all men are b@$t@rds). Paula, meanwhile, hasn't Roger in years, and isn't particularly bothered about it - theirs was another difficult relationship.However, it's Paula's relationship with her husband, Charlo, that's central to the book. They have been separated for over a year as the book opens - though they are still technically, married. They couple had four children together, three of whom still live with Paula. (She hasn't seen her eldest son, John-Paul, in quite some time: she last heard of him squatting in some flats and suspects he's on heroin). She works as a cleaner, just about earns enough to make ends meet and is an alcoholic. As if all that isn't enough, the book opens with the arrival of a policeman at her front door to inform her of Charlo's death. Paula spends the book looking back over her life in general and her time with Charlo in particular.While it isn't always a very cheerful book, Paula's story isn't one that will leave you feeling depressed. She proves to be a character you want the best for and, not only does she manage to raise a smile from time to time, she also manages to leave you with a bit of hope. Absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This entire book is a stream-of-conscious reminiscence of a 39-year-old Dublin widow. Nobody else speaks, except through her memory. It is a memory that has lost one-fourth of her life due to abuse of alcohol and abuse of herself by her husband. She doesn't remember anything from the 80s. She is a mother of four; it would have been five, except she fell down stairs, or walked into a door, or something. She's waiting desperately for someone to ask her. Ask her what really happened. But, nobody does. Nurses take her word for being clumsy. Doctors look at body parts, but never at her. Nobody asks. So, she continues taking it because she loves him, and he loves her. That's her belief and she's sticking to it. As Doyle has shown us in previous books, such as The Commitments and The Snapper, he knows how to capture the spirit of the Irish. He has certainly done it with Paula Spencer, nee O'Leary. There is not a false note anywhere in this book. If you have any feelings at all, you will get caught up in her tale of woe. But, don't take me wrong. It's not all horror. There are laughs and smiles aplenty along the way; after all, this is the Irish. Then comes the day when the husband goes too far. It's interesting to contemplate who she is telling her life story to; she indicates that she might be writing it down. But why, and for whom. It's a quick read with the pages flying by as we become emotionally committed to the life that is portrayed within."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I was completely caught up in this book from beginning to end and was sorry when i reached the last page.

Paula is full of strength, courage and wit in spite of everything. She is an every woman for the times that we live in. Charlo, although he could be any of a million men, is her downfall, her drug, and the man who drags her down and keeps her in her circle of despair. But like all drugs he is hard to give up, not until he dies, which comes in the first chapters so I'm not giving anything away there, is she free, but it's all too late. She is married to Charlo for nearly two decades; it is a time of alcohol, violence and crime. Despair seeps from ever page mixed up with nostalgia and thick black humour to ease the pain of the reader. The characters are so alive that this book hurts to read at times, Doyle's characterisations are near perfect.Paula is a flawed character reflecting the life that she has led. Roddy Doyle makes it obvious from the start that there was never any escaping for Paula, from birth, from school, from adolescence she was always on the same path. You can leave the oppressive slum, but the oppressive, esteem robbing slum will never leave you. Paula is told what she is from birth and has no option but to believe it.An excellently written book that pulls no punches and doesn't try to spare Paula her fate, but it's so sad that I prefer to pretend that it isn't happening, see, there's a lot of Paula in us all."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"The reflections of Paula Spencer, a thirty-nine year-oldmother of four, a recent widow, a survivor of seventeenyears of spousal abuse, a reluctant alcoholic, a cleaningwoman, and a powerful representation of a wee bit of hopeemerging from absolute hopelessness. Her husband, Charlo,has been recently killed by the police after murdering awoman in a botched bank robbery attempt. Much of the painportrayed in Paula's reflections comes in a tidal waveresponse to Charlo's final brutal attack. The reader islead down a painful personal tour of Paula's desperate life.In January, 1996 Doyle introduced this marvelous work with abrief short story in the New Yorker called &quot;Ask Me, Ask Me,Ask Me.&quot; Those words are what Paula Spencer hopes everydoctor, any nurse, a friend, or even a relative will askwhen her feeble excuses like &quot;fell down the stairs&quot; or&quot;walked into a door&quot; become too common or just toounbelievable as her injuries become frequent and moresevere. I believed the essay failed in representing awoman's literary voice by a male author: the sentencestructure too long, the paragraphs too logical, the completework too linear. Once I leaped into the book, I wasoverwhelmed by Doyle's brilliant new style. This is a vividportrayal of abused woman, and never failing in a continuityof a feminine literary style. Unlike Sharon in The Snapper,Doyle represses his innate masculinity and explores withsuch precision and dedication the character of Paula. In myprevious reading of Paddy Clarke, I raved about thecharacterization of the turmoil of a young Dublin boy, acharacter with whom Roddy Doyle could easily associate.Obviously, the far more advanced Paula Spencer is more of astretch, and his accomplishment of this character is alandmark that will catapult Roddy Doyle into the echelon ofIrish literary genius.So as all naysayers may comment on the continued commercialsuccess of another new movie based on the third of hisBarrytown trilogy (based on The Van, scheduled to bereleased late 1996) and who wish to associate him more alongthe lines of the godawful Michael Crichton or Scott Turrow,I'll mock and laugh at every one of them as Doyle slowlycontinues to win the respect and admiration of the public,his peers, literary critics, and every last bleedingIrish literary academic scholar."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"The book I have carries a picture of the author. He looks like a regular guy, almost inconspicuous, quietly \\"nice\\", but that little ear stud is the surprise - a glitter of something that doesn't seem to quite fit...And that's what's so incredible about the book. I completely agree with J. K. Kelley's comments. Doyle is a clssic and genuine ventriloquist. And as I went through the book revisiting the protagonist's wounds and memories through the tears in the body, I ended up in a place where there was little light but profound wisdom. I think, in a way, this was the book (along with Maythil Radhakrishnan's \\"The Love Song of Alfred Hitchcock\\") that brought me back to my faith (and I am not even referring to religion). In many ways, it's the opposite of Paddy, where the end leaves you feeling helpless and caught in the whirl of the everydayness and the sense of a cold finality. This one drags you through the dirt, tearing your skin, bruising your soul, but ends with a sense of the lush green, and a flicker of hope. You have to read both. You'll lose a bit of yourself if you don't."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Let the gushing begin...I read this book twice in a row, then a 3rd time a few weeks later after lending it to a friend. Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha was my first encounter with Roddy Doyle, and I've since read The Commitments as well, but this remains my favorite.The most startling thing about the book is that it is written by a man, because the first-person female narrative is so accurate and never feels forced.Those who critique this book as plotless are looking at it the wrong way - there is no clear beginning, middle and end because we are looking at a cross-section of a person's life. It's messy and honest and sometimes difficult to handle.As for typos, my copy also had a few that were likely the result of cheap publishing. However, I would bet that several readers, especially those who have never read Doyle before, do not realize that some punctuation and grammatical errors are intentional. Paula is an uneducated alcoholic struggling to stay above the poverty line. You'll notice that when she's drinking, her 'speech' is often different than when she is talking about work or her children. In Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, Patrick, the main character, talks in the mile-a-minute, stream-of-consciousness way that all 8-year olds do, which isn't necessarily grammatically correct. It's this writing style that makes Doyle's writing human; sometimes wince-inducingly so.(Also, Americans might struggle reading the thick Dublin-ese. I did.)I don't have page numbers at hand, but a few of my favorite excerpts are when she is riding the DART with the woman she cleans office buildings with, and imagining spilling her guts to the woman, a virtual stranger. The times she recalls her wedding and when she and Charlo were first dating not only offer comic relief to an otherwise brutal book, but also give a glimpse as to why, sadly, she would endure his abuse.The beauty of Doyle's writing is in the minor, day-to-day details he mentions, making Paula so real.When Doyle finally gets to the details of the abuse, the words are relentlessly pulverizing, and we as readers can almost feel the blows, feeling exhausted by the end, imagining what this woman has endured.Paula's relationship with her sister Carmel is complex and insightful as well, and is fleshed out beautifully as a subplot.A long review, but I cannot say enough good things about this book. I only wish I could say more eloquently what this book means to me."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"The only reason that I read this book is because of J.K. Rowling. I read an article in Oprah magazine about J.K. Rowling and she stated that this was one of her all time favorite books. In fact, she said that Roddy Doyle was her favorite author. Had to read it. And it is good.The Woman Who Walked Into Doors is the story of an abused dejected woman named Paula Spencer. Known as the most accident-prone patient at the emergency room, Paula recounts her life story from childhood to adulthood.Paula was taken aback by Charlo. She said : I swooned the first time I saw Charlo. I actually did. I didn't faint or fall on the floor but my legs went rubbery on me and I giggled. I suddenly knew that I had lungs because they were empty and collapsing.Her first dance with Charlo made her his. He had her all wrapped up and then some.Throughout her marriage to Charlo, she lost herself and kept to herself. Each time she visited the hospital she told them she had fallen. No questions were asked. No further questions.It is a heart wrenching story told in a woman's voice by the author -a man. What a superb job he does of delivering all emotions and thoughts that a despondent woman would have.The journey of her life with Charlo, how she bounced back, how she coped, and how she now deals is vividly displayed. You won't want to put the book down. It was a great and easy read.Roddy Doyle won the Booker Prize for Paddy Clarke ha ha ha. Iplan on reading that next. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"The women who walked into doors is a very sad story. It's about Paula who is being abused by her husband, Charlo. Because of al the raping and kicking of her husband, she starts drinking alcohol a lot. She has a couple of kids, which she wants to grow up normal, so she has to stay with Charlo. Without him she cannot raise them up. At the end she kicks Charlo out of their house, after seventeen years being abused by him. I got very sad when I read the story. Everything she is going through is just so bad. The book is not so difficult to read, but sometimes a little bit boring."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This Irish novel about a battered and alcoholic Dublin woman owes a little to a proletariat and naturalistic traditional of novel writing (James T. Farrell's Studs Lonigan comes to mind) that I thought was dead. The first person narration by the central character, Paula Spencer, is painfully real. It's hard not to identify with her. She seems trapped by her poverty and lack of education and her attraction to the wrong kind of man. I found Doyle's treatment of this all too familiar scenario interesting, especially as we see her many years later, but somewhat one-sided. The Irish terms and the lower middle class venue enlivened the narrative and Doyle has a fine eye for sexual and social detail. Nonetheless the tale is dreary in an all too familiar way and his obvious pandering to his female readership is a little embarrassing for a writer as good as he is. I suspect that Doyle was torn between attraction to his central male character, a violent, macho wife beater; but because of his need to be politically correct with feminism, he was never able to develop his character beyond the straw man.The clever title on one level is a euphemism for a batted woman, but on another suggests something deeper, a blind tropism that the woman couldn't help. I think Doyle needed to develop that potential in the character of the husband as well. For a novelist the toughest thing often is to tell the psychological truth in spite of, and in the face of what your readership expects. Although I have no sympathy for wife beaters, and certainly none for Doyle's pathetic wretch, it is not enough to show that the wife is a victim. The husband is as well. And she makes choices. In the proletariat tradition the cause was poverty; today it is either the \\"daemonic nature\\" of males or the values of the patriarchy that lead to the violence. None of these answers is the whole story."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I thought that &quot;The Woman Who Walked Into Doors&quot; was a nice story. The beginning is nice but in the middle of the book it gets a little bit long-winded and boring. The end of the book was very touching and I think that this book shows how it is when somebody you love mishandles you. Overall it's a nice book but sometimes I almost fell in sleep because it was too boring and long-winded. It was also a long story so I recommend to people who have to read this book for their english assignment Make a good planning!!!(Nice greetings to mevr.

I found all the cursing distracting, and made the flow of the book choppy.

The book's topic is great, but you don't get to the topic until you are three-quarters of the way though the book! I made myself keep reading until I got to the actual topic of the story, but I think it started on about page 160, and there are only 226 pages in the book. So, if you can handle complete boredom until then, you may like the book. I do like background and history on the characters, but it should not consume the entire book. I have not read any other of this author's books, so maybe it was just the writing style I did not like. In summary, if you bore easily, do not read this book."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I thought this book &quot;The Woman Who Walked Into Doors&quot; was a very visual book. As you read this book you could actually visualise the violence going on and the pain Paula was experiencing. I don't read many books and this was the 1st Roddy Doyle book i had read and i can that i would read another of his books. I only gave this book a star rating of three because i feel that the book did not really have a proper ending, It doesn't tell you whaty happens to Paula after the death of Charlo. Does she get a better life? or stay miserable for the rest of her life? Did she meet another man? Does she manage to defeat her alcoholic problem?

His fiction was too real and depressing. Plus it was hard to follow as he jumped from the past to present day often."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This is probably Roddy Doyle's best work, and very unlike the rather shallow, though amusing, stories making up his Barrytown trilogy. The Woman Walked Into Doors is the harrowing story of a young Irish woman being abused by her husband, and her battle with herself before she manages to stand up to him. It is the sort of book that leaves one nauseous at times, as if from a blow to the stomach, but is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This book is incredible. As ever, Doyle's writing is staggeringly good. This time he writes from the point of view of a woman and it's wholly convincing. At times hilarious, often touching, the story moves into harrowing territory as it becomes clear that Paula is a battered wife.This is not a &quot;feelgood&quot; book, but I urge you to read it and then try the rest of his work. It's not all quite as good as this, but it's streets ahead of countless others."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This book was fantastic I could hardly beleve Roddy Doyle's ability to grasp the topic of domestic violence of a woman so realisticly as he is a man! I recommend anyone of any age should read it, I did and did a review on it for my Higher(A level) English."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Roddy Doyle's latest book is an amazing tetimony to the writer's craft and even more to the soul of this writer, so sensitive and receptive to both universal and female sentiments and concerns to be able to create a woman protagonist (a battered woman) and speak through her voice without our ever stopping to question the author's gender. I have never been battered nor been in close contact, knowingly, with any battered women but his book made me feel so involved with the main character's problems that I was shocked to the core. And the writing is brilliant. It's a must!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Roody Doyle has done it again. I throughly enjoyed Paddy Clarke and the Barrytown trilogy, but this book is perhaps the most profound of all of them, and the best example of his gritty style's brilliance. Paula Spencer is in some ways a tragic heroine, her fatal flaw being her love for her husband, Charlo. I have fortunately never had to walk in her shoes, but I feel I have lived her life and been able to learn from it. Few novels I have read have had that power. Paula is a rich character, and her story, in Doyle's sensetive hands, is unforgetable."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"In THE WOMAN WHO WALKED INTO DOORS, Doyle does an excellent job of weaving the story of Paula and Charlo. He tackles the social problem of spousal abuse head on and asks the difficult question: &quot;Why does society allow this to happen?&quot; In doing so, he forces the reader to examine his/her own culpability in relation to social problems. At times depressing, and always troublesome, THE WOMAN WHO WALKS INTO DOORS triumphs in the end."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This is the mesmerizing, powerful and vicious story of an alcoholic, abused housewife in Dublin. The depth of emotion in the story is impressive. The pace and dialogue were spot-on. I've known more than one battered woman, and the main character in this story captures the strength and the terror of that situation.Very powerful novel, highly recommended, though it's not enjoyable due to its subject matter. It's not over-dramatized; it's simply in-your-face realism."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Well written, gritty portrayal of lower class Irish life in the 60s- now. To understand some of the phrasing and Irish idioms, it helps to keep an Irish accent in mind while reading it. The main character narrates a graphic synopsis of her day to day life including aspects of a difficult marriage, family complications, childhood memories, dubious social conventions and alcoholism. It was intersting to contrast growing up in Ireland with the US and note the similarities and differences. Excellent, no frills story of the life lead by many uninspired young women."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Being a huge Roddy Doyle fan this novel and its companion, \\"Paula Spencer,\\" about the same implacable woman do not disappoint. One has to admire a male writer's ability to get inside a woman's heart, mind and soul to the depth that Doyle achieves. Of course he seems to be able to do that with any character, from a young boy growing up in middle class Ireland(Paddy Clark, Ha, Ha, Ha) to IRA fighters both male and female (A Stat Named Henry) to a cast of Irish and American characters cavorting through the jazz era (Oh Play That Thing.)Each of the mentioned books is a masterpiece, but these two are pure genius. They tweak every one of our emotions and paint a picture of lower middle class life that is so real it bleeds.Michael D.

This book gripped me from the start---the voice of the protagonist, the abrupt style of the narrative, the stream of consciousness writing with its deliberate repetition---I had to force myself to slow down so I wouldn't miss anything. The language and the syntax is so compelling.It also floored me that this was written by a man. There wasn't a moment that I questioned whether this was a woman speaking. Even his characterizations of other female characters rang true, especially the sister Carmel, and the three sister's triangular relationship.I would have given this book 5 stars but for the ending (and I don't think I'm giving away anything significant here). I kept asking myself why a man like Charlo would take no for an answer, it seemed so out of character for him to disappear into the night. I found myself wishing that Doyle had written an earlier scene that showed why he would behave this way when bullied----particularly given what we know about abusive husbands/fathers.In any case, I highly recommend this book and will add Doyle to my favorite authors list."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This novel is Roddy Doyle at his finest. The story is about a woman who is consistentlyemotionally and then physically abused by her spouse. She turns to alcohol in order todeny the extreme horror of her situation. She appears to be a classic victim of learnedhelplessness until he does something that forces her to act.This is a sad and tragic book. One hopes throughout the book that she will have thestrength to leave her monster of a husband. Does she or doesn't she. Only reading thebook will give you the answer."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"This is an interesting and surprisingly fast-paced read. And it certainly has a clear, and very distinctly Irish voice. The entire novel really paints a portrait of this woman, Paula Spencer. It feels like Roddy Doyle had seen a photograph of this scarred, missing-toothed cleaning woman, who has somehow retained a sense of beauty - either past or present and then managed to capture her story. I guess that's what the entire book felt like to me - a photograph, but more than that - a window into someone's soul.I am very interested in reading the sequel,Paula Spencer, since it doesn't seem like a sequel would be necessary by the end of it. There were, of course, unanswered questions - why did Carmel hate her father so? What happened to Paula's older son? And perhaps those are the types of questions that will be addressed in the sequel... Either way, I am excited to find out!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"In 1994, while my husband and I were living in England, I happened to watch a multi-part television program written by Roddy Doyle about Charlo and Paula Spencer and their family. I don't recall the title, but the program obviously was the inspiration for this book. The TV production was riveting, so I was excited to find this book, partly to see if it would follow a similar storyline, which it does (although in much more depth). As I read the book, I couldn't help but picture the faces of the actors who portrayed Paula, Charlo and Nicola. I believe the TV show was a BBC production, so it might be possible to find it on video somewhere. It would definitely be a valuable companion to the book."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Paula is 39, an Irish widow with children, who sits at the table and recounts her life story. And what an ugly story it is. After an upbringing in a not very supportive family and an unsuccessful education, she meets and marries Charlo when she is still really a child. In the beginning Charlo is very charming, but you feel danger lurking in the background all the time. And then the beatings start, which rise in frequency and severity, but every time she finds a reason to forgive the man she still loves and (in her opinion) depends on. Until she sees him looking at their oldest daughter with this special, violent look...It is book that made me want to cry for Paula when you could almost feel her bones breaking, cry out to Paula to DO something. When she finally takes her life into her own hands, a great feeling a relief washed over me. So a big compliment for Roddy Doyle."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I absolutely loved this book and would highly recommended it to anyone. I find myself walking around quoting from the book key lines. &quot;Ask me, Ask me&quot;. It was extraordinary how Mr. Doyle wrote the book from a female point of view."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Roddy Doyle has proven himself once again. The character, Paula, was so very real and moving I was unable to put this book down. With such vivid images and powerful wording, The woman who walked into doors will go down as one of my favourite and most read books."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Doyle's strength in 'Woman' is in showing the healing power of memories. Almost Freudian in its use of flashbacks particularly, the novel uses the mind of the wife-abused Paula Spencer as she uses her memories as medicine and bandages for her painful present. The reward is that Paula does survive in the end, but her hearing loss, her aching joints caused by broken bones, and her scars will always remind her that sometimes pain is just a person away. Whether Doyle can write in a woman's voice or not, his theme is genderless when he speaks to the power of the mind to heal the body and life itself. Having a cause for healing makes all the difference. Congratulations, Mr. Doyle."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"By far, the greatest accomplishment in this book is Doyle's first person narration as a female. I've read a few other books that attempt this, but Doyle is the only one to actually pull it off. Simply put, he wrote the book as a woman would. Paula's feelings were exactly how I would feel; one major accomplishment was Doyle's ability to pull off a very believable sexual encounter from Paula's point of view.The prose is terse and to the point, which makes it a fast read. I honestly couldn't put it down, and that is something I almost never say about a book considered to be actual \\"literature.\\""},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Roddy Doyle's book, The Woman Who Walked Into Doors was gripping. As Doyle shows the abuse cycle that occurs in a victim's life, the reader experiences all of the same emotions and experiences that the lead character, Paula Spencer, feels. Doyle gives incredible insight into a woman's mind and heart in his powerful book. He handles a delicate and controversial subject sensitively. Doyle does an excellent job of explaining the abuse cycle by showing how it works. Paula's father was an abusive man who beat and mentally scarred Paula's eldest sister. Paula's teachers and her younger brother sexually assaulted her and she subsequently married Charlo, an abusive man who degraded her, beat her until she couldn't walk, and raped her. \\"I closed my eyes. He kicked my back. Again. My back. My back. My back. The same spot again and again. He was breaking through my back.\\" From the abuse from her husband Paula felt as though she was nothing and couldn't leave him because she and her children would die without his support. They were nothing. Paula then began abusing herself. She became an alcoholic to deal with her pain. In the end, she beat her husband and kicked him out. Doyle shows the reader everything that happens to Paula during her life. The book is more than an abuse story; it is a life story. The reader feels what Paula goes through. You feel her pain, her terror, and her sadness when she sees that no one cares what happens to her. Doyle makes the reader care about Paula and what happens to her. We share every moment and every feeling. Doyle captures Paula's vulnerability when she wanted to be saved but was too scared to say anything and when Paula shares that she lost a baby to Charlo's beatings. \\"The baby was gone before I knew if it was a boy or a girl. Between Leanne and Jack. Born too early; born by a fist. A girl. I never saw her. Her name is Sally.\\" In Roddy Doyle created an excellent account of domestic abuse. The explanation he gave of abuse and the intimacy with his main character, Paula made for an emotional and moving read. The Woman Who Walked Into Doors was a well-written, gripping book that holds onto you until the last page."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Mr. Roddy Doyle is a brilliant writer, however his work, &quot;The Woman Who Walked Into Doors&quot;, is exceptional even for him. The majority of this work is written as a monologue recounting a 17 year marriage, however the voice is that of a woman, and for Mr. Doyle it demonstrates yet again how incredibly talented a writer he is.You will find this work funny if you find sociopaths amusing. You will find it sexy if violence and rape are entertaining. There is a difference between dark humor and, &quot;the smile of a Nazi&quot;. If a joke or two resides in a book it does not qualify as a comedy, and if there is a memory or two of young love that can be called fond, it does not qualify as sexy. If a child is holding an ice cream cone and the contents fall to the ground, the look on the child's face can be called sad. When the question of, &quot;left or right&quot;, is not a choice of streets rather the side that sadistic cruelty is inflicted upon the person who is asked, to be judged sad is to read the judgment of an imbecile.This book is as good as anything this writer has offered to readers, and is by far the darkest work of his I have read. To state this is a book about an abusive relationship is to qualify for making an understatement of epic magnitude. This book is as brutal to read, as the savagery committed within it is an everyday occurrence around the world. Even when a type of justice of finality is visited upon the sadist in this book it is for yet other actions of his.I really thought I was beyond being upset by anything I would read. Mindless violence while a daily event is hardly surprising. Behavior that manages to disturb due to a writer's ability to truly deliver the pain, insanity, and premeditated cruelty is as important as the crimes committed are repulsive. That which Mr. Doyle writes about is common, that he is able to present what we have become numb to in a manner that is profoundly disturbing is extraordinary."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Writing a story from the point of view of a battered woman is a bit like getting a head start in a race. Before you've even begun you've virtually got the entire audience already on your side, united and standing by this poor abused female. To do a mediocre job about a subject like this isn't terribly difficult purely based on the amount of emotional baggage that the reader is going to bring to the book. But to produce a story in such a fantastic and astonishing way as is done here is breathtaking. Roddy Doyle doesn't take the easy way out of anything. The story is shockingly real and the characters are vividly brought to life. The detail and the feelings are so intense that if one didn't know better, one would swear that this is genuinely the autobiographical story of a woman coming to the end of what she can take. There were passages in here that I was physically uncomfortable reading, purely from the power of the writing and the intensity of the raw emotion.The focus of Doyle's story is a fairly unremarkable housewife in contemporary Dublin who has the unexciting name of Paula Spencer. On the surface, Paula's not a terribly interesting person. She lives in an ordinary neighborhood, has a nostalgic regard for her childhood, and does the same normal things that thousands of other women her age do. You probably know her, or someone quite like her. As we learn more about Paula, as the layers get pulled back, we begin to see that there is more going on in her life than we initially suspected. And, yet, nothing that we learn, by itself, is especially shocking given the world that we live in today. Alcoholism, spousal abuse, and violence are unfortunately a part of life, so it's not the inclusion of those elements that lifts this book out of the ordinary. Where the book succeeds is in painting a shockingly realistic portrayal of a relatively unassuming wife who has gotten herself trapped in a violent and abusive relationship.We begin the book by seeing her the way she is seen by the people in her life who don't want to know what her real problems are. But the author doesn't let us stay on the surface for long. As we delve deeper and deeper into this woman's mind, the things we learn become more and more unsettling. Nothing is brought out merely for shock value, and nothing is brought out just for show. The reactions and attitudes of the woman are utterly and painfully real, while the actions themselves are explored in a deep and unsettling manner. They way that Paula tries to cope with her situation is disturbingly realistic, allowing Doyle to really get to the heart of matters. Paula's mindset is held up to the light for the audience to see the good, the bad, and the ugly. The book is a powerful character study.What keeps people in abusive and destructive relationships is something that is oftentimes a complete mystery to outsiders. THE WOMAN WHO WALKED INTO DOORS tells this story from deep in the point of view of the victim. The title of this book is, of course, a euphamism. It's what Paula and thousands of women like her say to their friends to cover their black-eyes and bloodied, broken noses. But it's telling in another way; Paula walks into the door, rather than through it, being unable escape the cycle of violence. This book won't preach at you, but it may help you to understand exactly what is going through the head of a woman who keeps getting hit, but never seems to leave. It's not a non-stop downer though, as Paula's narrative voice can be quite amusing at places. However, it's her story that you'll remember long after reading this book, not the (admittedly funny) asides that she often makes."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Written in 1996, this \\"prequel\\" to 2007's Paula Spencer, tells of Paula's life from her teen years to her passionate relationship with Charlo Spencer. Part of a family of robbers, Charlo is an exciting man who makes her feel alive and gives her a sense of selfhood. Booker Prize-winner Doyle crafts a dramatic first-person narrative told by Paula, who leaves her rigid home and unsympathetic father to marry Charlo, a man her father disapproves of. Their passionate relationship and remarkable sense of communication vanish when Paula becomes pregnant with the first of their four children. Gradually, Paula finds solace in alcohol, as Charlo becomes an absentee husband and father and eventually a philandering wife-abuser.Paula begins her story in the present, with Charlo's death--shot by the police after he has murdered a woman during a robbery--then develops the story through her reminiscences about both the good and the bad times. As she relives her courtship and early marriage and explores her early past and her more recent past,, she also tells us about her present battle with alcohol. She regrets that Nicola, her teenage daughter is responsible for the family on many occasions, since Paula works nights cleaning offices and then returns home wanting only to tell Jack a bedtime story and then abandon herself to drink.As the story of her abuse evolves, the reader is privy to Paula's innermost conflicts. Though she knows that \\"I lost all my friends--and most of my teeth,\\" she also bemoans the fact that \\"he beat me brainless and I felt guilty.\\" The tendency of abuse victims to blame themselves, especially when their love has been as great as that of Paula and Charlo, explains Paula's comment that \\"for seventeen years I was brainwashed and brain dead.\\" She knows that she has made her children suffer, not only because of her abuse but because of her alcoholism, but she has been powerless to change until in one violent moment, she sends Charlo out of the house and determines to live her life on her own.Doyle's ability to structure a novel such as this one, which moves from immediate present into recent and then distant past, providing important information about character in the process, brings this dramatic novel to life. His trademark humor is subdued here in favor of the ironies of Paula's life. This is a far more serious novel than the Barrytown Trilogy--more in keeping with the Booker Prize-winning _Paddy Clark, Ha, Ha, Ha_, an equally sad story of a deteriorating marriage from the point of view of a ten-year-old boy. This poignant novel is ultimately a celebration of the human spirit as Paula determines to take control of her life and to provide a family for her children. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I'd seen the movies made from Doyle's earlier books (The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van), but hadn't read any until this. Despite the somewhat depressing tale it's great writing. The book is the recounting by a 39-year old Irish woman of her family and social life growing up, interspersed with her life now, a year after the death of her abusive husband. Told first-person, as if she is sitting at a kitchen table with the reader, the stories of her life are engrossing and entertaining. Although the actual battering doesn't come until the last third of the book, it lurks in the background of everything leading up to it. And when it does come, it dominates and is terrible in its harshness. It's a pretty impressive story, especially coming from the pen of a man."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"THE WOMAN WHO WALKED INTO DOORS by Roddy Doyle is a book I had a hard time putting down because it pulled me intensively into the story .Doyle writes about an alcoholic woman whose husband abuses her constantly. Not only the story itself, but also the style and the composition of his book are extremely violent. Doyle for instance uses the language of the social area he describes. Some readers might be shocked by the rough, colloquial language his characters use, but they have to keep in mind that it helps to authenticate the setting. His frequent use of dialogue gives the reader a sense of being present in the environment describes. Also, there is no chronological development in the story. The book starts with the end of the actual story and ends in the middle of it. Past and present keep intermingling through the use of flashbacks. The way the story is told reminded me of how our own memory works: events and feelings are randomly thrown together, but to find out how something really happened you must sort everything out. To me, Doyle's highest achievement is the perspective from which the story is told. Doyle, as a man, tried to put himself into a woman's body and soul. I think he succeeded extremely well. Rarely did I, as a female reader, find stereotypical allusions of which I believe some men might be convinced. As can be seen in his earlier books(cf PADDY CLARK HA HA HA or THE SNAPPER), Doyle seems to have a real gift for slipping into characters that have nothing in common with himself. Readers who like to reflect on society will be all the more pleasedthat Doyle's central issue continues to be Irish working class. Some British readers might have seen his TV series FAMILY on BBC that was controversial, because it dealt with family taboos such as abuse, alcoholism, and poverty. Have fun with some real good literature!"},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"How do you write a novel about wife-battering without making the batterer a monster? How do you write one while making sure the reader cannot blame the victim for staying? Well, perhaps the first is impossible, but the second surely isn't, and this book is proof.Doyle takes us inside the head of Paula, who has found out that her deadbeat husband is now dead. There are hints that she might have had to something to do with his demise, but it's not clearly drawn out until we have learned how horrible he has made this woman's life. Why doesn't she leave, some may ask? Well, she's poor, not well-educated, and has grown up in a family and neighborhood where abuse stays behind closed doors. However, her struggles first to survive her husband, and then to survive the memories are moving and poignant.Doyle also lets us the effects of abuse on the children, who have witnessed it, and how the whole family can act in accordance to keep the unsavory behavior of one of their own a secret. While Paula considers herself weak and just muddling through, the reader will likely come to the opposite conclusion.Rather than go on Oprah and confess her problems, she keeps her struggles to herself (and the reader) and in doing so, comes across as incredibly brave, a heroine in every sense."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I read it in a day. The theme is old, sometimes overdone, yet I found myself unable to part from Paula Spencer. The narrative style of Roddy Doyle tells this story in a circular and timeless fashion. The story doesn't begin, the story doesn't end. It happens every where and all the time, yet Paula feels that she is the only person to suffer her fate. She feels that she deserves it, that she has provoked it. She grasps at any sense of healing she can find. Yet she barely notices it in front of her own face, inside her family. Doyle's story telling techniques didn't let me down. He remarkably captures an extremely colloquial working class. He uses vocabulary to suit the less educated, the &quot;thicks&quot;. He explains things perfectly as some one in Paula's position would. Doyle's couragous use of repetition was outstanding! He constantly re-uses scenes and slowly builds to an expanisive understanding of Paula's life. We being to realize things alongside Paula. And we understand that if one remembers the good-they must also remember the bad. Comparably-to remember the bad, we also take with us the good. With out hitting readers (or the main character) over the head, Doyle has explained to us why some people allow such terrible things to happen to themselves. He tells us, and he tells us again. He is teaching us to see. He wants us to &quot;ask&quot; those people, and offer them the help they want. He shows us that when all else fails--we have our family."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I borrowed this book from my sister-in-law while visiting family in Ireland. I'd never read Roddy Doyle before, but I certainly will again. The book is terribly dark, and you find yourself feeling this doomed woman's every breath. This is not a book for readers who only like happy stories. This is, however, a painfully realistic view of poverty, alcoholism and violence. What I found most interesting was the way in which the narrator would repeat her thoughts over and over again, word for word. I liked that because it seemed so human...especially after a lifetime of being broken down. She would remember things as though it were for the first time, mainly because they are as vivid and painful still. I really connected with her, and any book that can do that is amazing. I strongly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the dark side of literature."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I read part of The Woman Who Walked Into Doors maybe 18 months ago in the New Yorker. At the time all I thought was &quot;Yeehaa! A new Roddy Doyle!&quot; It's safe to say that I would read his shopping list and probably be enthralled. I thought it was an enormously well-written book in that the writing and writer were indetectable and all there was was Paula and her story. It's heartbreaking to read about this bright happy girl who one day discovers that she's &quot;thick&quot; after being put in the dumb-kid class at school. And from then on her life, and those of her friends, schoolmates and sisters revolve around men. The way men treat them, the way they are either a &quot;slut&quot; or a &quot;tight bitch&quot;. The way they only become someone or make a name for themselves in relation to men. The worst part though is how much she did love Charlo before he began to beat her. It would have been more bearable if she'd just married the first thick that knocked her up. But that this man that she loved, and that genuinely loved her would destroy her like that was horrible. This book really affected me. I felt almost as though I'd lived it through it all myself. Very moving, very sad."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"I write book review part-time, and have done so for the past six years. This is simply the best, and certainly the most important, novel I've reviewed in all that time. Mr. Doyle's skill in expressing the mental and physical suffering of a battered wife will take your breath away. If you have not yet read this unforgettable novel, put it in your shopping cart right now. You can thank me later. What you'll get is a literary experience that will remain with you for years to come."},{"Title":"Woman Who Walked Into Doors","review":"Paula Spencer in Roddy Doyle's \\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\" spends much of the book telling the story of her life, initiated by the death of her estranged husband. There is a profoundness to her sadness recalling the courtship she had with Charlo and the life they lived as a couple and as parents. She slowly realizes why her life came about as it has (single, alcoholic, poor), why Charlo's life ended the way it did. Paula spent her life making excuses for why Charlo did the things he did, always letting herself be convinced that Charlo truly loved her despite the horrible beating he inflicted on the the mother of his children. Not until she is able to stand up and take matters into her own hands does her life begin to straighten out.Doyle's writing is sinply magnificent. Writing from the perspective of this alcoholic high-school dropout, he keeps her words as would be expected from someone of her educational background. The way he is able to write from a woman's perspective is remarkable. Paula's struggle with her alcoholism seems very real and probably all too familiar to those who have decided they can quit drinking any time they want.While this book is not one to read if you expect to have a bit of light reading, it is time well spent."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This book does its best, but in the end suffers from something that I think is inherent in the material itself. I did learn a little more about quantum theory from this book, but not much more than I already knew to begin with. And this book didn't really make many of the main concepts any clearer. I don't think is the author's fault, I think it's almost impossible to try to explain these things. Most of the problem, (and similar statements go for cosmology, cryptography, etc.) is that it's almost impossible to explain concepts whose fundamental expression is mathematical language without using mathematics. What inevitably results is some kind of vague, touchy-feely idea of what's meant, but little understanding. And I say this as a mathematician.To give just one example, at one point in the book, the author talks about &quot;probability amplitudes&quot;, for several pages. The only problem is, he never says what this term is supposed to mean, but he does mention that complex numbers are involved, and other facts. The result after this happens several times is that the reader starts to read entire paragraphs consisting of terminology that's never been defined clearly. The word &quot;operator&quot; is the best example here. It's fine to talk ABOUT operators in indirect, oblique language, but really you don't have a true understanding of what that word means unless you know its precise mathematical definition, or unless you have a clear understanding of the notion of vector space (axiomatically, not &quot;stuff you can add together&quot;). I didn't have this kind of problem with most of the mathematical terminology, because I know it, but the problem comes with the physics -- the physics concepts are essentially mathematical, and trying to explain them without using mathematics is like trying to understand Shakespeare without being able to read English -- you can always give a vague, hazy account, but not much more.The book is well-written (aside from an overly-biased presentation of the philosophical aspects), but I think it tries to have its cake and eat it too. It says it's free of mathematics, but this isn't really the case. The whole text is fully of talk about operators, vectors, vector spaces, equations, probability theory, and so on. It's the _symbolism_, not the math, that's missing (except for the appendix, which thoroughly confused me, mainly because terms were introduced without precise definition, and the notation was the physicist's notation, not mathematician's notation...)This book was confusing to me, but the reason was because it had too LITTLE math, not too much."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This pocket-sized, 92-page text--113 pages with appendices and index--professes to be a \\"very short introduction\\" to an understanding of quantum theory, to the unseen world that's so many millions of times smaller than even atoms.It's not at all a bad summary of the field of quantum mechanics, written fairly lucidly, concisely, and with interest, but I'd have to say it's lacking as an introduction to the subject, in that it really does assume its readers are intelligent people with something of a science background. Do not buy this expecting it to be QUANTUM THEORY FOR DUMMIES, because it's still fairly dense and heavy, and not written as clearly or as startlingly as much of Stephen Hawking's stuff. To some readers, this assumption of their intelligence may be refreshing, and it is to a degree, but with a subject as complex and bizarre as quantum mechanics, most non-scientists will need as much help as they can get, help not necessarily to be found in here.I do have to say, though, that this is a book worth reading, and, then, re-reading. After I read it, I went back through and looked up a few of the more major concepts--quantum entanglement, in which two particles that interact will continue to affect each other no matter how far apart they're separated; Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat and the idea of a state between life and death, between here and there, between being and non-being; Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and how you can't have a knowledge of both position and momentum of a particle; et cetera--and just that brief re-reading was a huge help to me.The book will teach you a lot about the subject, and will give you a good start toward further educating your knowledge of this awesome and frustrating topic, this topic which has already done so much toward unlocking the secrets of our existence and our universe--and toward confusing everyone.Its glossary is lacking, its author has a subtle but evident Christian bias, but overall it's a good little book, and I enjoyed it. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This is a short book, and that is its only advantage, unfortunately.Granted, that the author is eminent in this field and was himself a student of the great Paul Dirac. However, this book does not sit easily in a series designed to make a subject approachable to the novice. It has far too much esoteric maths than is good for a book of this genre. An ever stronger criticism is the fact that instead of keeping to basic physics ideas such as the double slit experiment (which this book does well!) and then developing the ideas of atomic structure, and the uncertainty principle, it dwells on things like operators and such like.If you want a good introduction to Quantum Theory, look no further than the books by George Gamow's &quot;The New World of Mr Tompkins&quot; or &quot;Mr Tomkins in paperback&quot;, or, &quot;Uncle Albert and the Quantum Quest&quot;."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"In an introduction to a topic, one expects lots of figures to explain just about every topic. This book, and indeed the entire series, generally has rather few figures. The series also, generally, focuses on the historical development of the topic and not necessarily on the current understanding of the topic. Therefore, the series sacrifices a better explanation of our current understanding to explain who thought what and when. Nonetheless, this book serves adequately in the capacity of a \\"very short introduction.\\""},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"There are few things more beautiful to me than a profound, concise, respectable and rigorous small book. The gift of knowledge and time such a book provides matches is profound. \\"Quantum Theory, A Very Short Introduction\\" achieves this beauty nicely.Looking at the small book, and my current desire to understand the essence of the mystery of Quantum physics, I had a strange desire starting the book- I wanted it to hurt a little bit. That is to say, I wanted it to be challenging enough to reach a profound depth and truth that matched my desire to know. And I wanted it to be real- not a fanciful tour of \\"cool stuff\\" but a book so steeped in knowledge that it exposes the diamond at the center of this leviathan. I wanted to be challenged, and maybe read a page two or three times to capture the occasional key point. I wanted a book by an author so knowledgeable that he would be brave enough to tackle this goal in a 100 page book. In other words, I wanted the truth, I wanted it quickly, and, as a result, I expected to sweat. I wasn't disappointed.This book is part of an Oxford University Press series of \\"Very Short Introductions\\". The format of the books in this series is about 100 pages, in a small paperback size. The text is fairly small, with small margins, with maybe 300 words per page. That makes each books about 30 000 words, plus of minus 25% for pictures, paragraph size and so on. And the books are written by experts with a professional level of rigor. The are a very short, deep, and real introductions. They make you sweat a little.My dream is to read the other hundred or so publications in the series. Probably not all of them, but a significant number. I'm at about six so far."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"It's a difficult subject, but this is an excellent overview that will help get you grounded in some of the basic ideas of quantum theory. This can't be the only book you read on the subject, but it's a great start."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I liked this book, but it is hard to see who it was written for. The book, in keeping with the others in this series, is short (about 100-pages) and it surely is an introduction to the subject. It covers all of quantum theory, from its beginnings in 1900 to present day problems and herein lies its strengths and weaknesses. It provides a nice overview, with no math (except for 10 pages of appendices), so it was obviously meant for a general audience. However, it does not cover quantum theory in an elementary manner - suitable for a high school student. While the text does not use mathematics, per se, it does use many mathematical terms, such as eingenvector, eigenvalue and superposition principle, which are discussed in the appendices, but in my opinion not clearly enough for someone without sufficient math or physics background. In addition to the basic subjects, such as the Bohr atom, matrix and wave mechanics; the book also covers more esoteric subjects such as quantum logic, relativistic quantum theory and quantum field theory. The general audience may be able to grasp the basic subjects but I suspect that, given the terse explanations that are provided, they will have a lot more problems with the more esoteric subjects, and sentences like \\" Putting it in learned language, the EPR effect is ontological and not simply epistemological.\\" do not help. Fortunately, the author then goes on to a more understandable discussion, but I found the complexity of the sentence that I just quoted (and many other similar ones) to be completely out of place in a book that aims at being an introduction to this or any other subject.This book suffers in comparison to the rest of the books in the \\"short introduction\\" series that I have read. I thought that the others were 5-stars, but I would rate this one 4-stars, at best. My biggest problem is for whom do I recommend this book. I am afraid that it is to complex for someone who has no background in the subject and those with the background may find the discussions too brief and cursory. I have read a lot in this area, so I have some of the necessary background, but I am far from an expert for whom this book would be somewhat sketchy, so the book was fine for me. I would rate this book as 3.5 stars, down rating it because I do not think that it is a very good fit for most readers and because it is unnecessarily complex in spots, but since fractional stars are not allowed I am going with 4-stars, but others will likely rate it lower."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Let me preface this with the fact that I am neither a physicist or a mathematician. I did have to take countless hours of statistics in my many years of college but that was no help in understanding this book.I really purchased this book as I understood it to be written for the layman to give him an overall understanding of what Quantum Mechantics is about, what makes it special, and what it has accomplished.Alas, after reading the book the above three questions are still unanswered. I may read it again as it is a tiny book but it is not the most enjoyable book to read (unlike Hawkins \\"A Brief History of Time\\" which was a great read). The author's explanations seem very unclear and he never quite gets to the point! In the preface to his book the author makes two very bold statements that in effect says that Quantum theory is the greatest intellectual achievement of the 20th century and that Quantum Theory has been \\"fantastically fruitful\\" during it's 75 years of \\"exploitation\\". Oh, really, would you care to elaborate on that please? This sets the tone for the whole book. He makes a vague statement about this accomplishment or that accomplishment throughout the book then just drops it without ever giving you a concise, clear cut example. I felt like someone at a cake bake whom is repeatedly told how great everything tastes but is never allowed to taste it himselfThe author quotes a statement of Richard Feynman (a famous Quantum mechanics physicist) in which Richard says \\"I think I can safely say no one understands quantum mechanics.\\" Well I think he must be right because I believe that if the author truly understood quantum mechanics he could certainly convey it's essence more clearly.P.S.

The history and growth of the subject is treated along with the physics and presented in an easily digested form. The physics itself demands an uncoupling of the mind from everyday experiences and common knowledge, a point the author raises in his last chapter. All in all I found the book useful as a base on which to launch a deeper look into the subject. Definitely recommend it to anyone who needs some basic knowledge on quantum physics.

Problem with book and most of science books in this series is that they need to be updated"},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"The author of this little monograph, John Polkinghorne KBE FRS, was the Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge University for a decade before 1979 when he resigned to study to become an Anglican priest. In his many books he has made a special study of the relationship between science and religion and is one of the recipients of the Templeton Prize that is awarded for illumination of the spiritual dimension of being.This is not the simplest or most absorbing book on the subject I have read. I found Frank Close's monograph in the same series, entitled Particle Physics, more absorbing and easier to read. Chapter 2 for example introduces us to matrix mechanics and eigenvectors. There's nothing really scary here and most of the maths is in an Appendix but just the terms are likely to deter non-mathematicians a touch I think. No-one other than mathematics graduates will make anything of the Hamiltonians and partial derivatives in another Appendix.But the text itself is readable and informative, and it includes subjects like consciousness and Gamow tunnelling and explains the role of such luminaries as Max Born and Paul Dirac. Each subject is dealt with in small, bite-sized pieces, each of which is reasonably self-contained; so it is not necessary to tackle all of the more challenging ideas in order to extract information from the later portions. In Chapter 3 the author says: \`At most times and in most places, the universe has been devoid of consciousness'. That's a surprising statement for a priest to make. It has certainly been devoid of human consciousness but I would have expected a priest to maintain that the consciousness of God was present eternally.The book explains simply for non-scientists some of the incredible consequences of the ideas that underpin quantum physics and explains the common terms. It would therefore make an excellent introductory volume for undergraduates in physics or chemistry, but this is not 'Quantum Theory for Beginners'! The approach is holistic and spiritual, which is entirely appropriate, following on from the ideas of Fritjof Capra's Tao of Physics and the fact that Polkinghorne is now a priest.

It occurred to me that I could write a review saying that Page 15 is missing (as a joke):-)"},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I'm thoroughly unimpressed by Rev. Polkinghorne's account of quantum physics. Even though he is technically competent, Polkinghorne seems to get every major interpretation wrong. For example, he thinks Bohr in error to consider free will and determinism complementary. But Bohr's colleague and Nobel Laureate Max Born did say that Bohr's complementarity applies precisely to this situation.Right on page 1 Polkinghorne shows his tendency to misunderstand. Speaking of Laplace's conjecture, the physicist-turned-Anglican priest writes \\"In fact, this rather chilling mechanistic claim always had a strong suspicion of hubris about it. For one thing, human beings do not experience themselves as being clockwork automata....\\"This is like accusing someone of arrogrance because he said \\"If I were the president of the United States I would eliminate poverty...\\" He did say \\"If,\\" didn't he? Laplace always said this prediction of the future is only possible in principle, but impossible in practice. In fact, in making his \\"thought experiment\\" - not a factual \\"claim,\\" as Polkinghorne thinks - he made two assumptions which he knew to be UNTRUE. First, that such an ideal intelligence exists. (When Napoleon asked him about the Creator after reading his theory of the solar system, Laplace gave this magnificent reply: \\"Sire, I have no need for that hypothesis.\\") And second, that this intelligence can analyse absolutely all data at once.As for what humans \\"experience,\\" the fact is that not even a frog feels like a clockwork automatum. But what we feel is irrelevant if our belief in free will is due to the unpredictability of our volition, and this unpredictability is due in to deterministic chaos, which leaves no room for free will at all, no matter how irregular we might feel. In fact, no machine can perfectly understand another machine of exactly the same level of complexity, even without chaos added to the difficulty. A machine may be able to understand another of lower level of complexity. The same goes for humans: We may always have difficult understanding ourselves although we may eventually understand simpler organisms. We humans have enough trouble understanding the nervous system of something as simple as a dog. What Polkinghorne should have asked is: What would be the effect of quantum mechanics on this \\"thought experiment\\" of Laplace? An honest answer would be: None. Indeed, Laplace did not need chaos or quantum uncertainty to know that his conjecture is no more than just a thought experiment, though a very worthwhile and instructive one.Polkinghorne puts down other physicists (and auto mechanics in general) by saying \\"The average quantum mechanic is no more philosophical than the average auto mechanic.\\" Born, however, said that theoretical physics IS actually philosophy. Bohr always said that there are important epistemological lessons to be drawn from the world of physics, especially elementary particle physics. It's as though Polkinghorne has been asleep through all the major developments of the past century. On the few occasions he is awake, he misunderstands and misrepresents. Polkinghorne himself may be no more philosophical than an auto mechanic (maybe even less so), but don't drag people like Schroedinger, Bohr, Born, Pauli, Heisenberg, Wheeler, Bell and Weinberg through the mud with such silly statements."},{"Title":"Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Polkinghorne is a stalwart in the long tradition of academic egocentricity.

It deals with the issues of sexuality, race, friendship, marriage, AIDS and many others. Kushner developes the characters by putting them in different situations to see how they will deal with the problem. For example, the character of Joe is in a marriage with an unstable woman. He knows in his heart that he is gay, but he does not want to leave her. He has to struggle with this decision amongst other problems that people dump on him throughout the play. In the end he evolves and begins to overcome his problems. The other characters in the play also have issues to deal with. The play is very funny and also has a moral twist. I feel that Kushner's plan was to make the reader see how indecent the world is about serious issues. The play deals with moral issues and politcal issues in America. I think the play shows how the self evolves with life experiences. Kushners writes a very magical play that deals with very real issues.

However, the most important theme of the play reaches beyond those topics. Kushner places emphasis on issues, such as discrimination and corruption, yet I found greater meaning in the play when I looked past those issues that Kushner raised.Kushner depicts America as a country that focuses on images based on stereotypes and preconceived ideas that often have little experiential founding. Americans use those images as a framework for dealing with their everyday activities and encounters. This idea is not that shocking if you assume that Kushner means that Americans impose those images upon other people. Although he does portray that meaning, Kushner takes the imposition of those images a step further by showing through his characters that individuals also have stereotypes and preconceived ideas that they inflict upon themselves. While everyone needs an image of him or her self in order to function, they deny a part of themselves by embracing that image. Kushner shows how life is about struggling with the image we have of ourselves in order to have richer and more fulfilling experiences. We are constantly discovering aspects of the images that we have of ourselves that are false as well as becoming comfortable with those aspects that we find are true. The character Prior reveals that this process of self-discovery is an infinite journey on which people thrive. The journey may be full of pain and tragedy, but it also bears the fruit of revelation and understanding. For me, this lesson about humanity is what makes the play a respectable and praiseworthy piece of work."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"I am 100% satisfied with this purchase.

The two parts of theplay (subtitled &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and&quot;Perestroika&quot;) together represent a passionate andintelligent exploration of American life during the era of PresidentRonald Reagan. Kushner peoples his play with individuals who are forthe most part &quot;marginal&quot; in some way in U.S. culture. Hischaracters include Mormons, gay men, men with AIDS, Jews, a drugaddict, and an African-American drag queen. These various perspectivesand voices allow Kushner to create some fascinating dialogues aboutthe &quot;American dream&quot;--and about the nightmares that can goalong with it.Kushner's cast of characters is excellently drawn, butperhaps his most astounding creation is influential lawyer Roy Cohn, afictionalized version of a real historical figure. A gay Jew who ishimself viciously homophobic, Kushner's Cohn is grotesque, hilarious,frightening, and seductive all at once. This character allows Kushnerto make fascinating statements about power, politics, and sexualidentity.Also brilliant is Kushner's use of Mormonism and itstheology as an integral component of the play. Kushner is the firstliterary artist I know of who has used Mormon themes and motifs insuch a consistently compelling and intelligent way. Kushner is, in myopinion, neither a proselytizer for nor a basher of Mormonism, but hispresentation of troubled Mormon characters and his apparent satirizingof some aspects of Mormon theology both strike me as potentiallycontroversial. Because Mormonism is a religion founded in the U.S.,this aspect of Kushner's play accentuates the essential&quot;American-ness&quot; of the piece.Kushner achieves a stunningblend of politically charged realism and fantastic, even playfulmysticism in &quot;Angels.&quot; His writing is sharp and cutting attimes, and elsewhere tender and haunting. And the play is often quitefunny. Although the action of the play focuses on the Reagan era,&quot;Angels&quot; often takes in a much larger sweep of U.S., andeven world, history.&quot;Angels in America&quot; is a fascinatingmeditation on power and its abuse, on disease and healing, on honestyto oneself and to others, and on pluralism and bigotry. A masterpieceof 20th century literature, this is a play to be seen. But whether ornot you have seen it, it is also a work to be read and pondered."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"With ANGELS, Tony Kushner has accomplished what only a rare few Western writers have managed to do. Integrating biblical knowledge, classical history, myth, poetry and a vast understanding of the human heart in all of its best and worst guises, these plays illuminate with the blinding fire of the angel at its core, the great hypocrisies which lay just beneath the surface of our nation. Like Howard Zinn, and to some extent Studs Terkel, Kushner recognizes that we are not one nation under God. Instead, we seem to be a huge, selfish and confused hoarde attepting to move forward in time with primary moral references to the oldest, and in some ways, least applicable documents and sources of wisdom. Whether one believes that God is \\"dead\\" or not, I cannot imagine another work of literature which might promote a more useful theological discussion between so-called liberals and conservatives. Add to this the fact that the stories and characterization are gripping, the heroes are truly admirable and the villains reprehensible. Humans change in profound and permanent ways, and amid the pain of our time, there is -- after a reading of these remarkable plays -- still hope. For once in many years, the Pulitzer Prize moved in the right direction. Whether read or viewed on stage or in its most recent iteration as a superb HBO movie, ANGELS is one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"I've never read a book that has left me with the shocking impact that 'Angels in America' has left me. At first I felt that the book was very confusing with all of the characters, but once the storyline became clear to me, I was able to get into the heart of the matter. Tony Kushner really touches on a subject that affects today's society in an unforgettable way that no other writer has been able to do. His identification with AIDS is profound, although the book takes place at a time when AIDS was still unknown and misunderstood. Today's society may be more accepting of people's different lifestyles, but there is still a division in our beliefs and opinions. Kushner has helped me to believe that just because you are different doesn't mean you are not a human being. It's what's inside of the person that matters the most. It's what the person has to give to others that makes them human beings. Kushner's characters all have a unique personality about them; they are all different. But in the end we find that every person in the book have something in common, and that is what makes them become one in the end. It's what makes them all connected in the same way. Prior and Louis are two of the best characters in the book. Through them, all of the other characters become connected somehow by the end of the book. They all meet under strange circumstances, but it is those odd circumstances that make the book so spectacular. Roy is the most profound character that I have ever come across. He has an incurable disease that is taking his life, yet he remains in denial until the end leaving me with the question of whether the disease ever destroyed him or if he destroyed the disease. I think the two chracters, Joe and Harper, stand for what every person goes through some time in their lives. Our world is full of confusion and decisions, the hardest thing to do is keep yourself straight, so to speak, but Joe and Harper become the victims of an uncompassionate society; a society that abandons them. The issues revealed in this book are issues that most people want to hide from. No one wants to talk about politics, homosexuality, AIDS, or religion, and to combine all these issues in one book was a very bold stand Kushner took. Instead of denying all these issues or brushing them off, 'Angels in America' talks about them just like two guys talking about baseball. These issues were brought to the surface where they remained evident throughout the book wanting me to read more in the end. Although I felt the book was surprisingly full of language and explicit details, details I sometimes think should have been left to my imagination, I can't help but appreciate the truth that it provided for me by being so real and surprising. We live in a sheltered world where we want to shelter our children from all that can harm them, but in the end we don't realize that it is the sheltering that does the most damage to our youth. This book has taught me to never deny or abandon the beliefs I have grown up with or the things my parents have taught me, but at the same time, I should never abandon the person I have become."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"This is the best play I've ever read. Actually, it's the best \\"anything\\" that I've ever read. I think it could be the best play ever written. It's an amazing mixture of internal and external conflicts. It's a really good commentary on societal and personal relationships. It's a excellent illustration of the lengths that a person will go to, to preserve their reality, regardless of how dysfunctional their reality is. The known is safe, regardless of how bad it is. The characters are incredibly full and alive. As you read, you find yourself identifying with and relating to the characters and their experiences. This play brings out empathy in a way that I have never experienced before. I could read it over and over and not get bored with it. I think this should be a required public school reading text. I think that everyone could benefit from reading this play. If everyone were to read this play, I believe that the world would be a much different place than it is now. I'm a public school teacher. I would love to teach this play, but I know that the \\"powers that be\\" would never allow it. However, it doesn't hurt to dream. I am testimony to the fact that you do not have to be a homosexual to identify with this play. This play touches people at a human level. I truly believe that this play would be pertinent across cultural and sexual boundaries. I highly recommend that you read it."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"In this epic play, subtitled a Gay Fantasia on National Themes, we follow the lives of a small group of people struggling with AIDS, love, and the meaning of forgiveness. Prior Walter has AIDS, and his lover Louis leaves him because he cannot handle it. Prior is later visited by the Angel, who deems him a prophet, but of what? Louis meets Joe whose marriage is collapsing, and the two find solace in each other. Roy Cohn is one of the most powerful men in America, so he cannot have AIDS because that would be a sign of weakness. Instead, he has cancer. \\"Angels in America\\" is a fantastic meditation on love and politics in the beginning years of the AIDS crisis that still has relevance today with its message of greater love and acceptance."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"After reading Kushner's two-part play-write I was caught off guard by his use of drama and comedy with such a diverse group of people. He combines homosexual relationships with valium addicted Mormons with angelic visitations, and comes out with a masterpiece. Kushner holds nothing back when discussing some of societies' most important issues. At a time when AIDS, homosexuality, and drug addicts were on the rise Kushner brings these issues up close and personal through the character's lives. I was enlightened by Kushner's on point illustration of American society. This is a wake up call for all of those that think these issues do not exist. Kushner dug deep into some tragedies that can come out of these situations as well. You could almost feel the emotion of the dying AIDS victims and the lonely couple looking for love that is not there. I highly recommend this two-part masterpiece. I have not seen the on stage performance but from what I have read it is brilliant. Kushner put enough detail in the book to put you right there in the story. I cannot even imagine how wonderful the on stage performance must be. This is a work of art that I will never forget."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Before picking up this book I had already categorized and stereotyped the plot, characters, and anticipated my reaction. I visualized a sob story featuring homosexuals who are misunderstood by society, I pictured stereotypical gay men with high-pitched voices, I knew this story would not make my top-ten list. But I have never been more wrong or judgemental about anything I've ever read.Tony Kushner's &quot;Angels in America&quot; may be one of the most touching accounts depicting American society that i have ever been invited to read. Life is not &quot;sugar-coated&quot; in this play, rather the truth is plainly put out on the table for all to see. The characters in this play are close to the heart and teach us that only the truth will set us free. They are unlikely, yet fitting angels for our generation. We meet Prior, a lonely man dying of AIDS who is the epitome of truth, chosen to prophesize to the masses. Louis and Joe who are both so different yet the same, both realizing the power of the &quot;threshold of revelation&quot;. Roy, whose deceptiveness is the cause of his undoing, and Harper who is trapped in a world where the truth has no existence. Yet all of their lives are interconnected by a desire to make sense of the world around them.Amidst politics and controversy, high drama and comedic relief the characters remaining at the play's end have determined a better sense of self and what it means to be &quot;real&quot;. I walked away from Kushner's &quot;Angels&quot; with a better sense of my own self and a more open mind. It was written with a compassion and sensitivity unlike any I've ever known or experienced. &quot;Angels in America&quot; is perhaps one of the most touching theatrical works of its day."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"I went out and bought this almost immediately after I watched the HBO miniseries. I must say, Tony Kushner's masterpiece looks very good on screen, and it stays pretty faithful to this book (script) with only a few minor changes, most noticeably in Part Two, Perestroika.I normally don't like reading plays, finding the stage directions and minimal characterizations ungainly and somehow disappointing. After reading this, though, I have to admit, Angels in America looks fabulous anywhere: stage, screen, or in this case, even on paper.In the beginning, Kushner gives some &quot;performance notes&quot; about staging. There should be minimal scenery and props, scene changes should be fluid and easy, without the use of blackouts, perhaps suggesting a &quot;single stream of conscious thought onstage.&quot; The special effects (flying, magical appearances) need not be perfect; wires may show, and perhaps it is best if they do; as if the magic of the theater is able to express the *magic* on stage.Reading this script opens a whole new door for people who have only seen the HBO mini-series. And while, I'm sure, seeing it onstage is best, reading the script is still an amazing experience.What Tony Kushner has accomplished in Angels in America is by and far one of the most extraordinary experiences that one is likely to have the pleasure of benefitting from. I know of no other play, or other dramatic enterprise, that engages the mind so thoroughly, in discussion of some of the most complex and controversial issues of our time, or any time.When reading this, you may feel overwhelmed. There appears to be so much happening, and the events may seem a complicated and tangled web. However, once you reach the end, to Prior's haunting yet uplifing closing monologue, there is a part of you that will understand it,no matter how small it may be. It sinks in, the message, the beauty, the pure humannes of the story, and you are changed.The Great Work begins..."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"A playscript is a blueprint for a performance--a document that is intended to be interpreted by those trained in theatre arts. For this reason most non-theatre people find reading a play akin to a tour of purgatory: it is often extremely difficult for the layman to imagine how these strings of words on a page will actually play on a stage before a live audience. This is particularly true of Tony Kushner's ANGELS IN AMERICA, a play which even many theatre arts people (myself included) find very, very flat on the page; consequently, I do not really recommend it for those without a background in theatre arts.Set in 1980s New York and subtitled \\"A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,\\" the play concerns a group of largely homosexual men who find themselves caught up in series of disasters that range from love to religion and from politics to philosophy--and most specifically caught between the rising tide of AIDS and a generally unsympathetic society. In the midst of this, AIDS patient Pior Walter begins to have a series of visions, which may be fever dreams, medicine-induced hallucinations... or, most unnerving of all, real. His long dead ancestors rise to speak to him, the floor cracks open to reveal a burning book--and at the conclusion of the play's first half a beautiful woman with majestic wings crashes through his roof. She is the Angel of America. He is, she tells him, a prophet, and she has come to bring him a message for mankind.Intertwined with Prior's other-earthly experiences are oddly parallel lives. Joe and Harper Pitt are a deeply dysfunctional couple doubting their faith in the Mormon Church, Joe a closeted homosexual, Harper a valium-addicted and mildly psychotic woman given to visions as strange as those of Prior Walter's. And as further counterpoint historical figure Roy Cohn (1927-1986), among the most sinister figures of 20th Century America, finds himself taunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg as he drifts toward his own AIDS-induced death. The characters swirl in and out of each other's lives and dreams, playing to stereotypes and yet defying them, arguing politics and philosophy and love and death--and it is fascinating stuff. And the play, which ran six hours and had to be performed across two consecutive evenings, astounded theatregoers: nothing similar had been seen on Broadway since the days of Eugene O'Neill's MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA.But for all of this remarkable vortex of dreams and realities, issues and ideas, there is a tremendous problem with ANGELS IN AMERICA, and even the most casual reader should be able to spot it. When an angel crashes through the roof you naturally expect startling revelations to follow--but having spent the first half of his play building to this amazing climax, Kushner seems to have painted himself into a dramatic corner. The ideas, issues, and characters continue to swirl as brilliantly as before, but the angelic revelations and their gradual unraveling seem to be born more of desperation than of true originality.Is ANGELS IN AMERICA a play that will resonate through time? It is possible, but I think it unlikely. To return to MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA, that play is very much of its era in terms of style--but it deals with themes and ideas that are of all times and places, and in consequence it remains as powerful today as it was when it startled Broadway some seventy years ago. But ANGELS IN AMERICA is not only stylistically of its place and time, it is also a play that deals specifically with issues peculiar to its place and time, and as our thinking about these issues change the play's authority begins to fade. While it remains required reading (and ideally required viewing) for any one who is seriously interested in theatre, it seems unlikely that it will forever maintain that status.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"A breakthrough in theater. Tony Kushner's ANGELS IN AMERICA needs to be read and to be seen on stage (not the tv/movie version). It is groundbreaking, highly theatrical, moving, beautiful. - Robin Rice Lichtig (playwright, NYC, [...])"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"After reading Tony Kushner's &quot;Angels In America&quot; I was thoroughly confused. I thought I had a fair grasp on the basic idea and message of the play, that being that we are all equal and we all struggle and persevere even though we may have differences. But I felt incredibly disorientated after I finished reading the plays. I couldn't put my finger on it but I knew that I had missed something, I felt that there were several underlying messages that Kushner had meant to express upon the reader, which I had missed. I believe part of the reason for that was the way Kushner dealt with the main themes (exploring one's self, coming to terms with who we all are, accepting people for who they are unconditionally). He was so passionate and vivid in dealing with these themes that when he would touch on other themes (such as politics or theories about the creative mind) that I felt I almost didn't have enough in me to deal with those topics as well. While it is true that I feel I could gain very much insight on these plays by reading them a few more times, I did feel very touched by them nevertheless. Throughout the plays as the characters were being developed, I thought Kushner did an incredible job of making the reader feel like part of the story. The effect of bringing the reader into the story more by relating the story to their own lives is not a new practice, but I think Kushner did a great job of doing just that. I was very impressed at how well he related the characters in the plays to fairly universal human issues. I was especially impressed considering that the group he was drawing the issues from was a minority (homosexuals) and yet still managed to make valid connections between that group and the rest of humanity. I think that was a very important piece of the puzzle for Kushner in making &quot;Angels In America &quot; a successful work. He seemed to be trying very hard to show that homosexuals are human to and that no matter what your sexual preference, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or ethnic background you come from we are all connected and all one. I personally thought Kushner did a great job of expressing those feelings. Overall, although a little confused, I thought these plays were absolutely wonderful. I would recommend &quot;Angels In America&quot; to anyone interested in a good look into the struggles and trials of humanity and how through these struggles we can find out the most amazing things about ourselves and others."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Angels in America: A gay fantasia, written by Tony Kushner, is a compelling play about issues in America through the eyes of the gay community. It deals with the issues of homosexuality, race, friendship, marriage, AIDS and many others. Kushner developes the characters by putting them in different situations to see how they will deal with the problem. For example, the character of Joe Pitt is in a marriage with an unstabel woman. He knows in his heart that he is gay, but he does not know how to deal with it, and he does not want to leave her. He has to struggle with the decision amongst other problems that people dump on him. In the end he evolves and begins to overcome his problems. The other characters in the play also have moral issues to deal with. They also have the burdens of life that need to be lifted off their shoulders. The lives of the characters are contrasted with one another. The play is very funny and it also has a moral twist. In one sense the play deals with the government and Ronald Reagan; and how the American people do not deal with the issue of AIDS. In another sense, the play deals with the issue of the life an death. I feel that Kushner's plan was to make the reader see how indecent the world is about serious issues. I think the play shows how the self evolves with life experiences. The characters in the play are forced to deal with themselves whether they want to or not. Kushner writes a very magical play that deals with very realistic issues in America. Kushner writes a play that's makes you think and re-evaluate your views. The play has had a huge impact on my thoughts about the political as well as the moral issues. Angels in America is definitly a book that everyone should have the chance to read in their life!"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"After reading Tony Kushner's Angels in America, I was left overwhelmed. Before reading this play I was never forced to think about the issues that he discusses in such a profound way. His play brings into focus the injustice that society inflicts onto not only the gay population but also many other minorities. Through his diverse set of characters a broad spectrum is presented.His play presents the way of thinking that occurred in the 80's and how that has transgressed to society today. Each one of his characters is very realistic, and by all means very individual in that none of them possess the same type of personality and moral beliefs.You have Joe and Harper, both of whom are Mormons and can't even deal with each other let alone with society as a whole. Although they are Mormon's, neither are meant to be and are in denial about their true beliefs. The acts of sinning that they commit are a disgrace to the Mormon's I'm sure. They couldn't be more opposite each other either. But although they each have issues, you can see by the end of the play that they overcome their struggles and attempt to live the American Dream.Prior is also a character that has his weaknesses but when forced to deal with the fact that he has AIDS, he digresses to the mentality of a child, only wanting to be taken care of, leaving him privy to loneliness. His lover, Louis, is a man that pretends he is strong when in reality he is not at all. He knows what love is, but has issues that hold him back from expressing it when those he loves, needs him the most.The character that seemed to be the most in denial was Roy. Roy was not only in denial about his homosexuality but also the fact that he had AIDS. He wanted everyone to believe that he was perfect and that he could handle anything that came his way. When in reality Roy was no stronger than any other character in the play. He had an image to keep and felt he would be looked upon, as less of a creature if anyone knew the truth about him. You can see how he starts as a strong character and tragically falls and becomes a man that is bitter, and ignorant to the world around him.This play is very vivid in its descriptions and although some of the details could have been left to the reader's imagination, I feel overall, the mental pictures that I got from this play was what made it all the more meaningful. To imagine such suffering and struggle is not a hard thing to do, but the discouragement that they must have felt when being diagnosed with AIDS was surely the biggest tragedy. In the 80's AIDS was known as a gay disease and no one wanted to know anything about it because it scared them.As a product of the nineties I feel I can appreciate this play more than say some that are more set into their ways and feel very insecure with the ideals that they possess. I have no doubt that my open mind is what allowed me to feel for these characters and what made me relate to the issues and characters being presented.

I reread the same plays when my college decided to put on both productions. On the whole I believe these plays were so acclaimed because of the times they were written in, and not much more.In Millenium Kushner does make some of his characters stereotypical homosexuals and some of his characters, like Harper, often speak English as if it were a second language. I don't know anyone who speaks like this woman does! Several moments in the play become preachy and you often walk away feeling battered and bruised into seeing Kushner's point. But the characters Joe Harper and Roy Cohn make this play a must-read. These two characters are so wonderfully depicted in scenes together and with other characters that you know them by the time you close the book.When you finish Perestroika, you are likely to feel that Kushner sold out, even though the writing is much more audience friendly and less preachy. It is an easier read than Millenium but many of the conflicts end far too conveniently while others will put a smirk on your face.My advice--read these plays twice. Once for enjoyment, and again to try to understand what specifically Kushner is trying to say."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"&quot;Angels in America&quot; is truly one of those rare, astronomical events that defies simple description.

I'm not kidding. You could, and can, spend years trying to understand all the layers of this play, discovering something new every time you open the pages. &quot;Angels in America&quot; is something can cannot be prepared for. You can't say to yourself &quot;I'm going to be reading about gay people&quot; or &quot;I'm going to be reading a comedy about A.I.D.S&quot;, or anything else, because &quot;Angels in America&quot; simply is too complex, steeped in metaphor and language to really prepare yourself for.

I could not put this book down. The graphic detail kept me turning page after page. This is one of the only authors who kept me intrested throughout the whole play. Tony's attention to detail gave incite to someone like me, who has no real idea of the trials that homosexuals, may incur, in dealing with day to day life. The characters, wether homosexual or hetrosexual, all struggled with the American way of life. Each and every character seems to be content in their own way of life, their dream if you will; however, once they come to terms with their sexuality, religion, or mental state, they realize that their perfect dream world has become a nightmare. Kushner does an amazing job keeping the reader enthralled with the lives of these characters. However, the choppy scenes and constant referal to the beginnning of the book began to confuse me. Overall, I believe that this book should be read by all because it is very informative about current issues in today's world such as AIDS, death, religion, and sexuality. Kushner's main issue that he is trying to portray to the reader is that everyone, at some point in time has a rise and a fall.

At first, it seemed to be a typical emotionally draining type of play where I would become depressed just thinking that I needed to finish reading it. I have never been so wrong in my short lived life. This play kept me awake to all hours of the night because it captured my attention like no other piece of literature. It discusses almost every contraversial topic associated with the 1980's. Covering such &quot;taboos&quot; as homosexuality, AIDS, politics, racism, and religion. Not only did it cover all these topics in sufficient and extremely intellectual context it had other qualities that aided to its jaw-dropping dialogues. Almost every scene seemed to relate to the theme of the play in an abstract or symbolic way. Personally, I intend on seeing the play live and I recommend that everyone read both &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot;. They each opened my eyes to the reality and pain behind the medical information that is always given about the disease.

Prior fights with his disease, Joe wrestles with his identity, Louis challenges his ability to love, and Harper tests her sanity. Each character is able to learn and reveal something about themselves as a result of their individual struggles. It is these revelations that set them free. It is because of each character's story that &quot;Angles in America&quot; touches every person that reads it. We can relate to trying to overcome obstacles that have been thrown in our way. Through their remarkable stories, we learn about true love, accepting who we are, and making sure to live life to the fullest no matter what blockades life may throw in your way. This dramatic play discusses serious issues such as AIDS and religion, but it never loses its humor in the process. Overall, &quot;Angels In America&quot; is an inspirational play that shows us how difficult life can be, but that should not keep us from wanting more life. Kushner's characters learn life's terrible lessons, but manage to handle them in an extraordinary way. By the end of the play, we catch ourselves saying, &quot;I want more life&quot; just as Prior does."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Tony Kuhsner's opus magnum, &quot;Angels in America&quot; consists of two, equally brilliant parts: Millennium Approaches and Perestroika. Both parts share the same characteristics: beautiful, beautiful dialogue,mesmerizing characters, intriguing story, and erudition. I prefer Perestroika because it appears to be more eloquent and thought provoking. The first part impressed me: I was, ad literam, floored, when I read it. Kusnher is an artist of great power, postmodern approach to the subjects of AIDS, the phenomenon of right wing idioty, and self-discovery, works to perfection. It is only so rarely that we find characters so well rounded in service of not only social satire but also a higher point, an exploration of human feelings and nature of ideals. Perestroika brings more fascinating material, but even without it, dialogue like Kushner's resonates on its own. If Louis and Belize were talking about tomatos, it would sound like a profound philosophical discussion between Hegel and Russell, enabled in Kushner's amazing world.The character that stands above all others is Harper (played by Mary Louise Parker in the HBO special), the depressed wife of a (get this:) conservative, republican, closeted gay mormon who worships Roy Cohn.If Euripides of Sophocles were alive today, this is what they would write. &quot;Angels in America&quot; cannot be boxed in and called a drama. It's a play, lets stick to that. In it, you'll find everything from tragedy to satire. It deserves to stand up there with the best plays of our time."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"&quot;angels in america&quot; is the most important play i've ever read. it litterally changed my life forever. it should be required reading for every american citizen. no other play so accuratly reflects our times, our culture, our future and our past"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"As an actor I have a very discerning eye when it comes to plays, and i was amazed with this piece of literature.

But the play in print sounds wordy and quite often vague, vain and even void. It has probably aged though it might only have been easy and politically correctly incorrect at the time. A little bit of anti-Reagan anti-republican anti-establishment oration and a lot of banal very trite and at times humdrum conformist discourse. The trick is in bringing together blacks, Jews, Mormons, progressive snobs and popular effetes and make it all react in a high shocking half pleasing, pleasing because shocking and shocking because pleasing, situational comedy. You add homosexuality on that and it becomes provocative, with a queen and a few other characteristic personages. And the morality is all contained in one sentence page 204: \\"You have to reconcile yourself to the world's imperfectability by being thoroughly IN the world but not OF it.\\" You can't imagine anything more demagogical and opportunistic than that. And it comes to a second decision or piece of advice: \\"The rhythm of history is conservative.\\" And there we are with another fashionable idea of the 1990s: the death of history. There is no history any more when a certain level of development is reached. History does not move any more. History is conservative, conservational. Yet in spite of all that the play is funny. In fact it is a farce, a melodramatic farce and it may survive because of this dimension. It is a farce coming from the Reagan and Bush sr years and announcing the ridiculous end of the hope that was born with Clinton and buried by him long before due. When a period that could and should have been of change ends up in the savory and stinking rigmarole procedure of the impeachment of the President because of some sexual caprice of his in the Oval Office and the subsequent discussion whether sex requires penetration and whether buccal penetration is sexual. This kind of farce died with the Bush jr backlash, the war on Iraq and the birth of maybe a new hope of change after eight years of punishing castigation. You have the right to wonder if history is not a farce, but I am afraid that farcical dimension comes from the on-looking eye that does not believe life can be horrible to the point of justifying death.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"If you were one of not a few people who sat through the stage production of Angels in America trying to squelch the little voice that kept crying out, &quot;But the emperor is butt nekkid!,&quot; let it be silent no longer. This book is irrefutable evidence that it is so. Shorn of the splashy production gimmicks and bereft of actors who can rise above the banal material, this play is revealed as a sophmoric, sentimental and slipshod piece of politically correct feel-goodism. Both the dialogue and the handling of the plot are embarrassingly awkward. The play reads as an exercise in adolescent hysteria masquerading as theatre.

First off, it's a fact that Ethel Rosenberg was a communist. Like it or not, she, along with her husband, was a spy! They lied to the American public and they were a detrimant. Reviving Ethel Rosenberg like that was done quite tastelessly. Furthermore, it's a fact that Ronald Reagan has spent 5.7 billion dollars to help research AIDS! It isn't Reagan who helped spread the disease of AIDS it was unprotected sex. Ronald Reagan being a Republican-Conservative was used as a scapegoat in this play. I don't mind if this play is trying to spread a liberal agenda (the more power to you!), but I do mind that they do it in spite of a great President with lies."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"I am in awe of Tony Kushner and these plays.

It is a testament to the vitality of ideas and the triumph of morality over aesthetics, which might be a good thing. For myself, I don't care whether this play treats Reagan fairly or whether the playwright gets his facts straight on Ethel Rosenberg or anything else for that matter. What I enjoy is the writing. The play as a whole doesn't really add up to much for me (this volume works, while the second is virtually a total loss), but individual scenes are powerful and memorable. Some of the writing seems to me to be unrivaled in American writing. Roy Cohn is well-conceived, whether he resembles the historical figure or not. What a thoroughly imagined monster. As played by Pacino in the TV adaptation, he is poetically reptilian. This is Kushner's doing. But my favorite scene is between Cohn and his doctor. Cohn insists he has liver cancer and not AIDS and is prepared to play rough to force the doctor to change his diagnosis. What a magnificent and \\"true\\" moment. Here we see the depiction of power as perceptively conceived as an episode from the Watergate hearings. I can't remember a playwright ever going right to the heart of evil and yet finding such a richly sentimental way of showing it. The trans-gender double-casting works, as does the magical realism technique. It is a wonderful play."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"After watching the Angels in America DVD, I wanted to see how it was originally as a play, and it does not disappoint. In many ways, I think it's a better experience reading this play than it was to see it on my tiny television. Angels in America is essentially a theatrical work, and the miniseries came off just as that, a filmed stage play, espcially in Part 1: Millenium Approaches, so that it seemed really static, even with, if not because of, Mike Nichols' direction. It was, on the other hand, tremendously faithful to the play script. As far as I could tell, not a word was changed.Part 2: Perestroika, however, had a few changes from the script to screen, and those changes worked well, making the filmed version far more dynamic than Part 1. There's some additional backstory that got dropped in the translation, but the spirit is very much the same.Ultimately, I recommend that you watch the DVD to get an idea of the characters' mannerisms and the staging, then read the script to fully appreciate the poetry of Tony Kushner's language. Buy it and love it!"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Angels in America is probably one of the most important pieces of American theatre of the last twenty years. Outside of musicals, probably one of the few contemporary plays of the period that has had a significant mainstream impact outside of an adapted form (and probably significantly more important then a large number of the adapted ones even before it became an excellent miniseries). And for that reason alone, it is worth reading.But there is more then that.The play actually is one of the most influential plays for a reason. It speaks to a number of socially relevent themes about the American experience. It deals heavily with the roles of gays in society giving a fascinating dialectic about the potential roles that gays can play in society. One of the most interesting social arguments in the play has to be the complete failure of the traditional nuclear family on every level, a statement that can echo the larger social issue where the image of the nuclear family has failed. As a tangent to that, the play deals heavily with the Mormon church, being both one of the only major religions founded in America and one of the religions with the heaviest focus on the family (and one of the ones with the harshest line towards homosexuality).This probably isn't a great play to read if you like to read things out of a larger social context. Honestly, though, I really can't imagine how any American could read this play without connecting it to the larger social issues (and I think that would be true for people of a lot of other nationalities as well, though to what degree I'm not sure).In terms of the actual play, its quite good. But I found (and just about everyone I've asked) has said that they found Part I to be much stronger then Part II."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Tony Kushner's play Angels in America is a look into the lives of people who at first seem exact opposities. However, as the play unfolds we see how all of their suffering is intertwined. The play focuses mainly on the character Prior, who is a homosexual man living with AIDS in the 80's, and all of the people directly and indirectly involved in his life. Not only did this play open my eyes to the horrors of AIDS, it also had a few humorous lines that were well placed. The play is not just about a man living with AIDS it also looks into feelings we have as human being. These feelings are seen through the characters such as the greedy lawyer, the Valuim addicted abandoned housewife, the ex-lover, and the mother of a Mormon homosexual. All in all this play shows how deep down no matter what differences we have on the surface, deep down we are all people who can suffer just as much as the next person."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"The play written by Tony Kushner carries a vital message to today's society. The characters in the play are well thought out and developed for the duration of the play. Through the development of the characters, the reader becomes heavily involved and entangled in the struggles faced by the characters. Kushner is able to carefully weave characters together effectively including a Valium addicted housewife and a homosexual drag queen. The play is brillantly put together, causing the characters to be in direct conflict with one another and, at times, themselves. Roy Cohn, for example, is a homosexual bigot whose very existence contradicts itself. The play ultimately has little resolution. Roy dies still denying what he is, Joe is with Harper, and most of the other characters find themselves at the end of the play in a similar predicament they were in at the beginning. The one thing that does change is the characters no longer have a feeling of loneliness. Loneliness seems to be the central issue of the play. It has an effect on all human beings, no matter what their differences. Through Kushner's play, a very strong and effective message is sent out that homosexuals are human too and their suffering is just as great as the heterosexual society. In essence, Angels in America should be considered a milestone. It captures some of the injustices and struggles faced by a large group of the American population in today's world. The play demonstrates that while the group being discriminated against may have changed, the feelings of those in the minority have not changed. This shows how all groups, including the majority, are equally human because of their fear of loneliness."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Tony Kushner's epic play &quot;Angels In America&quot; is a phenomenal play because of its reality in today's society. There is no other play that I know of that accurately reflects our times and culture on such a controversial issue. The characters in the play become alive and you find yourself alive in each scene with them. Millenium Approaches and Perestroika tells the story of a few people trying to make sense of a cynical and judgmental world. In these characters' daily lives, Kushner deals with controversial issues such as homosexuality, AIDS, mental illness and the social and political problems they encounter. Beneath all the political and moral (religious) outrage, lurks a desire to understand what it means to live and die of AIDS in a world that is disconcerted about human life. Kushner also opens our eyes to the political leaders of the eighties, mainly Ronald Reagan, and their avoidance in dealing with the issue of AIDS. This is keenly shown in the conversations of the characters throughout the play. The choice of title for both parts of the play remarkably ties it all together. As the millenium approaches we can see society is starting to feel some compassion and hope for those suffering with such misfortunes as AIDS and mental illness which have been shrouded with a stigma. The ice is beginning to melt as society and political leaders can no longer avoid these maladies. The cold war, Perestroika, is finally dropping its curtain."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"I recall the critical reception that Angels in America received at the time of its initial Broadway run. At that time, it was edgy enough to make many audience members uncomfortable --which it would certainly not do today -- yet it also came at just the right moment to be a coming-of-age manifesto for the gay rights movement. Only the boldest of critics would have dared to disparage it during that heydey of political correctness. And it isn't a horrible play; it's only horribly flawed. But it was also perfectly positioned to capture a mass audience. It seemed transgressive enough to lure aging baby boomers into a sense that they were seeing something risque (the same way much simplistic, commercial hip hop does), yet it piled on enough superficial schlock to make them feel good. This is not to say that the plays don't have great moments; they do. These are individuals scenes, individual lines, one or two extended speeches and sequences. These are sufficient to give the plays an illusion of depth, an illusion of grandiosity and significance. But Kushner lacks the vision to make the plays as a whole truly deep, to put his good moments at the service of a great idea (as opposed to a trite, cloying idea). And he lacks the discipline to purge the plays of their truly atrocious moments, which include some incredibly stereotypical characters, redundant monologues that do nothing but bluster and a drawn-out ending so banal and embarrassing that it is shocking to me that someone did not force Kushner to change it. There is also a lot of second-rate let's-laugh-at-the-Republicans-style humor. There are also many religious ideas being thrown around loosely and ultimately put at the service of a formula no more sophisticated than what Harold Bloom identifies in The Anxiety of Influence as Milton's weak Satanic proclamation \\"[e]vil, be thou my good,\\" which reduces the grandeur of Satan to a mere childish rebellion. If I were to describe the overall feel of the plays, it would be like Dostoevsky's The Possessed (better translated as Demons) being written by Ron Howard.I am aware that I am bucking the critical tide on this, but I would be surprised if fifty years down the road Angels in America has anything near the status that it does today. We are still too close in time to Angels in America to be able to judge it at the kind of critical distance necessary to separate ourselves from the political and emotional tenor of the moment, on which the plays so strongly depend for their sustenance. Suffice it to say that I have never seen or read another major play nor read a major novel that is so cheap, so full of cliches, so not in control of its own vision. It has, in many ways, all the big flaws of a Hollywood end-of-year blockbuster, which takes whatever good ideas it might have had and ruins them. While the Nichols movie version unquestionably plays up some of the bad stuff, its bigger problem is what it cannot possibly play down, what is, in other words, there in the text.As a recent reviewer wrote, speaking of the movie version:\\"After five and a half hours of taking up your time, what does Angels reward you with? A version of heaven that seems cribbed from those old 'Calvin Klein Obsession' ads, the inane conclusion that God deserves to be 'sued', and the oldest screenwriting cop-out in the book: hinting that it all may have just been a dream. This is followed by a lame Wizard of Oz reference that essentially mocks everything it just attempted to say, and more false endings than Sugar Ray Leonard's boxing career. My grandmother, a wise old schoolteacher-type, used to be fond of reminding people that 'an emptiest barrel makes the most noise.' While Angels in America does have some redeeming qualities and a handful of good performances, what has it really said after taking up six hours of the audience's time? That AIDS is a terrible disease? That there just might not be a God up there watching over us? That, as Woody Allen once said, life is full of misery, loneliness and suffering - and it's all over much too soon? Or perhaps, as Jerry Springer said, that we should take care of ourselves and each other? With all the noise this empty barrel makes, it's amazing that it still manages to be so full of itself.\\""},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"This is a brilliant play.

I'm not one to read and this book from the first page grabbed me and practically sucked me in. I found myself unable to put it down. I wanted to read more and more just to find out what was going to happen next. I admire how Kurshner gets the reader so in tuned to the book. He has a way of grasping the readers attention and keeping the readers attention til the very end. Although some parts of the book through me off a bit, overall I could really relate to what was being explained. I liked especially how Kurshner talks about real issues that many people in society today turn their heads on and even sometimes discriminate against. I have extremem respect for people who are not afraid to be themselves and don't care what others may think of them. Kurshner presents three different prespectives on homosexuality. One of a couple very open about their sexuality, anotherof a man who isn't really sure of it and last a man who is living in denial. All are very real situations that society is faced with today. Also, there is a large number of people living with AIDS and are trying to cope with it as best they can. I experienced loosing a close friend of the family who was homosexual with AIDS and I know how hard it is to watch someone you love so much just wither away slowly and to see such fear in that persons eyes. It really makes an impact on ones life. I can't explain in words how I felt when I finished this book. All I can say is that it made me realize that life is short and we shouldn't take it for granted. Society spends to much time critizing people instead of making friends and enjoying having the opportunity to experience and know so may unique individuals. Again I say this book was fabulous."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Angels in America is a graphic portrayal of the effects of Aids on two homosexual men, Roy and Prior. Kushner at various points of the play describes graphic sexual and medical scenes, which are offensive but necessary to prove that there is nothing positive about AIDS. Furthermore, the graphic scenes are essential to illustrate Kushner's idea that the horrors of the modern world are attributed to God abandoning earth. As a reader if you are able to get past the offensive nature of some of the scenes, Kushner paints a very real portrait of the AIDS misconception in the 1980's. With all of the realness of this play it is coupled with scenes of fantasy where Angels and trips to heaven play a crucial role. This is not to say that the play was void of humor. Throughout the play a good bit of humor which Kushner strategically placed to break some of the tension and horror. The friends of both Ray and Prior become intertwined through various circumstances producing a very Dynamic set of characters. To portray the interconnected cast, Kushner often employs a split stage where two sets of characters are carrying on different but related conversations. The result is scenes, which are very hard to read but necessary for the continuity of the play. Also, these scenes would be interesting to watch being performed."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"&quot;Angels In America&quot; is a piece of literature like none I have read before. Its content was quite a surprise to me and I do need to say that there were many parts that were very inappropriate and not needed in order to get the author's points across. Besides the sexual content, the rest was of great importance in the author's explanantion of life and life in America at that. I do think the way that Tony Kushner arranged this play was incredible and it is a great literary piece for the issues that it touches on. Tony Kushner explores many issues that were slowly emerging but trying to be kept submerged in the mid to late 80's. The conflicts within the play were based on the dreams and nightmares of sexuality, religion and politics. Exploration into the deepest realms of sexual preference and trying to escape from the prejudices of society was a lot of what Kushner was trying to make evident to his audience. Kushner focuses mostly on the emphasis of freedom as a dream in America but it becoming a nightmare because of the choices made in life such as sexual preference and what to make of religion. He focuses on nightmares that come from the dream of freedom and the inability to escape. I envision a maze with no end - people walking around aimlessly with no end to their pain and suffering in sight.I really like how Tony Kushner throughout this play makes it very realistic through the conflicts the characters encounter. I enjoy how he discusses openly the &quot;abnormal&quot; society as oppossed to the hum drum everyday life of normal plain characters. The characters he creates makes his audience aware of the struggles that everybody faces through life, and the life-defining questions that everybody asks. He used characters that were lost and did not know what they should be doing with their lives. Kushner makes it apparent that life is the time where we search for the answers and we encounter may conflicts during our search which diverts our attention or helps us along the way.I do not believe that this play was used to make people aware of conflicts of the homosexual life, but of the conflicts and confusion that everybody will encounter in their lifetime; whether it be because of their sexual preference, political stance, religious decisions or sanity. Maybe the distasteful scenes in this play help portray the struggle of life, but I still really do not know what to make of them."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning work, Angels In America, is a monumental masterpiece. Angels In America is a deep imaginative work which transcends from earth into Heaven; while focusing on various issues such as AIDS, sex, politics, and religion. In the two full length plays, Millenium Approaches and Perestroika, Kushner illustrates highly imaginative, expressionistic-surrealistic techniques that tell a story of people trying to not only find meaning within the world, but also to find meaning within their lives. Prior is a man who is not only deteriorating due to the fact that he has AIDS, but also because his lover Louis abandoned him. Through his hallucinative encounters with his ancestors and angels; Prior will come to the realization that even when death is evident, if you have hope, you have life. Louis, Prior's ex-lover, becomes involved with Joe, an ex-Mormon, who decided to come out of the closet when his wife, Harper, who has a mild Valium addiction, is slowly having a nervous breakdown. Then there is Roy Cohn, a successful New York lawyer, who desperately tries to conceal his homosexuality and AIDS because he believes that only heterosexual men, not homosexual men, can have high power and clout.All in all, Kushner wrote an astonishing American play that emphasizes the issues of our time. Issues like AIDS and homosexuality that were blatantly disregarded during the Reagan years, prohibited among religious beliefs, and looked down upon by society as a whole. Moreover, the play transcends deeper than these issues alone. There is a realistic sense of wanting to find meaning in a senseless world, a world that disregards the struggles and tragedies of human life. Finally, there is the longing to find meaning in life, to come to the realization that we should not be shameful for who we are, or what we do, also that we are wonderful creatures who deserve the blessing of more life!Kristen Caprara"},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"My first reaction to the play Angels in America was one of joy. It was joy in response to the unbelievable, uncompromising work that I had just read. The play as a whole not only did justice to the issues and themes that it dealt with but it gave the reader a glance into how those issues function on a real and tangable level. While reading this play I was concerned that because the play did not cop- out or circumvent any of the gritty details all I would feel was shock, but soon that feer was quelled.It was replaced with a sense of awe that someone could so realisticly portray such a managerie of intense emotions in so many different types of characters. The six main characters Joe, Harper, Louis , Belize, Prior and Roy are all haunted by their own ghosts and wrestle with their own demons. Prior with his emminent death from AIDS, Louis with the guilt that he loves Prior but has not the courage to stand by him in his time of need. Or Joe who is struggling with his marriage, sexuality and religon all at once. It seemed that this was a play written from the perspective of out gay men, but that was short- sighted , it is a tale that is writen from a minority position. Any one or any group that has had to struggle to find their place or some semblance of equality know and can relate to the themes that are present in this work. Every aspect of this play weither it be the issue of race, hate, love, fear, sexuality or death they are all crafted in such a way that you are shocked, appauled and riveted at how they function in not only these characters lives but in the fabric of American society."},{"Title":"Angels in America, A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Parts One: Millennium Approaches, Part Two: Perestroika","review":"When starting this book I really didn't know what to expect.

Angels in America gave me a perspective on a gay community I have never experienced in my life. The characters in this book were intriguing, but still understandable. You could see them as the human beings they are.One character in particular that I felt gave me a humanistic view of the realities of our country. That character is Joe, A married man who is a republican morman. Joe hides his homosexuality, and eventually faces it head on after leaving his wife Harper. Joe is a weak man who is very self conscience of how others view him.Mormans, Jews, African Americans, and Homosexuals, are a few of the races, religions, and sexual preferences looked at throughout this book. The conversations between Roy and Belize and a good example of race issues in America. Roy a Jewish lawyer is very hostile towards Belize an African American nurse and drag queen. America has obvious racial and religious issues that are often left with out saying a word about them. Angels in America faces this problem head on. It takes the issue and puts it in your face, bluntly. It is a reality check that often people don't want to hear.Angels in America is a great story I advise everyone to read.

Yeats: &quot;The Second Coming&quot;Tony Kushner's Angel in America reminded me of Yeat's words since the play presents an American gay community falling apart, and wreaked havoc by AIDS and fear in the 80s through Reagan's presidency. I love the way Kushner depicts marvelously and humorously the gay community because it reveals that social rejection and repulsion toward a minority affects the behaviors of this society's all members to the point where they behave anti-heroically. I was very impressed how each character in the play represented a &quot;type&quot; of being whom we all are inside ourselves.Louis, who thought he knew what love was truly about, abandons Prior at the first minute Prior's illness aggravates. When I read that scene, I felt the same way as Prior. I was disgusted as well as disappointed at Louis' decision. It seems that AIDS and the view of society toward it had influenced Louis so heavily that he had to quit Prior. I do not wish to judge Louis for his actions because I believe that Kushner's intention was to show us that human love often becomes impermanent and illusive. This made me realize the mediocrity of human nature along with mine, which has often submitted to social pressure and prejudice toward AIDS.Joe refuses, at the beginning, his sexual orientation, which poisons his relationship with Harper. Then, Harper, at the end, refuses Joe's accepting his homosexuality and wants him back with her. Her love of freedom from Joe has become a fear of loneliness. America advocates individualism, but it can often be transformed into solitude. Moreover, Joe and Harper struggle firmly to create a happy American family, which, in their case, leads to suffering and despair. The hypocritical behavior of a society, which forces gays to remain silent about their sexual orientation, does not solve anything, but rather exacerbates tensions in couples such as Joe's and Harper's.Hannah, Joe's mother, is part of this society that refuses reality and prefers silence to truth. She indeed feigns not to understand her son Joe when he confesses his homosexuality to her. Kushner draws a sorry reality of parents who refuses their children's homosexuality.Finally, Roy hates what he is and persecutes his \\"peers.\\" Kushner describes wonderfully how society can annihilate human beings' self-esteem to the point where they hate themselves and one another.Again, Kushner is a master at representing society's negative influence toward its members, which pollutes human relations such as Louis and Prior, Joe and Harper as well as Joe and Hannah for instance.It was a great experience to read this gay comedy. As a white heterosexual man, I felt very uncomfortable while reading homosexual erotic scenes or even platonic homosexual love scenes, which made me realize that the homosexual community may have felt the same way while reading most of human literature about love, which is heterosexually-oriented. It is indeed difficult to imagine what and how the gay minority has felt when most of the time forgotten in the literature of love. I am grateful to Kushner for this work of art, which made it possible for me to grasp that feeling."},{"Title":"House on Fire","review":"New York fireman Kevin Dempsey has arranged a perfect life for himself, his former-model wife Polly and their 3 year old daughter Zoe. He loves his job, has bought a new house for Polly and Zoe, and wants to have many more children. But Polly and Zoe don't come home from a trip to DisneyWorld, and Kevin's perfectly planned life falls apart.And there the mystery begins. As more characters are added to the mix, the story becomes more complicated. Why did his alcoholic policeman father kill himself? Why is his brother Frank (also an alcoholic policeman) being pursued by the Internal Affairs Bureau? Why is his brother Kevin so angry? And how could anyone with such a troubled family possibly be as supportive and loving as his sister Margie? How can someone as emotionally damaged as Kevin recover from all the cruel blows being delivered to him?The pace never slackens in this tense melodrama, and you'll be turning pages until the end.I read &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; also by Denis Hamill and was equally engaged with that book."},{"Title":"360 brilliant and instructive end games","review":"I can't imagine nobody has reviewed this book yet.

Reading Jane Austen's descriptions of what her modiste planned for her next gown is amusing, as well as the anecdotes involving long trains.This book is about more than the cut of women's clothes; it is an exegesis of costume history as seen through the eyes of its wearers and makers. It exalts the humble professions of seamstresses and patternmakers, and inspires modern designers through a scholarly reverence for technique.I have graded up several of the patterns to usable working specs, but I don't recommend this to the casual sewer; one must have a solid background in pattern drafting to attempt this. (Although the Vionnet &quot;flapper&quot; dress is a good project for the beginner.) If you're a hard-core pattern collector and enthusiast, you need this book. If you're looking for EZ instructions for a period costume, buy a Folkwear pattern."},{"Title":"The Cut of Women's Clothes 1600-1930","review":"From a broad perspective this book is helpful in delineating the various periods of costume. The patterns are useful, but not plentiful.However, the book has several shortcomings. Firstly it is printed on very cheap paper (this is a reprint version) and the black and white pictures/prints of paintings are very murky and badly reproduced on even thinner cheaper paper than the text.The content of the book is fine for beginners but clearly the book has not been updated to reflect recent study on costume. The writing style is in the form of an endless stream of tit-bit information patched together making this book a boring read. Furthermore, the book is padded out with period quotations about costume, mainly in the form of inventory lists of costume. This adds little to the understanding of costume and the book should have been more tightly edited. Finally there are just not enough patterns in this book to make it a \\"must have\\" title - the patterns are not drawn on a grid so inaccuracies are inevitable. Anyone looking to find a variety of patterns for the period 1600 to about 1850 are going to be disappointed, but admittedly the period 1850 to 1930 is better covered by the book in terms of pattern variety. I will probably donate this book to my local library as it is not a keeper for me. Readers wanting up to date costume information are better served by acquiring texts from the various costume institutes in England."},{"Title":"The Cut of Women's Clothes 1600-1930","review":"This is the definitive period costume book for historical patterns.

And, yes, I actually read it instead of just looking at the pics (of which there are many, many, great examples of historical dress). Although not entirely scintillatingly written (hard to do with a sometimes dry subject such as costume history, it has to be said), it is full of information that I wouldn't have otherwise known (and I've been fascinated by clothing all my life).Across the arc of the book, one can discern the evolution of clothing, and it provides a good background for noting the changes across the years and why they were made. There is a lot covered within, and I feel it's a great source from which to start any kind of costume research."},{"Title":"The Cut of Women's Clothes 1600-1930","review":"There are a number of pattern books that should be in the library of every serious costumer, whether he/she costumes for theater/film or reenactment.

There is much more text than I had thought, and the detail is such that you can picture the garment, seam lines, trim, and all, from her descriptions!

However \\"In Xanadu\\" is an excellent book to take on vacation. It is a lucid and sometimes hilarious account of a very low-budget journey through Asia ($1100 financed the entire trip through Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and the breadth of China.) And best of all, no matter how badly your own vacation turns out, you can always pick this book up and find Dalrymple in a more miserable spot than you are.There is also beauty and moments of scholarly excitement when the author identifies some feature of the landscape with a passage from Marco Polo's journal. I particularly liked his description of a nocturnal train trip through Turkey. He sees dry flatlands transformed into lush pasturage and wonders at the source of water. Then the train comes upon a river, and Dalrymple unfolds his map:\\"Its Turkish name, the Firat Nehri, meant nothing to me. Only when I followed the thin blue line down through Syria and out towards Baghdad, did I see the river's more familiar name --- the Euphrates....Is there another river which carries with it so many associations?...The river which ran through the Garden of Eden, one of the five rivers of the Apocalypse! Following its course on the map, its banks are littered with the names of the ancient cities it once gave life to: Mari, Nippur, Uruk, Larsa, Erdu, Kish.\\"The above paragraph is a rare flight of fancy for Dalrymple. His normal style is less flamboyant, laced with dry British humor where he tends to be the butt of his own jokes. Sometimes the reader is left to discover the humor of the situation through one of his dialogues. Here Dalrymple is in Kashgar, a Chinese city populated by the Muslim Uigurs. He is trying to explain through an interpreter, the lifestyle of the British \`Chairman' Elizabeth II to an old mullah:\\"Salindi [the interpreter] frowned. \`He wants to know how many sheep, donkeys and camels your chairman owns.'\\"'Tell him she owns no camels, but has very many horses and a great number of corgi dogs.'\\"The information was passed on. The old man nodded his head as he listened.\\"'Sir, this man is now asking about the dog which is called \`khor-qi. He asks whether these \`khor-qi' are good to eat.'\\"'Tell the old man that they are delicious.'\\"\\"In Xanadu\\" is travel writing in the grandly eccentric British tradition: a horrid climate and high adventure, laced throughout with dry wit. Be sure to get a copy for your next vacation. I'm going to loan mine to a friend who thinks she wants to visit Iran and Afghanistan (last year she trekked through Outer Mongolia). Either \\"In Xanadu\\" will dissuade her from her planned adventure, or else she is as bonkers as Dalrymple."},{"Title":"In Xanadu","review":"Erudite,funny, exciting, and amazing in its author's breadth of knowledge - especially considering his youth.

This is a pretty good travel book; I like travel writing and have read a lot of it. Dalrymple's work is as good as anyone else. In addition to this, I recommend Caroline Alexander's &quot;The Way to Xanadu.&quot; Dalrymple follows Marco Polor to Xanadu; Alexander follows Coleridge. Both end up at the same place, but follow very different routes to get there. Dalrymple follows Marco Polo's route along the silk road and he shares some pretty interesting history of all the places he visits. Alexander visits the places mentioned in Coleridge's diary in the period just before he wrote the fragment of a poem about Xanadu, which leads her to a variety of places including Florida, amazingly enough."},{"Title":"In Xanadu","review":"Dalrymple is a bird dog who tracks his subject, follows in his footsteps, sniffs out his moods, sorts through details in order to tie up knots, and all the while tells a good story of his own.

This was accomplished while he was a student at Cambridge and he got the idea because this was the first time most of the Karakorum highway was open to travellers, enabling him to follow about 80% of Polo's route for the first time in centuries.The author (with two friends, one for wach half of the journey) went from Jerusalem through Cyprus, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and China. Throughout his journey he researched the traces of Marco Polo and the other aspects of history. As such, he inserts lengthy historical digressions into the book. It's recommended that you persevere with them as they make the reading so much richer.He writes with an energetic and lively humour. The journey was one to have made it impossible not to produce outrageous situations. They encounter every trouble imaginable from Red Guards to sickness and go through seemingly every mode of transport.A great way to see 12000km and over five countries through the eyes of an eccentric and erudite your Scottish historian.

But it surely is a remarkable journey told in a very lively, British style. And British style of travel writing generally includes certain jokes thrown at one's own expense. Mr. Williams, surely the finest writer of travel genre of our times, can twist sentences and pass on information very easily.Mr. Williams is travelling through Silk Route and retells his story alongwith snippets of historical bits where required. His girl friend is also travelling which means he has a remark or two on or for her. But he travels and describes the places he visits and the atmosphere and the people and their food.It is not a scholarly book by any standards but he gets his facts right."},{"Title":"In Xanadu","review":"I bought this after reading Dalrymple's Age of Kali. Sadly, as excellent as that book is, this one is a total mess. First of all, there is way way too much extra info on things unconnected to Polo's trek along the Silk Road. You basically need a degree in the History of the Middle Ages to figure out the obscure references. I got the idea Dalrymple was showing off. Considering he supposedly knows all this arcane stuff, how come this obvious well-educated guy spends much of his trip searching for people who speak English to help him? Did he not use his vastly developed cranium to think of buying a few phrasebooks before heading out? Or how about studying at least one of the languages used in the region?Add to this he is, for want of a better word and no hate mail please, pussywhipped by the two females he travels with. One is so much of in a hurry to blitz across to the Indian subcontinent it's annoying beyond belief.With much better editing, this could have been as brilliant as Age of Kali. It is still a decent read but Dalrymple would be wise to read \\"Chasing Che\\" to see how to put together a follow-in-the-footsteps-of-the-greats travel book."},{"Title":"Great souls at prayer;: Fourteen centuries of prayer, praise and aspiration, from St. Augustine to Christiana Rossetti and Robert Louis Stevenson, selected and arranged by Mrs. Mary W.

On almost every page I found things I thought I knew but had forgotten--as well as plenty of others I should have learned but never did.But don't get me wrong. This book is FUN too.

D'Epiro and Pinkowish do just that.If you know a lot about history, literature, or art, check this book out. If you don't, check it out too."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"This is a clever little volume which, for the most part, I enjoyed. Essentially, it is 101 questions (see the title for an example) with answers provided in short, generally engaging essays. For a triviophile like myself, it provided a lot of interesting stuff, though it's not really a book to be read straight through. Instead, taking a few questions a night should prevent information overload.In addition, the book does have a few weakness. First, there is the unavoidable one of the selection of questions. Depending on your tastes, some questions will likely be less interesting than others. Also, the authors have the occasional tendency to throw in a judgement with their answers which can rankle, especially in the religious realm. Finally, there is the feeling that some of the questions are a bit of a stretch, shaped to fit the format the authors have chosen.Still, I don't get the sense that the book is meant to be a reference work. It is meant to be an engaging exploration of a potpourri of interesting questions. In that respect, it works quite well."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"This informative, fascinating and entertaining volume presents, in a question-and-answer format, a compendium of 101 easy-to-memorize lists from the fields of history, mythology, religion, literature, art, music, mathematics and science, which are considered to be of great significance for our culture.Each question is well-organized according to the number of items in its answer, which can vary from three (Who where the 3 Magi, and what gifts did they bring?) to twenty-four (What are the 24 letter of the ancient Greek alphabet?).Each precise answer, instead of giving a mere list, is accompanied by an engrossing essay that places the list in its cultural and historical context and details some well-researched facts about it that aid our understanding of its meaning.As a bonus, for those interested in doing further research in a specific topic, the book offers a list of suggested reading, which includes books as well as Web site addresses. A very thorough index is also offered for those interested in looking for a particular subject.Overall, this is a practical, charming and pleasurable reference to either consult or flip through, recommended for readers of all ages eager to explore our culture's most captivating lists, series and hierarchies.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"I highly recommend this book. It's fun to look through the lists (presented as questions) and try to guess the answers, but what really sets this book apart from most &quot;list&quot; books are the essays that accompany each list. They are witty and informative. You start reading and don't want to stop.This book would make a great gift for all the &quot;Cliff Clavins&quot; on your gift list. And be sure to get one for yourself!"},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"I found this book absolutely fascinating. Short well written essays filled in details on the history and cultural setting of a wide variety of items from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to the 7 kinds of plane triangles.The topics chosen varied widely over many centuries and many different cultures. While I was familiar slightly with perhaps half of the topics, the essays enriched my understanding of even those about which I thought I was most knowledgeable and informed me on many topics which were previously unknown to me. I could pick up the book and open it to any page and enjoy myself whether I had time for just a single essay or could indulge myself for an hour. Everyone should have fun reading this book."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"I just finished reading it cover to cover and found it a truly enlightening and FUN read. I have loved these type of books since my first purchase of \\"An Incomplete Education\\" many years ago, as well as Charles Panati's books. The format of \\"What are the Seven Wonders of the World?\\" lends itself nicely to reading it on short breaks. I was amazed at how much I could learn in so little time. At last, I finally understand the intricate history (and relationships) of all of the Kings and Queens of England - and it was absolutely painless. There's too much good stuff in the book to mention it all here. If you love trivia, or wish to expand your horizons in order to becomes a modern day Leonardo (Da Vinci), this book is for you. I can't wait for the next volume.Now, please excuse me -I have to keep my audition appointments for \\"Win Ben Stein's Money\\" and \\"Jeopardy\\"!"},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"I bought this book maybe a year ago and it has been a favorite ever since. Over 100 topics, each typically a few pages, covering a variety of 'lists.' These include, 'The 4 properties of a musical tone', 'The 12 knights of the Round Table', 'The 10 major U.S. wars', 'The 12 signs of the Zodiac, and the source of their names', 'The 15 decisive battles of the world (according to historian Edward Casey)', 'The 4 horseman of the Apocalypse', 'The 9 great gods of ancient Egypt', etc. This collection includes an incredible variety of topics, each treated sincerely, and with an insightful, light, and frequently very humourous style. One of the best attributes of this book is that it does not matter if you only have 5 minutes available for reading, or 5 hours, this book will deliver. Also, the order of reading is of absolutely no importance. My preference was to just open the book to a random location, flip backwards or forwards to a random topic, and just start reading. It really is fascinating stuff. And with over 100 topics, even if only 20 or so are highly interesting for you, I think you'll agree the book is worth every penny of its price. And, for whatever reason, the topics are highly rereadable. That is, there is extensive information in each topic, and sometimes after an initial reading, I would go back and actually study the information. Occasionally, several times.Anyway, I just bought another 7 copies to distribute as gifts for the holidays--you know, for those people that I have *no* idea what they might like..."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"There are already 17 excellent reviews here, each one telling how unique this numerical guide to beguiling lists is.

Great for all the trivia buffs out there. Seven Wonders is filled with a variety of questions and interesting answers. I would love for the authors to compile another like this one. This one is on my top 10 list of great trivia books. Highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"This is one of those books where you can pick it up and learn something about a specific topic no matter how many paragraphs you read. For me, it's too easy to keep flipping pages and forget about how much time is going by. Anyone who likes trivia of a historical, scientific, religious, or geographical nature (to name a few categories) is likely to feel satisfied that a particular topic of research was not glossed over simply to provide \\"the list.\\" Authors Peter D'Epiro and Mary Desmond Pinkowish seem to have done their homework, and their writing style is straightforward and always engaging.To give an example of how much information and detail can be found, question #49 asks \\"What are the 6 ranges of the human voice?\\" Aside from simply naming the categories, the ensuing four pages cover a description of the anatomy of singing, voice characterizations and harmonic structures, before continuing in great detail about the specific vocal ranges (upper and lower frequencies), noteworthy singers, and even a history of which operatic pieces were written for which voices. You can read as much detail as you want; there's certainly lots of information to learn about.There are 101 lists (i.e., questions), ranging from \\"3\\" to \\"24.\\" The most common groups are \\"3\\" and \\"7,\\" each of which has nineteen lists. Five of the groupings contain only one list (e.g., \\"What are the 20 regions of Italy?\\"). Probably like most people, I was hoping to learn about some subjects that don't happen to appear in this book, for instance, the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame and the fourteen Stations of the Cross. Still, there's enough interesting subject matter and good reading to keep anyone happy for quite a while. Definitely worth a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"An excellent resource for the knowledge hound and academic question writer.I was hesitant at first about the list concept -- too much almanac, not enough depth, but I am glad to say that those fears were unfounded. This book provides an ecellent one source guide for a variety of fields.It is more accurate and fact checked than the Bathroom Books and is written well.I put this book on par with Panati's series of books though Panati covers less 'academic' material e.g., invention of the flush toilet than this book.They both share clear, pithy writing and in the world of reference books that is *very* nice.I would also recommend this book for people who travel and want doses of information in easy to digest chunks. This one of those books that will make you feel that you were not wasting your time waiting in line or at the airport.It is fun, wonderful resource and if you are into academic competitions this is a definite must have.For the coach who wants his students not to just memorize but actually understand the information this is a great resource. For the student player I would say that every topic in this book will pop up in a tournament from high school through Masters level play.Did I mention that this is a very affordable book even at retail? I usually avoid paying retail for anything but this book got me to veer a bit."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"a fascinating and enriching journey that quizzically uses numbers to break down various hierarchies of knowledge and string together a wide range of topics in a way that almost makes sense.

It not only tells you who the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse were or which 7 European nations were the main colonizers of Africa, but gives detailed, thoughtful (but short and readable) essays discussing the topics. The book's 101 lists are a healthy combination of cultural topics literary, historical, and religious."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"This book offers mini courses of such breadth of learning that it should be required reading in every college curriculum. With wit, energy and precision, it offers us the sort of value-added tour of the West that most people have to pay high priced universities or lecturers to receive.

After seeing a couple of pages, I knew I had to have this book. I bought the book a week later. It is definitely not your average history book filled with the same ol' dates and figures.

If you enjoy reading and you want to gain true knowledge, this is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"Pity the compilers of garden-variety list books. D'Epiro and Pinkowish have redefined the genre. Reading many of the entries is like visiting old friends. And while you're renewing these old acquaintances, you'll meet some fascinating new ones. Whether or not you've had a liberal-arts education (see page 194), you must have this book. The authors have thoughtfully included an extensive (but not unwieldy) list of suggested readings--and websites--to facilitate further investigation."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"I love this book. It contains short, succinct explanations for questions about topics that you may have missed in your formal education. I've found it to be a great coffee table book. Not only does it lend itself to fun discussions with guests, it often gets picked-up when there's a spare moment with a glass of wine."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"The title of this book does not do it justice. Something more along the lines of \\"Stuff you wish you had learned in school, or wish you still remembered, explicated in a writing style that is so wonderful that you will not be able to put it down once you start reading it.\\"I started out intending to read only those entries in which I was most interested. But after reading a few such entries, I was hooked and had to read the whole thing cover-to-cover. Even the entries in which I thought I had little interest engaged me and made me enjoy learning the topics covered. Heck, if you can get me to want to read about the exploits of the Roman and Greek gods, you can get me to want to read anything!A wonderful little book, written with a load of love and fun."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"This book presents dozens of cultural lists, organized not by subject but by the number of elements in the list.Contrary to the far superior Sprezzatura: 50 Ways Italian Genius Shaped the World by the same authors, there is no overall thematic link between entries except that all are finite lists.All this of course makes the book difficult to read at length.Consequently, it appears best to browse through it occasionally or to keep it handy as a reference.Naturally, depending on anyone's preferences, some topics are more interesting than others. The book's treatment is somewhat cursory for someone who has practically no prior knowledge of a subject (such as Greek and Roman mythology as far as I am concerned). But then again, it provides an encouragement to find out more, what is so easy to do nowadays on the Internet.Overall, this book is a very worthwhile investment in time and money."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"For those in the world who feel like they don't know nearly enough \\"stuff\\" (or all purpose knowledge, not specific to any one subject, like literature or history or science...), stop.Breathe in. And behold.\\"What are the Seven Wonders of the World?\\" and the remaining bits of title which go on for quite a bit, is a rather remarkable volume. Thick, informative, and enjoyable, it is a convenient way to learn various bits of trivia, whether simply to learn, or even to impress others (yes, I CAN name the six wives of Henry VIII!). It's fun to go through bit by bit, can be read aloud as a trivia game in itself, and is (thankfully) paperback, so weighs less than it would if hardcover.\\"Wonders\\" gives you everything. Whether teaching about religion (quite a bit is devoted to this subject), math (triangles, trigonometry, Euclid... those things you'd hoped to forget from high school), history, architecture (yes!), music, or even the alphabet, \\"Wonders\\" maintains a light, informative feel... in small portions. Reading each informative essay one after the other might give you a bit of a headache.Highly recommended in small doses. A great way to learn new things, as long as one carefully rations it out. 4 1/2."},{"Title":"What Are the Seven Wonders of the World? and 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated","review":"Absolutley superb trivia book.

I am the type that tries to read through books not meant to be read through, and I must admit I found some entries a little dry. However, others were amoung the most fascinating reading I've ever done. My favorite was probably the title entry on the seven ancient wonders. I had NO idea that the pyramids were that huge!

What a story! What a writer you are!We cannot wait to read your next book. We truly hope that it will be soon.There were so many good parts of the book that it's hard to tell you our favorites. We loved the riddle, and the fact that GERF was FREG backwards, and all the mystery that you created around that.You made the characters seem so real, from your wonderful descriptions. From Richard enjoying his spaghetti and meatballs and milk for lunch, to the way that FREG would talk in that scary voice, you described things so that we really could see them in our minds.You are a very talented young man! We think you have what it takes to be one of America's greatest writers. Keep up the wonderfully excellent work!The book left us wanting more...please write a sequel!With Great Admiration and Respect,"},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"I absolutely loved reading Gerf and I'm sure I will read it many times in the future. I have taught kindergarten through third grade and I wish I would have had this book to show my students when I was teaching. There are many students who love to write but they often need someone to sit next to them and encourage them. Some of these students dream of becoming writers and I hope they hold true to those dreams. There will always be children who would like to publish a book someday and when they are encouraged to do so their self confidence will escalate. Yes, this book was self-published but that is one thing that I really love and value about Gerf. My hope is that students of all ages will read this book, which was written by a fourth grader, and see that it is fine to dream big. I also hope they will learn to keep their imaginations alive instead of allowing it to die off like we tend to do at an early age in our culture.There are many characteristics about Gerf that I love. One of my favorite attributes of this book is the character development behind each one of the characters in the book. They each have their own personality and it's reflected clearly throughout the story. I also love the names of the characters; in particular I love Ms. Issippi. Whenever I read her name it literally made me laugh out loud. The author of this book, Jake Feinbaum, also did a fabulous job creating visual images. With every word that I read the book became a movie to me because it was so clear. He is truly a gifted writer.Being a teacher I'm able to see that the true feelings of a second grader are present throughout each page of the book. Richard struggles with building real friendships partially due to his intellect. He could be seen as an outcast because he's smart, a good writer, and because his imagination is alive but none of this holds him back from being who he is. This book relates to children of all ages and those who are in second through fourth grade will strongly identify with the characters and the author. I'm really hoping that Jake Feinbaum comes out with a sequel to Gerf and that he continues writing. He has inspired me and I'm sure he will inspire every single child who reads this book. This book is well worth the money, especially if you have children or if you're a teacher."},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"For cool, NO self published, and MUCH CHEAPER books about imaginary friends check out this link to amazon search!http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/103-8878862-4775855?url=field-browse%3D4&field-keywords;=imaginary+friends&Go.x;=13&Go.y;=12I rate this book one star mostly because I don't like self published books very much. They are usually less polished and less useful than a book that has been printed by a publisher. Publishing companies are a built in mechanism to sort through all of the written works of the world and to choose the books that are most worth publishing. i.e. the books that are well written and that people will like and that, therefore, will sell over a long period of time.If this book was really worth 8.99 I would think that the kid author could have gotten a publishing deal. As it stands, this author is a just a kid whose dad can afford to print his book. I would venture to think there are 100's of thousands of kids who could write a book just as good as this one (including my kid and probably the kids of everyone who is reading this!) but they don't have the 1,000 bucks necessary to publish them.Also, if the author's dad has enough money to print his 10 year old's book then I'm sure his son won't have a problem paying for college. I would be more likely to buy this book if all of the money went to a good cause like some sort of charity program that encourages young children to write.(...)"},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"I know Jake Feinbaum and can certainly vouch for his abilities and creativity. At age 10, not only is Jake a creative writer but I've watched him write and perform an original piano piece at the asking. It's also worth noting that he can shoot a mean free throw. Good luck Jake and I look forward to seeing what's next. Keep up the great work!!!!"},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"My daughter age 12 loved this book. It was such aninspiration to her that she now wants to write her ownbook. A wonderful story...Looking forward to readinghis next book."},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"I read the sample page of this book and it doesn't look right for my kids. The story is targeted for younger children 6-10 but the vocabulary of the author is too advanced to be able to fluidly read the book to the age group that the book is written.In order for them to understand the book I would almost have to give them vocabulary work sheets. I am all for giving my kids a leg up by exposing them to more complicated english words but by the time my kids were old enough to understand all of the words they would grown out of the story.I also want to add my comment to the previous discussion on the site between a reviewer and the author's father. I found the reviewer to be a little harsh but I did find the review helpful in that it seems to be the only review put forward by someone NOT in the author's family. :)"},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"I read this book with my two children, and we love it. My daughter insists on keeping it in the car with her during our daily drives to and from school. I think because it is written by a kid, children relate well to the humor, the situations and the fantasy. Jake Feinbaum put into words a daydream all children have -- a fantastic friend who will shock your parents, teachers and schoolmates. Although I must say, as an adult I enjoy the book quite a bit, too. My children and I had so much fun reading this book together that I ordered additional copies to give as gifts to their friends. We're well-stocked for birthday parties in the future. Thank you, Jake Feinbaum!"},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"As the father of child author Jake Feinbaum, I feel compelled to respond to \\"Edgar Allen Poe\\" and thank him for his indirect compliment of my son's newly published book, Gerf. First I concede that it is easy to conclude that Gerf is not written by a child. I assure you, however, that Jake wrote and edited every bit of the book and all of the ideas are his own. Neither his mother nor me wrote any part of it.How does a child write a book with a plot with such interesting twists and turns, cool characters, and a surprising conclusion, Edgar Allen Poe? Two answers: hard work and talent. There was many a day when my son would sacrifice playing outside to sit in his room and write and edit. And he does have talent I'm proud to say. Jake has been writing \\"chapter books\\" since he was six years old and has loved reading since he has been able to read. He has an excellent vocabulary, advanced for his age, as reflected in academic testing. I once asked Jake what advice he would give children who wanted to write and publish a book and his answer was \\"Just write.\\"It is easy for us adults to sometimes be cynical and suspicious about children who are successful and have talent. However, there are many children who are gifted in such areas as music, art, writing, sports, math, just to name a few. Didn't Mozart write his first piano concerto when he was a mere five years old? Of course, my son is no Mozart but I think you understand my point Edgar Allen Poe.As to the assertion that the book was self-published, that is true. However, thousands of people are using the self publication route to realize their dream of becoming a published author. This is exactly the case of my son. He always wanted to publish his own book. I encouraged him like any parent would do under the circumstances. He has met his goal and now is working on a sequel to Gerf called \\"Gerf's World.\\"So I don't blame you, Edgar Allen Poe, for being skeptical due to my son's tender age. The beauty of Gerf is that it is a children's book written by a child for children. Maybe some of us adults just can't relate to that.But, readers, if you have your own doubts, I encourage you to buy the book and judge for yourself. It is inexpensive and all proceeds go directly to my son's college fund!"},{"Title":"Gerf","review":"I purchased this book after reading a \\"news article\\" in the author's city's newspaper. I was immediately suspicious of the child's ability to write a short children's fiction chapter book and after reading the book my suspicions were well founded. It appears that the child's father who \\"edited\\" the book may have put a lot more than a few suggestions in.The story of \\"Gerf,\\" the spherical imaginery friend, was boring, unimaginative, and certainly was not worth $8.99.Also let it be known that the book was self published and was never sought after by ANY real publisher. According to the \\"news article\\" the boy's father had the book published by the self publishing company \\"booksurge\\" (you can visit this company at booksurge.com) for at least $899.The author will be better off giving this book out to his friends at school and possibly his grandma."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"No, really. There is enough body fluid, unconventional sexual relations, witnessing one's parents in flagranted de-latex, and maiming of small animals for amusement in this collection of stories to make Pahlaniuk's latest efforts actually look like literature. But the writing is ok."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Although the European drug scene is not necessarily my usual choice of reading material, Welsh's nouveau writing style draws the reader in through its uniqueness alone. Welsh is experimental, not only through his inventive use of the Scottish dialect, but also through the syntax of his work.Acid House is a conglomeration of short stories, an unfortuntely small collection of poems, as well as a creativly written novela. Many of the story plots may seem redundant; however, with a closer read one can find deeper words than a simply tale of excess and depression. My personal favorite story deals with a down and out pub rat and his strangely enlightening discussion with a disillusioned God.Indeed, Welsh has been quite prolific in the last ten years, having a number of books converted to screen, including Acid House. It is nice to see an author taking a gamble and creating something new."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Welsh is truly stunning in this work. Only by reading it can one truly appreciate it. There is reference to several other works, but Welsh twists the stories around to prove his point. One short story seems inspired by The Metamorphosis (Kafka), and Welsh displays genius again, with something that's not a parody, but just a somewhat alternate view.A Must Read."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Welsh throws the macabre and the comic, the outrageous and the bizzare, extreme cynicism and electic wit into a blender to produce this concoction of short stories. A cocktail that is nothing but a compelling journey to the the very edge of human depravity. Taking up where Trainspotting left off and drawing influences from a Clockwork Orange, this work is pure genius. The decade of decadence continues..."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Although I am a big fan of Irvene Welsh, I must say this was my least enjoyed read (and indeed a couple of years later a very boring film). But it does have some excellent stories; for example the 'Granton Star Cause' about a dumped football player, an unwanted lover and later that same evening a pesty son! How wonderful!All in all a good read, and as with all collections of short stories, it can be picked-up and put down. But the fact that some stories may need to be skipped altogether tells it all."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This book literally reads itself and for those people with a short attention span this book is perfect, being a compilation of unbelievably detailed short stories always ending with some sort of twist. I recommend everybody to read this, it is well worth the 15 bucks."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Irvine Welsh is amazing! This collection focuses mainly on the experiences of people familiar with the world of drugs, but you'll relate to them to a frightening extent. Welsh is an absolute master of the language; his work with words is beautiful. And the stories themselves are unforgettable.He goes into the characters minds and draws out pieces of them we don't like - but recognize - and forces us to look at the implications of our thoughts, feelings, and actions. These short stories have made Irvine Welsh my new favourite author."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Wow,what can I say about the talents of Welsh as a writer...Start reading and you 'll find yourself immersed in a bizarre world of surreal fantasy, scathing wit and black humour that is typically Welshian. You 'll find yourself willing to forgo sleep in order to keep reading and you'll be screaming for more when the book is finished.This writing is trully addictive! As a whole the collection revisits the by now familiar territory of working class slums,pubs and raves of Edinburgh and the themes of despair,violence, remorse and dead-end choices that inform so much of his writing,but it's always done with a brilliant, unexpected narrative twist that will leave you gaping at his genius.Not to mention the fact that some stories are downright exhilaratingly funny. The story &quot;Where the debris meet the sea&quot;, for example, had me rocking with laughter.Need I say more?

It is very difficult to find these books but I have been committed to finding them. &quot;Acid House&quot; is a group of short stories that are not linked. They are off topic and confusing at first but once comprehended it is obvious to the reader that they are hidden masterpieces. Irvine Welsh is my favorite author mostly because of &quot;Acid House&quot; and I am awaiting the arrival of the movie."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"A mixture of repulsive yet strangely endearing characters whose empty lives are paraded for our enjoyment. Welsh's depiction of drug use is enough to scare anyone from taking illegal substances but at the same time is strangely attractive. This is one of the few books in recent years I really couldn't put down, at times I roared with laughter, at other times I felt sick to the pit of my stomach: now that's what I call a good read"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"I just wanted to say to the woman who bought this for her son...what were you thinking? the book is called the acid house...that should have been your first clue..anyway...i found it delightful, yeah delightfunl, in a twisted sort of way. I enjoy Welsh's writting, though yes, it is a bit hard for us Americans to understand...i love the psychological twists"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Like all of Welsh's books, Acid House is a far from pleasant read. That said, like a car accident, this book is difficult to look away from. The characters are stunningly well developed, and painfully human in their failings.Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"I have very mixed reactions to the writing of Irvine Welsh. On the one hand, his use of Scottish dialect is astonishing and delightful, and his humor is unsurpassed. He is also remarkable for bringing to literary light a section of modern society (Scottish disaffected youth) that has been largely neglected. On the other hand, while he obviously realizes that his characters are pathetic in the extreme, he work doesn't seem to be informed by any essentially superior point of view. He tags these folks as pathetic losers, but doesn't seem to have any clue as to what they should be doing instead. And perhaps that is the point. The best illustration of the vacuous nature of these people's lives comes from the narrator of the longest (and best) piece in the book (&quot;A Smart C*nt&quot;). He is obviously a person for whom the phrase &quot;Get a Life&quot; was coined, and he does: he is addicted to reading biographies. He does get a life, in fact, many lives via his reading. He just doesn't have one of his own.A fun collection. Obviously, in a work like this some pieces are better than others. But it is definitely worth taking a shot at. I have been inspired to go on to read TRAINSPOTTING (which I now am, and which I am loving also)."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"I first read Trainspotting, then this book. Much the same - very good! He has a talent for creating an entire world around a character then totally twisting it in just four short pages (example: 'Deaf C**t'). Be prepared: the first chapter is a real shocker, but I suppose I should have seen that twist coming. Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This book is so good. All the different stories make it a neverending trip to hell and back. EVERY SINGLE storie was incredible with a suprising twist at the end that made you either or cry. And since most of the stories are pretty short ( but still awesome!) i was able to read at least 1 per class!"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"The junkie's almanac. this is a book that you will never forget. Those who have been there know what he is talking about. This is an awesome book, full of short stories that you can find no where else. Irvine Welsh must live in a constant state of surrealism to see the world as he does. The Acid House will suck in your version of reality and spit out shards of fantasy. Junkie or not, you will never be the same afterwards."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This book, is a very heavy going book. However I would have to say it is gripping exciting and in-comprenhensible all at once! I can assure anybody that by the end ofit you will be able to speak with a perfect scottish accent! Although Welsh can be a little depressing I think that he is a brilliant writer and his novels are inspiring. If one can say that! I don't advise anyone to read this who is likely to be shocked. WE NEED MORE OF THESE!"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"irvine Welsh has an imagination like no other. the Acid house is a spectacular collection of short stories that enables one to see things from many new perspectives. What could one see if she were a fly? According to Welsh, the unimaginable! I'd encourage everyone to read the Acid House if you are strong enough to handle it!"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"I have read all of Welshes' books &amp; have recieved the upmost pleasure that one can get from reading an exelently written book. I find the plots draw you into the world &amp; life being written about,leaving you wanting to know more &amp; more about the charachters, yet when it comes to the end of the book the reader feels satisfyed with the way the author has portrayed them.The narrative method is also a contributing factor to Welshes' successful novels. I find the Scottish dilect &amp; The way he uses the page an involving &amp; interesting way of steering away from the dull &amp; demure. I enjoy Welshes' works thouroughly &amp; hope there will be more to follow."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Irvine Welsh is the most exciting author out there today. The Acid House is another example of his original style and his new approach to fiction. I'm so glad he's around: fiction and life would be extremely boring and monotonous without his work. Irvine Welsh is the next literary legend we've been waiting for and anyone who thinks otherwise is missing out and good riddance."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Welsh is exquisitely fascinating in this roller coaster of a book. Only a true author can make you full of anger one moment and laughing like a school-girl the next. He keeps your mind hopping from one thing to the next in his colourful short stories. It was a gut wrenching twist from the ever popular TRAINSPOTTING. An absolute masterpiece that I recommend whole heartedly."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"The Acid House is distilled Welsh. 100% proof. At a time where short story writing in Scotland is of a very high standard it is sad to report that Welsh has no mastery of the short story form unlike his fellow young Scots James Meek, Alison Kennedy or Gordon Legge, or the old master James Kelman.This collection is very disappointing, and marks the first step in the inevitable downward spiral after the wonderful Trainspotting. However, from here on in, his books just get poorer and poorer.Some stories are very clever (The Granton Star Cause, Lisa's mum meets the Queen mum, Disnae matter). Others are bereft of originality. VAT 69, for example, has the same plot twist as Roald Dahl's classic William and Mary. This then taints your reading of the other stories, because you are left wondering if the idea can be sourced elsewhere. (Granton Star Cause is a filthy minded, but very funny, Metamorphosis, for example).There is some very good Welsh in here, but the most symptomatic of his subsequent work is the longest piece - a novella - that ultimately, like Welsh himself, does not last the pace.If you've not read him before, try Trainspotting. If you have and have liked him while there is something to enjoy prepare to be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This book deisappointed the hell out of me. In every piece Welsh seems so overly obsessed with with surrealism, and possibly more importantly than that, shock value and twists. This obsession has clouded the real thematic punch I know Welsh can deliver, example being &quot;Eurotrash.&quot; A beautiful setup, fine characterization, even a hint of a true, well constructed epiphany that is completely understated by the main character's final realization about his lover. I didn't feel he tried for anything; the decisions were made for him. Despite all of this, the novella that closes the book is so well crafted and so vivid in its imagery and precise in its character construction that it saves the book altogether and wnables me to issue the rating of &quot;2.&quot; Had the rest of the stories been executed like this one, &quot;The Acid House&quot; would deserve the five many other reviewers feel it does. As it is, however, there are too few redeeming qualities to warrant it."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Irvine Welsh had quite some success with Train Spotting. However he has gone to the well once too often with this collection of stories. It is not that they aren't interesting - it is Welsh's fierce determination to use Scottish spellings to exclude the normal reader from understanding what it going on. Yes Scottish is a dialect, but it is not a written language...and I eventually grew tired of trying to guess what the characters were saying or perhaps trying to say.Perhaps Welsh has something to say... my inclination is he does, but his Scottish chauvinistic heavy handiness renders this book to unreadable and therefore boring... a veritable waste of trees."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old son, who is an avid reader. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the info available, because this book is NOT appropriate for a young teen. Thankfully, I decided to 'peruse' the book prior to allowing my son to read it. It was so graphic in language and content that I didn't even want to read it. I managed to skim through two stories before I decided it was just too explicit for me."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Ah didnae think ah'd like this eht fist...But these stories are pock-marked all over with irony, humour and the infallible bad language and vernacular put into use by Irvine Welsh, author of that classic (which I won't name here). This book should be read without that other book looming behind it with a knife to it's back.This is a good read, and that should be enough. But there's people out there who think it could be better, that Welshie disnae have a grasp of the short story, etc, etc... but they're all missing the point something chronic. How often do we get the lives of Eurotrash thrust into our face? Not many of us get to witness first hand a drug raid, or indeed, a baby with a dirty mind... but herein lies Welsh's appeal. See, it's funny. It's so sick that it's funny...situations we'll never get into ourselves. It'll make you squirm and grin in revulsion. Come on people, admit it to yourself. You only ever read Welsh for the kick. Don't kid yourself about what is deemed to be literature or Booker Prize material or politically correct... just enjoy it and stop your whining."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"For just the end story, \\"A Smart C***\\", The Acid House is worthwhile. Welsh is often super morbid and seriously wickedly wacky in these short stories, most of which play out a lot more like bad dreams than pristine vignettes. The closing aforementioned novella, however, is diferent. It's a surprisingly moving character study of a guy who seems to completely lack character. The guy is so totally caught up with analyzing everything surrounding him that he forgets to live. This seems to be subject matter close to Welsh's heart, and he gives it a surprisingly sympathetic treatment. The other stories range all over the place, but have enough energy to make up for a lack of direction. Gotta love Irv. You just gotta."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Irvine Welsh novels are definitely not for everyone. He is the &quot;champion&quot; of the poor, uneducated urban junkies of Edinburgh (Scotland). Since he writes in the first person, his books are, in effect, stories about junkies as told by junkies. The language is vile, the stories are frequently disgusting and depraved. Yet all this shock treatment is not gratuitous; all the stories strike me as oh-too-realistic, as if Mr. Welsh has lived in the gutter with these misfits. After the shock wears off, one is generally left with a feeling of compassion for these poor addicts (there but the grace of God...).The Acid House differs somewhat from the author's other novels. It is actually a collection of short stories, plus a novella. While remaining true to general cause (ie, the plight of the junkie), some stories are rather weak (fortunately, these stories are very short indeed). Others are most memorable, with very clever endings (..I refer you to Irvine Welsh's masterpiece, Filth, for a really good ending!).So The Acid House is the perfect read for Irvine Welsh fans. For others, be prepared for vile language, and sometimes incomprehensible language (..Scottish dialect). And parents, don't even THINK about letting your kids touch this or any other Irvine Welsh book."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"A young man loses his job, home, and girlfriend, meets God in the pub and turns into a household fly. This is a typical plot outline from this hilarious, disturbing, amoral collection of short stories. Welsh is unflinching in his portrayl of the dissafected working class Scotts, whos appetites for narcotic debauchery is as vigourous as their weather is dull.Devoid of any tangible ethical stance, the gritty realism of these stories will speak for themselves. And speak they most certainly do with Welshs customary brilliant pen for transcribing the Scottish vernacular. The book sorely needs a glossary though; lines such as &quot;wis ootay order&quot;, may estrange American eyes.The richness and sheer impact of these stories, make them prime candidates for rereading in the tradition of those other fine writers on the British working classes, Orwell and Silitoe."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Irvine Welsh is one of our great underdog writers--much of his material is repulsive, has little socially redeemable value,--and is often wholly compelling. He carries on the tradition of an Anthony Burgess when it comes to furiously exact dialect and vernacular. He writes of denizens of a wasted rave generation he both embraces and despises. 'The Acid House' is the perfect sampler of Welsh's twisted world view. The twist of 'Eurotrash' will surprise (or sicken) you; 'Snuff' is one nasty study of isolationism; 'Granny's Old Junk' carries on the tradition of Trainspotting. The collection only really derails during the more highly surrealistic stories such as the title piece, but it hardly detracts. Check this out!"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"In comparison with the majority of authors, comtemporary or otherwise, whose works I have read, the stories portrayed by Welsh in 'The Acid House' are done so with amazing talent. It was with delight, after despairing of ever again finding a bit of literature to satisfy my boredom or appeal to my senses, that I was suddenly captivated and totally enthralled by Welsh's flair, unpolished diction, perfectly familiar subject matter, clever humour, and wonderfully cynical insight. Here's an example of the language for your discretion:There was a shuddering bang and Whitworth seemed to vanish into the house. For an instant, it was like some kind of theatrical illusion, as if he was never there. In that split second, I thought I'd been the victim of an orchestrated wind-up between Gal and Tony Whitworth. I even started laughing. Then I looked into the lobby. Tony Whitworth's convulsing body lay there. What once was his face was now a broken, crushed mass of blood and grey matter.In any case, to read this book is to take the risk of being drawn into the inescapable trap that Welsh craftily sets for his readers and to be caught in it right to the end of the book, at which point you're left in a sort of withdrawal that can't be any worse mentally than breaking a junk habit."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Without a doubt one of the funniest works anyone will ever read, know it is not for the judgmental or the too terribly sane. The humor and ironies not to mention the writing style and the translation of lower-class Glasgow speech into written text will entertain for hours.The intricately linked stories, really anecdotes, off handed poetry and the genuine angst felt throughout the book, laced with deadpan humor and some of the most uproariously funny situations I can ever recall make for a fantastic escape from the everyday world.The characters are vivid and true to their own characters throughout the book. The local and behaviors exhibited by everyone depicted are delivered with such wry comedy and wit it is no wonder this book was so well received. Again, this is not humor for children or anyone with issues with profanity or adult situations, be forewarned. It is, however, unexpectedly amusing and gritty to an extreme.Enter the world of Eurotrash and gain some insight into the drug-singed minds of those depicted in The Acid House. You will never forget your journey there."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"I loved The Acid House. I've read each of the stories multiple times. Welsh takes you on an amazing journey with each of these stories, as the impossible becomes possible. Anything can happen, no matter how warped it is. Your mind is messed with, especially if you are in a drug induced state. The stories actually talk to you. They come to life. You know exactly what Welsh is talking about, no matter how deep he goes. He goes pretty deep, which makes you feel very intelligent since you understand it. The plot twists are genius, and surprise the hell out of you. This is one hilarious book, full of cynicism, irony, wit, mockery of humanity, and dead on reality. An inspiration to my own writing."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"The Acid House by irvine welsh is a superb depiction of the fears one has about the outcome of one's life. these twisted and beautifully articulated stories are written to fit any lifestyle perfectly. the way welsh uses the scottish vernacular is mind boggling and entertaining. i would read this book a thousand times over just for the enjoyment of learning to understand another culture's vernacular of my own language. my personal favorite storie in this novel had to be The Granton Starr Cause due to its unique and twisted ending. i must admit, this is the most quality novel i've read thus far in my existance."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Picked up without any expectations, or knowledge of the author, dazzled by interesting architectural arrangements of words while flipping through (LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT... in \\"The Acid House\\", title story, possibly the best as well), I am SO GLAD I found this book. And Irvine Welsh. Relentlessly honest, lasciviously poetic and descriptive, amazingly precise character insight and sympathy about the inner twistings of despair. I'm not quite articulate yet because I'm still high with excitement over this book, and I feel like I now have to read everything he ever wrote just to revel in the disgusting, glorious, cruel and beautiful human condition some more. The back-cover blurbs make him sound like a guttersnipe who miraculously picked up a pen to wield like a mighty fork into the marshmallow shat out by bourgeois Men of Letters in Europe, but Welsh is clearly a master of language. His skill is no accident. His deftness and cleverness is on par with Martin Amis, and his tapestries of profanity and rough vernacular better than anything by Hubert Selby Jr. or Louis-Ferdinand Celine.He isn't just sick and deranged for stylish effect, either -- or purposes of irony and shock -- as Chuck Palahniuk can be faulted for (although I'm a fan of him as well). Welsh is just DRIVEN towards this kind of stuff, possessed of manic energy to tell the stories of the people he knows and feels the most intensely (lower-class mangle-mouthed Edinburghers [Edinburgheans? Edinberghites?])... with a clear commitment to artistry and honesty. This is not a book to be skimmed for shock value, but one guaranteed to shock and jolt with the best kind of reality-consciousness, if you're willing to dive into it. My favorite stories are \\"Eurotrash\\", \\"Vat '96\\", \\"Granton Star Cause\\", and \\"The Acid House\\" -- but they're all good.So -- yes. Yes yes yes. Read Irvine Welsh. Revel in the filth, because it's pretty glorious. And deciphering that verbatim Scottish accent is worth every second of your time as well -- the characters are there, living and breathing and dying, right between your ears."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Welsh shows the entire language throughout the book which takes you into the world of the characters. Maybe hard to understand, the only reason for its lowered score, but like anything I was able to adjust easily and pick up the lingo. Humorous and delightful in its charming style, the characters were of reality making it easy to relate to."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This book is great for people with short attention spans, it jumps around so much it makes you want to keep reading. I couldn't put it down. I loved it, espesially the story about the head that was alive in a jar."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"A collection of twisted stories which will make you sick with nausia one minute and laughter the next. Gutsy, dirty and dark Irvine's literary genius wallows in a perverse but sincere reality. Recommeneded reading for headonists."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This is the second best book i've ever read!!(second only to Trainspotting!) The stories are told with great wit and understanding of the human experience. My favourite tale is the first one called &quot;The Shooter&quot;. The ending is truly a surprise! Just wait until you read it! Told with great passion and humour! This book deserves to be read by everyone on the planet!!!END"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Most of the stories in this book are tight, engaging pieces that stink of Welsh. Written in what seems to have become Welsh's formula for popular prose; angst, filth, depraved characters, weak plot twists... It still comes out to be an enjoyable read though, if a little lacking in real substance. The kind of book that has little real impact but fills the time in a nice way."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Though I had never read an Irvine Welsh book from beginning to end I love the movie of The Acid House and I'm forever quoting it. Being from Scotland and knowing some of the rascals portrayed so convincingly on screen I found it hilarious. I came across the book about 8 years ago and read some of the short stories, but I had never read it all until now.The Granton Star Cause, A Soft Touch and The Acid House were all dramatized for the movie but there are a few others that have enough merit to be made into live-action dramas. Eurotrash, for example, is a darkly repugnant story with a macabre twist ending. Snuff, the darkest of all stories, would have been amusing. And Snowman Building Parts For Rico The Squirrel seems like something straight out of David Lynch's dreams.There are a couple of duds though. A Blockage In The System goes nowhere fast and Wayne Foster is just plain confusing. The novella at the end however, A Smart C**t, is a truly grotty affair told from the point of view of the least likable man in history. It's a depressing experience filled with far too many characters with stupid names that have no personality outside of stereotypes, if that. I was thankful when it was over.Judging by the opinions of others this novella is similar to Trainspotting only not as vile. Well, I can assure you I will be staying well clear of THAT one. When I was in high school Trainspotting was the book of choice for all the idiots who didn't read but wanted something that they could relate to for their English exam. Most of those guys turned into alcoholics and junkies themselves.Sad fact that."},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"This book was killer! I fell in love, all over again, with Welsh and his simplistic yet brilliant stories. I've read all of his books and I have to say that I liked this one the best.

But then i spent the remainder absolutely laughing so hard it wasnt funny...if that is such a thing anyway , basically it is a damn good book, and you should all read it"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Some people write, other people try to write, Mr. Welsh creates a fantastic world. You never know what to expect next. Between learning a new language, and getting a new glimpse of life, Welsh gives something to the 20 somethingers of English the language that should never leave their sides, it should travel with them everywhere. Read it once, read it twice, read it until it falls apart and then buy another one, Simply amazing"},{"Title":"The Acid House","review":"Welsh, having delivered the standard bearing 'Trainspotting' has moved onwards and upwards with a bizarre, overtcollection of short stories.Each story in turn is delivered with a punch: not the merely a routine &quot;slap on the cheek&quot;, but a full-on fisted delivery tothe belly, leaving one winded, surprised, shocked and in wonderment of what coexists within the author's mind. Thearrangement of stories allows the reader to move from black to white and return to black via Welsh's vast and colourfulpalatte of that which surfaces from the tide of human suffering.There is something for everyone: love, passion, hate, transexuality, alcohol and drugs, the latter of which seems to bebecoming Welsh's trademark subject. In comparison, Ian Banks may do well indeed by haunting the reader with descriptive plot line andnarrative, but Welsh dispenses with tradition by cutting to the chase before you even have a chance to start your engines."},{"Title":"Civil War in the making, 1815-1860 (The Walter Lynwood Fleming lectures in southern history)","review":"Avery O. Craven in his slim collection of lectures in taking a more interpretive than narrative approach to the Civil War finds that the majority of people in the North and South were conservative and only reluctantly came to war. Unlike most historians, he believes that slavery was not the primary cause of the war. He admits in another of his books, \\"The Coming of the Civil War,\\" that his approach is \\"revisionist\\" but he said that his \\"effort in this book was to balance the picture, not to present a Southern point of view or to defend slavery\\" (vii). He believes that he was more fairly presenting the issues involved leading up to the war rather than accepting traditional, northern-centric biases.In his shorter book, he says that Lincoln's election precipitated secession because the South found that it must submit to Republican Party views or lose its way of life. He finds that the attitudes within that party justifiably gave rise to southern fears about its political domination and eventual abolition. Revolutionary changes in the North were based on its views of wealth and sin. He finds a cooperative management/labor paradigm shifting to an exploitative one in the new industrial North which led, in part, to condemning slavery as contributing to the problems of those exploited northern workers and farmers. Moral aspects in the North including religious revivalism combined with political reasons added to the party's antislavery stance which the South interpreted as primarily an abolition threat. Thus the disparate groups which finally made up the Republican Party gave southern interests valid reasons for worry over the future political power of the South and the concomitant threats to slavery.In the South where radical change was anathema, any thoughts of becoming \\"modernized\\" along the northern paradigm were viewed with horror. Attitudes therefore hardened in the South as well as the North and finally all of the abstractions boiled down to a very simple, but profound difference as expressed by Lincoln in 1860: \\"You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; while we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted\\" (67). Alexander Stephen's position maintained the southern right to slavery because the Constitution protected that property right and therefore could not be restricted.Craven emphasizes the anti-slavery debates in some southern states to make his point that before positions of the two sections hardened in the 1850's there was a substantial minority in the South which did not view chattel slavery as a positive good. But after the Compromise of 1850, the economic interests of the Northwest and Northeast united against southern interests paving the way for a clearer North-South conflict. Craven finds that the forces involved in creating the \\"Modern World\\" mainly after 1830 forced great changes and \\"these forces made long standing problems acute and clothed them with emotion\\" (85 footnote). The South could not accept a weakened colonial status and definitely not accept the impending social-economic revolution (86).I found Craven's short book thought provoking because it challenged my orthodox, northern-centric biases of the causes of the war. Unfortunately, due to the book's brevity, he was unable to include footnotes, a bibliography, or an index. His studying the origins of the war from a scientific perspective is an excellent way to search for more complete explanations for the conflict. I appreciated his intentional use of a southern perspective to help counter the standard northern-oriented perspectives which predominate."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"When I picked up this book, I thought it looked very good. I don't think however, I was quite prepared to be as impressed as I was with the work. It is not just a work about herbs and Witchcraft and their history, but a treasure trove of world cultural traditions and the folk healing modalities.As a professional herbalist, I was really very happy to see the amount of research and documentation that went into this book. It really delves into the European shamanic traditions and healing arts and folk religions attached to them. This is something, which is sadly quite lacking in alot of literature that is about \\"shamanism\\". So much of of it is a hodge podged mess of European and Native American practices and lots of urban legend. Not so with this book. You get a clear idea where the lines of the histories of Witchcraft and folk medicine practices got blurred and blown far out of proportion by way of legend and outright lies. And you also get an in depth look at how many of these plants were used. The authors pull no punches, poisons, halucinagens and abortifacients can be found listed in this book. I think this is the first time in many years that I have seen an herbal book which dared to list them, let alone discuss them. I also learned about some plants that I had no knowledge of before and I am always up for that! This, I believe is how Witches in the past truly practiced, and how many still practice to this day throughout the world. The focus however is on European Witches and Western herbalism.Witchcraft Medicine is clearly a scholarly work, but it it is not so much that the subject is at all dry and uninteresting to read. It was for me quite the contrary. I couldn't put it down! There is no relgious-centric slant to it at all. There are no sensationalist claims about 8 million Witches being murdered during the so-called Burning Times, for example. It's just lots of very straight facts, which is important. There may be a few nit-picky inaccuracies as far as mythologies, but when is there not? To be completely honest, there is a lot that is junk out there, and this book I would count among my top ten historical herbals on my personal bookshelf. This book is a very impressive body of work. Note that there are not really recipies or proportions as to using these now.EDIT: The Print Version is Better Than the Kindle Version:I stand by my original review of this book. It is an excellent guide into the herbs that are legendary within traditional witchcraft and shamanism. Cerrtainly, there are other books out there that will give you more how-to's than this one will as this one is a general, historical overview. As both an occultist and an herbalist, I think you can do far worse than a book like this one and Christian Rasch is probably one of the foremost authorities in the world on the topic of herbalism as it pertains to shamanic and witchcraft practices.I have the print version of this book and naturally because I travel a great deal and I want to have it available to me in electronic form, I purchased the Kindle version. One of the nice things about the print version are the wonderful watermarks of each page based on old witchcraft woodcuts, etc. Amazon, has not yet worked out all of the kinks in the electronic version for Kindle, so it is easy to feel as if you are being deprived of the many many images that are in the print version. I also own Chrstian Rasch's book, \\"Psychoactive Plants\\" in print version, however with the Kindle version of the same book being $60, I am going to wait until the technology catches up to where what is on my screen loooks closer to what I have in print form."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"This is a one of its kind book. While &quot;Mastering Herbalism&quot; put forth a lot of remedies and traditional folk uses of healing herbs, this is more about the history and folk uses of halucinogenic herbs, but also covers some traditional healing herbs as well. I found this book incredibly facinating, dry in spots, but otherwise difficult to put down. I highly recommend it, as well as &quot;Plants of the Gods&quot; and a good Peterson's Field Guide if you are going to attempt to find any of the plants listed in this book."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants by Claudia Muller-Ebeling, Christian Ratsch, and Wolf-Dieter StorlChristian Ratsch, PhD, the well-known ethnopharmacologist from Germany and his partner Claudia Muller-Ebeling, PhD, have come through again.This is a fantastic book on the history, botany and prohibition of witchcraft and shamanism throughout Europe.The book provides and excellent breakdown of both herbal and entheogenic plants used throughout Europe in medieval and ancient times. From Hawthorn to Holly, Elder to Elm, Belladonna to Mandrake, Amanita to Psilocybe, this book provides a well rounded foundation for understanding the healing plants as well as the psychotropic plants and their usage, symbology and worship and prohibition.The first part of the book written by Wolf-Dieter Storl is good reading, however it lacks the references and solid foundation that Ratsch and Muller-Ebeling provide in their sections, providing the reader with maybe a 1/3 of the amount of reference material as the other two authors. This left me wanting more proof for some of his proposals.Another problem with the book is that the authors should have collaborated together on the book as a whole instead of writing their own separate sections. Their own sections cause a little unnecessary repetition throughout the book and because of this, in some places, as one reviewer mentioned, information seems contradictory. However, the other reviewer took the meaning of removing the entheogenic substances from modern witches salves (which, without proper knowledge of their usage can be dangerous and poisonous) instead of in the context it was meant, when used with proper knowledge and care, is highly effective medicine, rendering modern, politically correct versions of these salves as ineffective.Over all, the book is a 5 star read. I was especially impressed with the history of the Inquisition and its impact on witchcraft and shamanism in Europe. The book provides new angles on understanding the Pharmacratic Inquisition that I had not really considered before.An excellent addition to any library."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"The authors of this book purport to tell the history of herb and plant use for religious purposes throughout history. They especially focus on plants that have hallucinogenic, healing, or toxic qualities.Only trouble is, I find it hard to trust the authors' word on how to use dangerous plants when they make errors so often in other areas. For example, they claim that Henry VIII had syphilis, passed it on to his children, and therefore none of them lived past infancy. Ummm...except for the *three* who grew up to rule England? And in a table of plants sacred to various Greek goddesses, they mention that the pomegranate is sacred to Hera, but do not connect it to Persephone at all, which seems a pretty big oversight in light of her myth.Then, they go on to talk about witches' flying ointments and how deadly they were--but ridicule modern witches who concoct less fatal blends to help them go into trance.There may very well be treasures in this book. I'd just be too afraid to trust the authors' accuracy."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"In doing research for my medicinal garden, I found this book in my local library. I wasn't sure what to expect with a picture of the painting \\"The Sorceress\\" by John William Waterhouse on the cover and a provocative title. I was pleasantly surprised. Witchcraft Medicine provides a well researched breakdown of both herbal and entheogenic plants used throughout Western Europe in medieval and ancient times. Originally published in German as Hexenmedizin: Die Widederentdeckung einer verbotenen Heilkunst--schamanische Traditionen in Europa, the text covers the history and folk uses of both hallucinogenic herbs and healing herbs. The book has three distinct sections, each authored by different individuals. Wolf-Dieter Strorl is a cultural anthropologist and ethnobotanist. Christian R&auml;tsch and Claudia Muller-Ebeling are German ethnopharmacologists.The first part of the book written by Wolf-Dieter Storl is interesting reading; however it lacks the references and solid research that R&auml;tsch and M&uuml;ller-Ebeling provide in their sections. This left me wanting more supporting arguments for some of his statements. His research tended to consist primarily of anecdotal stories of his field research. R&auml;tsch and Ebeling provide extensive source references in their chapters.The span of historical information ranges from the history of the Inquisition and its impact on witchcraft and shamanism in Europe to 20th century use of Absinthe and Coca leaves. There are numerous tables with correspondences of herbs and plants to specific god forms in Greek and Norse pantheons as well as plant lists associated with the gardens of Hecate, Medea, Artemis and Circe. The text includes recipes but I would strongly warn the reader that using entheogenic substances without proper knowledge of their handling can be dangerous and even deadly. Extreme care should be taken when introducing these plants to gardens since children and animals may accidently ingest the plant matter.The entire book is nicely illustrated with historical botanical drawings, medieval woodcuts and full color photographs of plant materials. The bibliography is extensive, citing both classical works and contemporary sources in both German and English."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"I have completed the enlightening task of reading Witchcraft Medicine and this tome of knowledge will be invaluable to my research and spiritual evolution!Bewildering numbers of herbs and deities are discussed, as is the history of the strategic demonization and persecution of herbal healers. Cannabis and other sacred sacraments are related to the gods and to historic texts throughout the book, including many wood-cuttings and even color photography. The author's have a tendency to describe in great detail some artwork that didn't make it into the book. I assume the problem was copyright law.Thank the gods this book was translated into English! The Great Mother Goddess is likely pleased."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"I Loved this book! It is actually my favorite book at the moment. I knew next to nothing about Germanic witches; Hexe, before I read this & I feel I'm better for the knowledge. The cross pollination of various magickal systems of belief throughout Ancient Europe & Asia is handled from a mostly Germanic perspective but reveals striking similarities to the stories of other \\"Heathens\\". This book clearly explains how early settlements carved out a place to live from the thriving \\"hedge\\" that densely covered Europe and how certain members of these communities (the old women) spent their time at the hedge picking the healing & love-inducing herbs whilst conversing with the intelligences inherent in them. As the ultra-destructive, monotheistic, anti-nature, \\"Desert\\" religions came bludgeoning through, (in the name of Peace of course) people were forced to see the natural world as evil & these women & their knowledge were vilified.My only problems with this book were; I wanted it to go on for at least double the length & the 1st half of the book treats Christianity as though it were an ancient religion in it's own right rather than built directly on Paganism- which it SO obviously was. Writing about the ever-baleful, \\"pure\\", Mary as a Goddess is EXTREMELY generous in a book that has it's largest chapter entitled \\" The Legacy of Hekate\\"- a Goddess of truly immeasurable antiquity & power who even enjoys a growing number of followers to this day despite the best efforts of the opposition. Circe, Medea, & Diana/Artemis are paid due respect as well and we get to visit the fiasco of mercury being used as a treatment by the French for their syphillis epidemic- which killed the patients after a tortuous bout of mercury poisoning but the good news is that they may have killed the syphillis in the patient/victim. Meanwhile, (according to the author's research) the Native Americans were successfully treating syhpillis with herbs (sasparilla I think) and ritual but the Europeans who had the herb sent back over to them could NOT duplicate the success- since their doctors didn't believe in the power of ritual.This book is merely 1 small part of the excellent argument for Western society acknowledging the importance of things that cannot be measured with rulers & microscopes or successfully controlled by dogma or fear of the Deep & Inescapable, Mighty & Awesome, Power of Mother Nature."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"I bought this book with some pretty high expectations.....A bit of a let down. All I can say is nothing new hear. The book gave a pretty basic over view of the intertwining history between witchcraft and herbalism. Those with a knowledge of Witchcraft 101 or higher I advise you to look elsewhere.The forest or the wilderness was at onetime home for human kind and believe me Europe was covered with dense forests. Man was a nomadic hunter moving to this place and that place with the animals he hunted. In time man mastered agriculture and learned how to domesticate animals. With this domestication man began building his villages and becoming alienated from the forests. A hedge surrounded the forest and it was in the deep dark forest where all sorts of scary things dwelt. To keep himself safe man grew a hedge around his village to keep the forest out and his family safe inside.The witch of the wise women used to live close to the hedge. They would communicate with the plant spirits and learn about different cures and how to work with the plants. The women were guided by the spirit of the plants. Wise women were respected and feared. To cure meant that one was able to poison.The earth was considered the mother, Frau Holle, who later would become demonized as an old hag in faery tales. The Horned God was represented by the sun or the sky and was the one who ploughed the field and placed his seed. The mother gave birth and received the dead body after life was over.The book does cover the mythos of witchcraft rather well. Christian Raatsch writes good chapters on Ethneogens and Hekate the Goddess of the witches. Reading his chapters did clarify things with regards to Hekate and her relation to the moon, Roman Diana, Prosperina and Artemis. I finally understood how Ayahuasca worked and the role of DMT and MAO inhibitors. Written throughout the chapters are lengthy descriptions of the herbs along with a wood cut illustration. I would rather see a photo.Baneful herbs like Aconite, belladonna, henbane and others were used by witches to astral project and get to the realm of the spirits. The church would later ban these herbs for their association with witchcraft and possession was enough to have someone prosecuted during the burning times. Still these baneful herbs had many medicinal uses that are over looked.The persecution started by the church and male dominated medical industry continues to this day. Backed by a staunch Christian mentality herbs like hemp, coca and a few others are outlawed despite the scientific proof demonstrating their health benefits. If someone does get intoxicated here and there like a drink after work what of it? It is wrong because someone chewed on a a coca leaf or smoked a joint. The witch scare continues under the form of a scare against drugs.Despite the over all good view of history and uses of various herbs the book would have benefited the inclusion of some herbal recipes, especially flying ointments which seem rather hard to find. The book could have also added in more historical details."},{"Title":"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants","review":"This book isn't just for witches.

First of all, there is no evidence of ANY matrilineal farming societies outside of maybe Native American, and that's CURRENT, not neolithic, so how can they say that? Regarding the linear pottery culture that the author put as 'the fifth century\\" which he should have put fifth MILLENIA BCE. and again, their matrilineal culture??? WHAT??? How does he know this? from pottery shards?Storl, you are fibbing! How about this... once again he states, on page 29 \\"All evidence indicates that the fields belonged to matrilineal clans\\"What evidence is this? Or \\"every settlement, every clan, had a white haired old woman to whom the ancestors and forest spirits or the Goddess(which one? do we know the names of their neolithic goddesses?) whispered many a secret\\" Okay... so that means 30 year old women who were white haired, held all the power, because in the Neolithic times, lives for women were short and brutal and 40 was a pretty spectacular age to reach.I hate this blatant stroking of new age women's egos in order to sell books. What is wrong with the truth? the herbal information looks okay, I've only skimmed, but with all the bulloney, the throwing around of authors like Duerr, who they must have barely read as they barely get near actually QUOTING the man, I am severely disappointed after reading the rave reviews.

Read on you will see other aspects or alternatives or reasons of failures of current health care system. I have heard thousands of times when very top level physician have explained that we don't know the root cause of ischemic heart disease and if we do then also there is no cure, hence some herbal way to help which should have no side effect.

This poem was written at the request of Oprah Winfrey to celebrate and commensurate the accomplishments of women honored at Winfrey's 2005 Living Legends event and ball. And the book concludes with a biographical sketch of each woman.These women, consisting of civil rights leaders, actresses, writers, singers, etc., are all role-models to those who followed and are following after them. A few featured are Maya Angelou, Ruby Dee, Nikki Giovanni, Dr. Dorothy Height, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and Nancy Wilson. Cleage's poem encompasses many of the known traits of these women, with themes of strength, sisterhood, honor, and courage, but also acknowledges their beauty and wisdom--showcasing them individually and also collectively. They are remarkable women who should be honored, cherished, thanked and most of all remembered. Kudos to Pearl Cleage and Zaron W.

Goodreading"},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names (Library Edition)","review":"Dr. Maya Angelou said \\"Thank you is what we say to God\\", when she humbly accepted the honor of being praised at Oprah's Legends Ball. The centerpiece of the event was Pearl Cleage's poem, which is lovingly presented in this inspirational little book.I had some problems with who Oprah honored and didn't honor, but I'll save that for when the DVD comes out. Anyway, it was her party and these were the people who inspired her.The beauty of Pearl's poem is that it is all about respecting our elders and remembering that we are AFRICANS! And we must be proud.I also like how Pearl asks the reader to adapt the poem to suit his or her own needs. We can use it as a template and praise the living (as Oprah has done) or the dead, women and men, African in America, or in Africa.What disturbed me about Oprah's bash was that most of the so-called \\"Young'uns\\", while claiming inspiration from the Legends, really don't seem to me that they will achieve much when they are of age. Many of them were flavor-of-the-week Black celebrities. I can only hope the event will truly inspire them to achieve something notable.In the early 90's, we had the group Arrested Development pushing the concept of honoring our elders and remembering our roots. THESE are the true Young'uns and they would be legends too, if they weren't so rudely thrown aside by the hip hop craze.I was also troubled seeing Jesse Jackson having another photo op, while Dr. Bill Cosby was noticeably absent. Mrs. Huxtable was there, but it wasn't enough for me. Cosby is leading the new struggle- for Africans in America to be articulate and educated.Bill Cosby, I SPEAK YOUR NAME!And this is why I love the poem so much. You can follow the African griot tradition and invoke your ancestors and celebrate your tribal elders. When you speak their names, they live forever, and inspire the youth.I also encourage young Africans in America to find legends IN Africa. Nelson Mandela is an obvious choice to start with. This way, we will reconnect with our mother country and be nourished by her sweet milk!Kudos to Pearl Cleage and thanks to Oprah, whose heart is in the right place."},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names (Library Edition)","review":"This little book is priceless! Inspired by Oprah Winfrey's vision to celebrate the accomplishments of extraordinary African American women, Pearl Cleage answered the call by penning the poem that was key to Winfrey's 2005 Living Legends event. Cleage drew inspiration from the honoree's accomplishments and with a line-up that included greats like Katheryn Dunham, Cicely Tyson, Toni Morrison, Coretta Scott, King, Diana Ross, etc., it was easy to pick a muse and let her imagination flow.The poem celebrates the spirit of sisterhood, courage, and resilience that these women possess. Pearl's signature themes of freedom, courage, wisdom, and strength (which are often echoed in her novels) are also evident in the prose. She marvels at how the honorees are a beautiful, mulit-talented group of women whose impact will be felt for generations; but more importantly she thanked and recognized each and every one of them (by name) as the truly amazing women they are. A brief biography of each of the twenty-five honorees is also provided in the back of the book.The poem makes for a perfect gift to friends, sisters, mothers and is a \\"must have\\" for any woman's personal library. Bravo - this is a wonderful tribute!Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names (Library Edition)","review":"In the spirit of Oprah Winfrey's Legend's Ball, We Speak Your Name is a brief compilation of African American women and their achievements. Ms. Cleage begins with a beautiful homage to women of strength and character. Reading the poem feels like a personal invitation, and the brief passages that follow are a guided tour through the amazing history of black women in this country and around the world. Ms. Cleage, in her introduction, tells us about her invitation to write, and she takes us along for the star studded ride to its glamorous conclusion. Her poem details the success, the sacrifice, the angst, and the adulation of women at the top of their field, and gives us insight on how they feel having reached that. Although she describes each legend in the short bios the follow, the passages are descriptions of these legends filtered through the lens of Ms. Cleage's profound perception, as a woman, as a griot, and as an accomplished author in her own right in awe of her sisters.A short book of less than 50 pages, this is a must have for all women. It is a perfect size to slip into a purse, as a stocking-stuffer, into a briefcase for that nerve-wracking interview, or a gift basket for a friend. However it is delivered, it is an amazing journey through history on the gentle but strong backs of those who made it.Brava!Reviewed By: Angela T.

Same melieu as \\"Black Oxen\\" by Gertrude Atherton, with society portrayed as shallow and money-grubbing, and the veterans wondering what they fought for. Interesting concept here that I have often thought; first time I've seen it in print - that love is some physical, if not tangible, thing, that we simply don't yet understand how to use. Book portrays three generations of New Yorkers, from the old pirate who made the wealth and built the house, to his three granddaughters, lost in the aftermath of the war, and the breakdown of morals. I truly believe all our ills today can be traced to the effects of this war on our society, the first war not directly touching American soil. Book has distinctly religious overtones, especially in the last sentence - a quote from Scripture. This was a best seller in its day. I reread it within four years and it was still terrific."},{"Title":"His children's children","review":"Arthur Train may not have been quite the Carl Hiaasen of his time, but Train's 1923 novel of New York society comes close, in its dry and witty, insightful and even rather suspenseful description of a family and a society spinning out of control.We follow three generations of the Mayne family through the year 1921-22. The 81-year-old patriarch reminisces about his rough beginnings in post-Civil War railroading, son Rufus rides rough waters as a wealthy financier, and his wife and three daughters muddle through their New York high society life. Parallels to today -- and clearly the seeds *of* today -- are inescapable: parents who pursue wealth, material goods and success; neglected children who run wild, then seek healing in drugs and cults.The way that this novel just misses greatness is super-frustrating! Train, as mentioned in the Amazon info, was a New York assistant D.A., and the sense of place is near-perfection. We've all seen film footage of the \\"flaming youth\\" era, but Train gives the reader a true feel for a society trying to recover from a war that basically ground the innocence of that youth into the dirt. Characters, both male and female, are complex and real.If I were rating it strictly as entertainment, I'd give it 4-stars, with the following reservations : it's often a fun read, even by today's standards, and a thoughtful social commentary. But some flaws keep it stuck in its time -- particularly the kind of casual racist comments that were par-for-the-course in so many early 20th century stories but are jarring and very distasteful to today's readers. A lesser flaw is the author's Victorian tendency to insert long descriptions and opinion-pieces. Even these can hold a lot of entertainment value, maybe more today than in 1923 -- the youngest daughter's coming-out party is a vivid, funny snapshot of Upper Crust real life under Prohibition.Some other descriptive passages are too talky but so insightful that 'His Children's Children' gets my highest possible recommendation, for anybody curious about the huge cultural changes of the post-World War One age."},{"Title":"The history of Napoleon Buonaparte (Half-title: Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys.

With an intro like that, I was very interested in reading the book and last night I opened it and wasn't able to put it down.I remember the story and of course the big thing was their diet; they ate the ones that did not survive. The authors did a fantastic job telling the whole story and putting that into perspective. This is also a great story on leadership, Marcelo, the initial leader that began to despair and lose hope so that in the end, survival fell to Nando and Roberto and the lessons on teamwork; if they had not primarily been from the same rugby team could they have managed to work together so well?.The book illustrates the Stockdale paradox from Good to Great, the optimists eventually lost hope, the survivors faced the hard brutal truth with unending unstoppable face. It is a tail of human endurance, to crash land on a glacier at 9,000 feet, to have so many die of their injuries, the cold, no food, no water when they finally get a camp established an avalanche buries them, to hear on the radio the search is called off and then to climb and unclimbable mountain peak with no mountaineering gear or experience.One of my favorite subplots was the discussion on faith. Most of the plane was Catholic of course and with death so very, very close at hand, their faith was tested. Some drew near to God, Suzy, critically wounded was constantly praying in her final days, others questioned God. I thought it interesting that there were no atheists. Death is the ultimate test of faith and more than one of the passengers uttered the phrase \\"I am ready\\".So, an overwhelming book, I will always be thankful to Gal for sending it to me and I am glad I read it and recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I picked this up somewhat randomly, and it is a bit of a departure from my recent \\"adventure\\" reading, since it is much more about surviving a disaster than about exploration. Perhaps because of that, I started reading it wanting the facts of what happened, how they survived, how they got out and what the climbing and hiking were like on the various efforts to get out. This book does not try to offer all of that. In fact, it's in ghostwriter Rause's acknowledgments that we read that the intent from the beginning for this book, written 34 years after the events described, was to complement, rather than to duplicate, the more fact-ladenAlive, written 32 years prior.That is not at all to imply that the authors got their facts wrong in this book. On the contrary, the facts seem well established, but the authors' focus here was elsewhere. In the ensuing three decades, Parrado had learned to speak to groups about the horrible experience, and this book captures his well developed personal narrative. It is the dashed hopes, lessening sanity, troubled faith and growing desperation of the group, and Parrado himself primarily, that are described most here. Knowing this, I can hear almost hear his voice describing the horrors then, humbly, their eventual, hard fought triumph and resultant reunions. It is clear that to hear him speak in person would not be easily forgotten.Had I known this deliberate choice of perspective, I would have readAlivefirst, then this. However, for someone like myself that knew nothing of this story and had not seen the associated movie or documentary, reading the well regarded third-party book based on early interviews of the survivors would have been a better first step and left me a little more patient to appreciate Parrado's introspection. He deserves nothing less, and I would suggest you follow the course of reading the other book prior to this one.Because this was written three decades later, the reader also gets the benefit of hearing how Parrado's life has shaped up (quite well, considering the thread by which it hung). The entire book is intensely personal storytelling, and I couldn't help but compare my life to that of Parrado -- not his struggle in the Andes but the stages of his life before and after the crash and escape. I can see why he can inspire an audience to reach for better than they have, stretch to be better than they are. I do not buy books looking for such reactions in myself but stumbled on a good one here."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This book tells the amazing survival of the \\"few\\" that made it after a horrible plane crash in the Andes.

Having both read the book Alive and seen the movie, this still adds sooo much to the telling of this story. The first person account and the insights garnered during and from the experience are spellbinding. The description of the experience is so well-written that it can easily be felt. The cold, the hopelessness, the overwhelming sense of helplessness... Nando IS a true hero though he'd be the last to attach that title to himself. Incredible imagery. It's also nice to catch up on what has gone on in the life of the survivors since the crash. The added details as to what happened upon being rescued also fed my curiousity. Marvelous book, must-read."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Nanda Parrado has written beautifully his insight to a horror no one could ever imagine.

Out of all the self-help books out there (not that this is categorized as one), this can help you look at whatever you're struggling with some sense of hope. \\"Everyone has their own Andes\\" is what this book's message is about. I could not put this book down. I found myself trying to put myself in his situation and how I would react. As I read this book I had this uncomfortable feeling of envy. I didn't know if that was the right feeling to have. How could you envy anyone who suffered so much? But I finally got it. I didn't envy his circumstances and all the ordeals he and the other passengers went through. I envied his strength, his courage, his willingness to keep going.

I think a lot of people were hung up on the fact that they had t o \\"eat\\" their fallen commrades as they were literallty starving to death. Many of us would not have the strength to do so. Or when we are still alive, offer our bodies to those around us so they may live if we die. One of the men actually did starve to death because he could not bring himself to eat another's flesh. Again, though, I like to look at their undying strength and love for each other.Nando Parrado is my hero as is the man that helped him hike down to bring all of the others the safety of airplanes.

It is truly a great and inspiring story. Of course it's a bit depressing at times based on the events but overall it's a great story of survival. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in survival stories and overcoming odds. In fact, after reading this book I was inspired to read \\"Alive,\\" and although I found it to be very good, this book was more readable and interesting."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I've watched the movie \\"Alive\\" many times but not read the original book on which the film is based. Nando Parrado's account of the surreal nightmare that became a stark reality for the passengers on that doomed Fairchild plane is nothing short of incredible. Parrado paints a vivid picture of his personal battles with the moral issues he was faced with. But it was his personal approach to the psychological and spiritual mountain he had to climb, in order to survive and tell the tale, that is the core of this story. After reading this book, you are left with a stronger feeling that there is indeed hope even in the darkest hours. Stories about beating impossible odds are far from unique but this story stands out simply because these events were thrust upon a pretty average young man who had no intentions to test the limits of human endurance in any particular way.I thoroughly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I was very familiar with the story before I read this book. I read Alive, saw the movie several times, and have followed the survivors and their lives for many years. Especially Nando's.Now - having said that - I was so unbelievably impressed with this book.

It is straight talk written beautifully.Thank you again Nando!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"THANK YOU Mr. Parrado, for this unbelievably moving account of your Andes survival ordeal, and life lessons taken from your exprience. I hope you realize that by sharing your personal story and views, you have helped many others see light in their own challenges and personal tragedies, including myself. I literally could not put this book down, and read it in one sitting in one day. This is a great plane crash survival story that juxtaposes survival, suffering, unimaginable tragedy, and the introspective 'life lessons' and philosophy taken away from such. It is very true that oftentimes, through great tragedy, challenge, and loss, we discover an increased appreciation for life and living each day to the maximum, which we often otherwise take for granted. This is easily one of the best books I have read in my 47 years. I could see this becoming required high school reading one day."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I'll preface this by saying I have not read Alive. I knew OF the story, but didn't know the details. I found the story itself to be quite moving. It has interested me enough to order the original book.I was disappointed in the writing and editing, however. There are several typos, and I got tired of \\"Once, for example\\", which has to appear a dozen times in one chapter. Parts of the book read more like a dictated conversation, which would have been fine if it was being sold as a documentary interview and not a nonfiction book. For my personal taste, there was a little too much \\"touchy-feely everyone was a hero in his own way\\". It ended up feeling forced, as if the Parrado felt he HAD to say something nice about everyone.That being said, I enjoyed the story immensely, and am amazed by what those who survived, and died while stranded, were forced to endure. I appreciated Nando's point of view, but wish he had chosen a better writer to illustrate it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I enjoy reading stories of mountaineering and survival,thus it seems inevitable that I would eventually read this book. I enjoyed the telling of the story of the crash and struggle of the survivors. Parrado does an excellent job describing the personalities, and conveys the human emotion of the situation very well. I took away one star for the last third of the book, where Parrado describes the remainder of his life after the crash and rescue. While he tried to explain how his experience in the Andes impacted the rest of his life, I didn't really see it. Read the story of his rescue; once he is reunited with his father the best part is behind you."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"\\"Miracle in the Andes\\" is a phenomenal and awe inspiring story of the human spirit, love, and ultimately of faith. As everyone else who has reviewed this book above, I too, have followed this story for years and have nothing but admiration, praise, and respect for Nando Parrado, for ALL the other fifteen survivors, and for those who perished. They turned what was a tragedy into a miracle.The only thing I have to add to all of the other reviews is, that when you read this book, your faith in God will be even more strengthened and inspire you to live every minute of the rest of your life with love, hope, and courage. If you don't believe in God, read this book and, I promise you, you will meet Him throughout every page in the many miracles that happen out of the many hopeless tragedies. Whether Nando Parrado sees it or not, the presence of God is felt and described by the author all over his book and helped give them all the strength to survive and get out of those mountains. For those who died instantly and those who were too seriously injured or weak to survive, God gave them peace in Heaven. For those who were still alive, God gave each of them the strength and courage to endure and the love and hope to find a way home. Thank God they survived, not only for their own lives and for their families, but to tell the world this amazing story and happening of a true miracle from a seemingly hopeless tragedy.This book is about one of the most inspirational stories of human courage and of God's miracles of faith, hope, and love you will ever read.

I was pleased to learn that Nando Parrado has become a speaker and has touched so many people with his story. He truly is inspirational. I give this exceptional book very high praise."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"... like Anthony T \\"Avid Reader\\" stated below, this too is my Book of the Year. And like Kang Kyung Hye from Korea states, why is this book not a bestseller? It should be. The original story as written in ALIVE was excellent narrative and now this book - the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the young men involved.And young they were. They survived without adult supervision.Nando stated it all in one sentence - every breath was another moment at cheating death. That's the scoop y'all -- death was always present at every moment. These men were fortunate to be able to function. The daily/hourly/minute-by-minute fear they lived for 72 DAYS had to be god-awful. I couldn't put the book down and in fact, reread it immediately because I could but barely digest the experience. I think the fact they were mostly all on a sports team was a saving grace for them. They knew how to pull together immediately and realized they had to do it fast. Who is to say an ordinary group of strangers could have achieved that?I give major kudos to Nando for writing it, equally major kudos to both Nando and Roberto Canessa for hiking out of that miserable place to attempt the rescue of the rest and frankly I give major kudos to all the men that managed to survive. I also respect those that didn't. Some that lived initially through the crash just didn't make it when all was said and done. Those were horrendously difficult conditions to heal injuries and broken bones.I encourage everyone to read this book. I don't write too many reviews, I think this is only my 4th one, but this book moved me to tears as I was finishing it. One man, one ordinary man one day became extraordinary when he realized how precious and short life can be. Don't you wish everybody shared that realization today?"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"From the dedication to the last sentence in Nando's acknowledgements, this book is a textbook on how to 'win against seemingly impossible odds.' Every high school teacher, student, and coach must use this book as a workbook for real-life lessons on confronting whatever is in the moment and focusing on taking action to determine the future. Nando dedicates this book to his wife and children and says he'd do it all over again if that's what it took to have them today. Wow! There are many books that profess the theory of love being the ultimate force, this one is practical. The Andes 'winners' (not just survivors) were 30 years ahead of their time. Many people are now organ donors, giving of themselves to help save others. These mostly teenaged boys showed unconditional love for each other that they did whatever they could to survive for each other and their families. I encourage anyone who wants to instill courage in someone to read this book and help them see that they can do anything for the love of their family. Rather than waiting until a critical incident happens in their life and then finding out about wanting to hang on for loved ones as an afterthought, use Nonado's hindsight as their foresight to put love of family up front. Then, whenever a critical incident occurs, saving loved ones from emotional pain makes you a rescuer (of them...whether or not they are part of the incident) rather than a victim. Nando and the other survivors created their own Miracle in the Andes!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"A riveting and incredibly well written saga. Rause and Parradohave written the book of the year.The prose has a quality of intimacy and anguish that will distinguish both of the authorsamongst their peers.Put down the self help books and read how a real man survives a real hell."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"In \\"Miracle in the Andes,\\" author Nando Parrado offers an intimate and personal account of the ordeal suffered by himself and others after the 1972 Andes plane crash made famous by the book and movie, \\"Alive.\\"The story of how 16 out of 45 people, most of them members of a Uruguayan rugby team, survived 72 days in the Andes in part because they ate the bodies of the dead, has been widely told. It was Parrado, more than any of the others, who saved them by pushing for, and then making, a seemingly impossible 10-day hike out of the mountains.While \\"Alive\\" told the grim facts of the ordeal, \\"Miracle in the Andes\\" takes readers deeper into the trauma and fear experienced by the survivors. This was especially true for Parrado, whose mother died in the crash and whose sister died of her injuries shortly afterward.\\"For me, those months in the mountains were days of heartbreak, horror and irretrievable loss,\\" he writes.After a slow start in which Parrado goes on for too long on his family's history (skim ahead), the book gains strength and draws the reader in. It's well-written, though I'm not sure how much credit goes to Parrado and how much to his co-writer, Vince Rause. Parrado seems reluctant to dwell too much on the cannibalism, but when he does he describes it simply as something they had to do to survive. Some in the group tried to justify their actions with religious reasons, but to Parrado the \\"meat\\" was simply nourishment.Despite the engaging writing, I found myself frustrated by how poorly the survivors of the crash handled their dire situation. They seemed to think that a helicopter would just magically show up and they'd be rescued. They did nothing to make their crash site more visible to rescue planes or make any extra effort to signal search aircraft.Nando, who was unconscious for two days after the crash, was troubled when awoke to see the attitude of the others. \\"It alarmed me that other were placing so much trust in the hope that we would be saved.\\"They took way too long to consider hiking out, and by the time they did, they were seriously weakened by starvation, thin air, brutal winds and freezing temperatures. They gave up too easily on a possible escape route to the east, which may have been better than the western route they ultimately chose.In fairness, the survivors were teenagers and young men with little to no experience in the mountains, no adult leadership and no survival training, so their missteps are understandable. It's just that in reading a story like this you want to root for characters who are doing all they can to help themselves, and it's frustrating when they don't.Still, there's other reasons to engage with characters and in this book it's Nando's sheer force of will and determination to get out of the mountains that is inspiring. He and his friend, Roberto Canessa, march over a mountain that would challenge professional climbers, and they do it with no specialized equipment. It is Nando's and Canessa's hike out that is the true \\"miracle\\" in this story.\\"It wasn't cleverness or courage or any kind of competence or savvy that saved us, it was nothing more than love, our love for each other, for our families, for the lives we wanted so desperately to live,\\" Nado writes.Throughout the book, Parrado describes how the survivors debated and agonized over the religious meaning of their situation. Would God save them, or had God forgotten them? Is there a God at all?, some asked. Parrado has no answers to those questions, but has no doubt the plane crash changed his life.\\"The Andes took so much from me,\\" he writes, \\"but they also gave me the simple insight that has liberated me and illuminated my life: Death is real, and death is very near. ... I believe that life should be enjoyed, but my experiences have taught me that without the love of my family and my friends, all the trappings of worldly success would ring hollow.\\""},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I am 27 years old and was not alive when the details of this absolutely amazing story took place, but I have always heard of how hard it was to believe what the passengers of this flight went through.

It is awesome on so many different levels.It is a story about life and death, loss, purpose, the will to live, survival, our primal instincts, courage, adventure - for real - it is hard to describe just how amazing this story is. If it was fiction - no one would ever accept it as being even remotely possible. Not only does Nando Parrado tell this story with such vivid detail and emotion, he humanizes every person on this epic journey.I thought Frodo and Sam did something amazing by destroying the ring and that Ernest Shackleton and his crew topped all true stories - but this is the single most amazing story I have ever read.Read it for yourself - it will change your life."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Having read Alive and seen the movie, I was hesitant to cover the same ground again, but my sister pressed Miracle in the Andes on me.

In the Epilogue he shares what each survivor-friend is doing today, and how his own life has unfolded as a result of the catastrophe and the publicity. Beyond this, he deftly tackles his spiritual journey without making you feel like you're reading a self-help tome.

Best book I've read this year.Greg JohnsonLewisburg, WV"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Most of us will never have to ask ourselves such a question, but at only 23 years old, Nando Parrado had to.We have all heard the story of the Uruguayan rugby team travelling to Chile by plane that met with disaster. The plane, unable to maintain its height because of severe weather conditions, collides with one of the sharp mountainous peaks. The plane is cut in two, one half plummets from the sky only to crash among the towering peaks of the Andes, while the other half--carrying survivors--hits the incline of a snow-covered mountain and dives deep into a valley. Those who survived the crash, look to the skies above, hoping and praying for any sign of rescue. With limited food supplies and limited clothing to shield them from the cold, they are forced to come face to face with the knowledge that they must act or they will die. Three brave men begin a journey--a gruelling trek that no one has ever attempted before, with only a glimmer of hope and no clear path to their destination, they set out to help their friends and save themselves. One of these men is Nando Parrado; Miracle in the Andes is his personal story.The first few pages of the novel walks the reader through Parrado's first moments after the crash as he wakes up and realises his gruesome predicament. He describes the cold as it first hit him, \\"burning his skin like acid,\\" making it hard to breathe, hard to move, and as a consequence even harder to live. Those first moments are terrifying, and the reader is right there with him, experiencing every chilling second. As the book progresses, Parrado reflects on his life leading up to the crash. Unlike Nando, his father was a hardworking man who worked long hours to make sure that his family could live the life that he did not. His father's philosophy was that all the good things in life have to be earned. Parrado talks about how his father tried to teach him this lesson, but he did not listen as he was more interested in girls and rugby than having to grind out a living. Yet Parrado must have learnt this lesson; how else could he have survived what he did?Written in the first person, Miracle in the Andes enables the reader to experience each long, excruciating step of Parrado's journey. It is an open and honest account of a tragedy and one man's struggle to survive. I would not recommend this book for in-flight reading! But I do highly recommend reading this book at some point in life. Miracle in the Andes is not just a story of survival; it is a story of the lengths a person will go to save a friend. The boys who were travelling to Chile to play rugby became men through their experiences. They should be thought of as heroes, an example to us all - \\"that anything is possible as long as you are willing to suffer.\\"If this book has any lesson for us, it is perfectly expressed in the last line: \\"Do not waste a breath.\\""},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I had the opportunity to meet Nando at a book signing here in Anchorage on Monday evening. Obviously tired from the promotional tour, he displayed great cordiality and personal warmth. A charming, modest, and self-effacing individual, he easily won over the entire audience. Having the opportunity to meet this man, who has been one of my heroes for over 30 years, was a wonderful experience and great honor.The book is a highly personal and harrowing account of the struggle to survive in an environment that made no allowances for life. Nando paints a vivid image of the experience that is amazingly deft. He describes the fear and anxiety that had an unrelenting grip upon the survivors, but also speaks of the majestic and awesome beauty of the mountain crash site. The book offers a rare insight into the survival process that guided the group through situations that permitted no margin for error. As Nando states very eloquently in this book, \\"the rules of the mountain were simple, play well or die.\\"During his presentation at the book signing and throughout the book itself, Nando continually expresses great love for his Father, family, and friends. This is ultimately a book by a passionate man about the personal application of love, loyalty, and sacrifice. A very inspiring and insightful narrative by a man who has endured and triumphed through experiences that most individuals would find unendurable."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Reviews by other readers says it all. I really cannot add much to their stellar reviews about the merits of this book. My question is \\"Why is this book not generating the kind of buzz that it deserves? \\" I've had the chance to review the manuscript and was convinced that the book would leap into Amazon top 10 within days of its publication. I blame the title. Everyone konws the facts surrounding this incident and with a title like that, I assume they automatically assumed \\"The Andes? A Miraculous survival? The Uruguayan team? Cannibalism? Oh, THAT story! What's more to know?\\" The original title was \\"The Opposite of Death is Love.\\" While that may be a bit too sentimental for some readers, I think it brings the story down to a more personal level and captures the one message that Nando wanted to convey when he decided to write this book after so many years.

While some great books can often be slow, confusing, or hard to focus on when recorded to CD, this book comes to life with a tense, gripping narrative that will keep you interested on long lonely highways.The author waited 30 years to write his journey and those years resulted in an excellence in tone, perspective, and self-reflection that writers rarely achieve in first person narratives. In addition to a riveting story, it offers a rich consideration of life, love, and faith without becoming overly sentimental or narcissistic.Let's put it this way. After reaching my destination after a four-hour drive, I sat for an additional 20 minutes in the driveway. I couldn't stop listening."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Anyone fortunate enough to come across this book will have this story rolling around in their head long after having read it. This is a story of courage and sacrifice coupled with teamwork that enables a Uruguayan rugby team on thier way to an exhibition match in Chile to survive a plane crash in the high Andes mountain range . The hardships at the crash site are seemingly insurmountable yet these young men manage to delegate themselves to tasks that ultimately result in their rescue an astonishing 72 days later. Nando Parrado, one of the principal survivors, tells this first hand story with grace, honesty and compassion.It is just incredible what these guys did to escape the hell they found themselves in. You won't be able to put this down."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Those who read Alive, published in 1975, probably remember most: plane crash, Andes, cannibalism (not necessarily in that order). Crash survivor Nando Parrado's attempt to revisit the harrowing, desperate situation and retell the story of forty-five people on an intended 3.5 hour trip from Uraguay to Chile that went bad, reads amazingly well. So much so, and seamlessly, that it seems the co-writer, Vince Rause, deserves more than the second billing he was given; his name printed in tiny font below Parrado's on the cover. With a bit of background, excellent descriptions of the goings on up to, during, and after the crash, the fight for survival, a devastating avalanche, and the attempts to hike out, Parrado and Rause have done more than one might expect. Three criticisms: Parrado's contention that he agreed to participate in a hike for help even though he knew it was futile; the awkward though somewhat logical interchangeable use of \\"my father\\" and \\"Seler\\" (his dad's name); and the word \\"miracle\\" used in the title, considering Parrado's account sounds neutral to negative on the concept of religion and divine intervention. His description of the first inkling of a seemingly obvious food source, \\"My gaze fell on the slowly healing leg wound of a boy lying near me,\\" [page 95] is haunting. Sensational but new (to me), the \\"meat\\" consumed by the survivors ultimately included the organs after the supply of muscle was exhausted. Dreams of his father, having lost certain family members during the ordeal, kept him going and the strong spirit of teamwork amongst the close-knit rugby players helped them achieve victory over the overwhelming obstacles they encountered. Sadly, the pilots, reluctant to continue on to the intended destination during a storm which had earlier forced them to land in Argentina, were prodded into their fateful decision by the vacation-hungry fliers and a looming limit on their allowed 24-hours of refuge in the country. One of the best-written books I've read involving an assistant author. Good companion reads: the original - Alive by Piers Paul Read, and Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"It was good reading and and interesting subject. There seemed seemed to be a repeat of ideas and memories. What happened to survivors was a nice touch."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I've always been intrigued by stories of survival - but this goes way beyond the physical accomplishment of defying the odds. The movie (Alive, 1993) told the story and I remember it well. The book also tells the story, but its lasting impact will be the lessons about recognizing the difference between being alive and truly living. A great reminder to keep things in perspective!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"In 1972, on Friday the 13th of October, a Uruguayan plane crashed in the mountains. If that wasn't bad luck enough for the 29 who initially survived, the last message the pilot radioed was his false belief that they had passed Curic&oacute;, Argentina. Now the radio didn't work, authorities had no idea where they went down, and the plane's white roof blended in with the snow. At 12,000 feet altitude, sparse oxygen, sub-zero temperatures and a complete lack of animal or plant life compounded their problems.For the first three days, a head injury kept the author of this book, Nando Parrado, in a coma that convinced his friends he wouldn't live. But two months later, he got them rescued by making a 10-day trek out of the mountains with fellow survivor Roberto Canessa. Those who lived only hung on through a reluctant decision to eat the dead after they ran out of anything else even resembling food.I just finished reading Parrado's Miracle in the Andes, and I've read an older account (Piers Paul Read's Alive) several times, usually coming back to it in tough times. Survival stories are so powerful, but the question of eating the dead adds even more drama to this one. When death comes to your doorstep (and, as Parrado says in this book, \\"We all have our own personal Andes\\"), will you fight to survive, or will you give in to fear and despair? Reading this hero's true story prepares you to be strong -- and inspires you to savor every moment of life."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I have followed this story since it happened in 1972.I have read everything written and watched TV specials.I attended both movies: Alive, and the Mexican version, Survive.But nothing can compare to the book by the actual person who wasthere.

I enjoy reading books about people who have been through extreme circumstances (true crime, survival) and this definitely fits the bill. I know \\"Alive\\" came out first but I read this book before I read \\"Alive\\" and I feel this book is superior because it is a first-hand account. Even if you have read Alive I still suggest this book.

However the rest of the book easily made up for the less interesting section.Overall, it's a story that grips. You become very aware, as you read about Nando's desperate life/death struggle, that you are sitting in your comfy armchair, instead of freezing in the snow. And you really feel the action. I found myself doing a lot of thinking as a result of this amazing story. If there was a higher star rating, I would give it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I read Alive! when it was published back in the 70s.

While \\"Alive\\" is an excellent book and I heartily recommend it, Parrado and Rause do a wonderful job of making the story tangible through this wonderful personal narrative. I was frequently moved to tears by Parrado's account. My recommendation to anyone would be to read \\"Alive\\" first for a thorough overview of the facts (as well as details of the efforts of the family member's efforts to conduct their own search,) and then follow up with this book.But if you're going to read only one book chronicling this extraordinary story, make it this one."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"If you're not a reader who is easily reduced to tears; if a visceral emotional reaction to a true-life story of hopelessness finding redemption doesn't sound like you, I dare you to read this book. And if you think this is a story primarily about a plane crash and desperate measures toward survival, you would be wrong. Read it from beginning to end and 'round about the middle of the final chapter you'll know precisely what's going on in this wonderful memoir by Nando Parrado. This generous book is a remarkable lesson for any human being who either \\"knows love\\" or wishes they did."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"In a nutshell, the book describes an extraordinary experience, an exceptional display of fortitude and grit, and more importantly, one man's life lessons from the experience that can be shared and used by people all around the world.The book was written pretty well and managed to keep my interest over the course of the passengers' 72 day ordeal. Although some passages were quite ordinary, perhaps because of the timelessness of the experience (cold, fatigue, thirst, hunger, boredom, etc.), there were other passages that were simply fantastic. More importantly, Parrado's thoughts on the experience and what he has taken out of it are what make the book truly worth reading. It is one thing to read of their experiences and try to evaluate each of the survivors based on their fortitude and endurance shown during the ordeal. I think it is as important, if not important, to see how the ordeal shaped their subsequent lives and their outlook on life."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I never have read \\"Alive\\" (or seen the film of the same title), but I'm skeptical that it could rival the quality of this book. Nor could it possibly give the kind of insight into what it was truly like to struggle for survival while watching friends die that only a survivor could express.This book is extremely well-written and captivating. I read it once to myself and then aloud to my husband (he can read just fine but enjoys being read to, especially when we're camping), and I was just as hooked the second time through."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I was very impressed by this book, it was a very detailed account of this disaster and miracle, that I never saw in the movie.

I was not disappointed.Nando Parrado, reflecting back over a span of thirty plus years, shares his experiences with the reader. At twenty-three, as a young Uruguayan high on life and flying to an exhibition rugby game in Chile, he was master of his universe, when the unthinkable happened. The plane carrying his family, friends, and teammates, suddenly crashed onto a glacier deep in the Andes Mountains. The crash killed many of those he had known and loved, including his beloved mother and sister. Life as he knew it was over, and from its ashes a new Nando Parrado was born.Before the crash, Nando had lived a comfortable, privileged life and was more of a follower than a leader. Yet, as their situation on the mountain became more desperate and death seemed a certainty for all of them were extraordinary measures not taken, Nando rose to the challenge, emerging as a leader in the unlikeliest of circumstances. In a desperate bid to save his life and that of the other survivors, an emaciated and ill-clad Nando, together with his friend, Roberto Canessa, climbed an unknown peak in the Andes, and trekked over forty-five miles across frozen terrain to seek help for the remaining survivors. How he and Roberto did this is the stuff from which legends are made. It is simply an extraordinary and riveting story.In his reflections and reminiscences, Nando explains the impact this singular event had on his life and how it shaped him into the man he became. It is a story well-told and one worth reading. Those who love memoirs and true life adventure stories will find themselves riveted to the pages of this book. It is little wonder that this book has become a New York Times bestseller."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I couldn't put it down after the first 50 pages. This is an amazing true story of a life changing experience. Tragedy, brutal conditions and the best and worst of raw emotions. If you've seen the movie and read Alive, this book is still worth a read. I'm sure every one of the survivors has a different perspective and take on the experience of some aspects of the events."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"If you like survivor stories, this is one of the best ever written. Even though I read \\"Alive\\" many years ago, this book brought new and detailed descriptions from, in my opinion, the person who practically single-handedly saved the rest of the team who hadn't perished after two-plus months on the mountain. Parrado's writing is superb. Since the plane crash happened over 30 years ago, he brings great insight and introspection and detailed updates on his fellow teammates and their accomplishments in the intervening years."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"After reading an excerpt of the book in a outdoors magazine, I knew I had to buy and read this entire book. I am not a frequent reader, and I feared that I would end up buying this and not finishing it as I so often do. But I knew just a few pages into the book that I would finish it. I had too many questions that I knew would be answered if I finished it. The only real certain part(having never seen the movie 'Alive!') was that Nando would make it out, since he wrote the book. But past that, I had no idea who would and wouldnt survive and the series of events about to unfold.I was absolutely riveted. As said in other reviews, I couldnt put it down. There never seemed to be a good stopping point, Because you always wondered what the next step would bring.Its an amazing story, but not just of survival and the human will to live, But of one mans struggle with the meaning of life and the acceptance of death, and his own discovery that the opposite of death is Love. Remarkable on every account, great detail without being pointlessly gruesome.I recommend this book to any reader of just about any age 13 and up, or somewhere near there. The only concern would be language.My only disappointment was the details AFTER escape. There was a nice summary of Nando's life as a whole, but very little about the crash site, what was removed, what was left, What is in the pile of debris that makes up the memorial on the mountain, whether or not the survivors left behind during his 10 day hike DID have to rely on their 'last resort' (discussed the moment he left on his final hike, I wont spoil it for would be readers). I also would have liked a more definitive time-line to help make it easier to follow. Perhaps a full break down at the end of the book of the intial crash and who was lost immediately, and then each person and on which day (or a close estimate) of when they died., more detailed layouts of the landscape and the crash sequence, and perhaps mopre photographs printed that were taken with the instamatic camera they found. And do any items exist today? Such as the sunglasses made from plane visors and copper wire and things of that nature.But all in all, These are small details that dont detract from the book overall. I give it a strong 5 stars, and will probably read it again to catch any small details I may have missed. Truly amazing in every way."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Like the reviewer before me, I thought little else could be said about the plane crash in the Andes. I am a huge fan of the movie but...Wow! Personally, I think this book should be manditory reading for every 16 year old in America. I have to say I could not put it down. I am forcing my husband to read it so that I can discuss some of the revelations with someone! It takes a superb story for me to fly through a book like I flew through this one. I am actually re-reading the beginning chapters because now that I am crystal clear about who everyone is, I feel I need to re-read what was said about them earlier in the book when I was racing through for plot details. If you can only read one book this summer, this is it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is an incredible book - probably my top read of the year (so far).I've never read Alive- I was put off by the thought of the cannibalism that was reported. But this book is not sensationalized at all - in fact, it's the exact opposite. This is a compelling read, a true-life adventure story as written by the \\"expeditionary\\" who treked from 12,000 feet out of the Andes and into Chile when it became clear to them that they wouldn't be rescued, and were responsible for saving their own lives.This book is a tribute to the amazing resilience of the human spirit - what a person can endure when pushed beyond their limits. It's also a tribute to the love of a man and his family, which is what kept him going for months, just to survive. This story has been written over 30 years after the events in the Andes mountains (in 1972). It tells of the survivors' lives since the crash, and draws conclusions about how and why they survived. It's a marvelous tribute to life.If you enjoy tales of outdoor adventures, or stories about man overcoming great obstacles, do yourself a favor and read this book. You won't soon forget it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"One of the best books I've read in a very long time - very well written.

I had read ALIVE and thought I already knew the story, as it had been told in detail.Boy, was I blown away! What an amazing surprise MIRACLE IN THE ANDES turned out to be!Nanado Parrado very skillfully and gently takes you into those mountains with such vivid images and heartbreaking exchanges of dialogue, that you 'feel' the immense cold, your stomach actually churns with their hunger, and your body aches with an emotional empathy.The calm camaraderie of these astonishing young men amazes with their awe-inspiring courage!The reader comes to know and care about every man and woman caught in this horrible nightmare of survival at it's bleakest.So many times throughout the novel, just when hope was gaining or plans were coming together to find a 'way out', a devastating set-back would occur. As hope was dashed once again, the spirit and love of these stranded survivors would not diminish....and another plan was carefully thought out.Everything in their lives was re-examined; their faith repeatedly tested and the bonds of brotherhood strengthened beyond belief!This riveting account is sure to elevate and illuminate faith in the love that shines the light on their 'miraculous' journey.Suz"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I plowed through this wonderfully written book in a few days by stealing brief moments in parking lots, at restaurants, in the driveway of my home and waiting in line at stores. I could not separate myself from the book or the book from my mind. Nando Parrado, through the writing skills of Vince Rause, extracts incredible insights from the many horrors he and the other survivors faced in the Andes.What separates this book from others in the same genre (Into Thin Air, Left for Dead, Touching the Void....) is that Nando and the others did not willingly place themselves in the situation. They were not experienced mountaineers with expensive technical equipment who trained for years to scale a mountain only to have things go wrong. They were ordinary people who literally dropped out of the sky into the worst situation imaginable. This book puts the reader on the mountain with him and the other survivors and lets you know that it is possible for people like us to overcome incredible odds.This is my Book of the Year."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I already knew the general outcome of this story, but couldn't put the book down!

He is kind, hard working and never seems to loose his cool.In this book, he tells us the story 30 years after the airplane crash in the Andes. We hear of his terror of the mountains, panic at being so trapped, impatience to escape, and horror at the death of his mother, sister, and friends. As we hear this story from his heart, a different Nando emerges.He tells us the story of the climb up the mountain, which had they only known better, was impossible. It was a technical climb at high altitude better attempted by well equipped mountaineers than by boys in street clothes and rugby boots. And yet they climbed it and walked out and have lived to tell about it.He tells us of his efforts to remain calm and not succumb to panic, such as after the avalanche kills a number of the survivors. We learn of his focus on saving energy, \\"tears waste salt\\". He uses many skills to remain focused throughout the entire ordeal in the mountains. [A study of those skills makes the book worth reading by itself.] But like everyone else there comes a time when he, too, looses his cool.He tells of the web of values and experiences that he took into the mountains, of his parents love and teaching. He tells us that when all else is lost, it is love of his father that keeps him going even though he is convinced that he will die in the attempt to trek out.He tells us of his weaknesses and the heroism of the others, both those who lived and those who did not. He tells us of the strong bonds between individuals and how they \\"made each other better men\\".He tells us of the cold so intense it burns, the thin air and the brutal magnificance of those huge mountains. What a cruel enviornment it is for people who have never seen snow before.In the end all of the victims and survivors seem more human and more heroic.As for Nando, he emerges as more complex, more compelling, more generous, and somehow more convincingly human than one would have expected. Love becomes his centralizing value and theme. And, somehow, his telling of this story becomes an act of love.That in itself is astouding and courageous and could only have been do by someone who is living his message. It is a privilege to read this story.For those not familiar with the story I would suggest reading ALIVE! 1st. But if you are interested in humanity, survival and especially, love: READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"In Chapter 1 of \\"Miracle In The Andes\\" author Nando Parrado discusses what life was like for himself and his teammates on the Old Christians Rugby Club prior to that fateful October day more than thirty years ago. This was a pretty close knit group of guys who took their rugby very seriously. These were strong and affluent young men with their whole lives ahead of them. In October 1972 the team had scheduled an exhibition match with a club in Chile. And so it was the Old Christians Rugby Club of Uruguay along with a small cadre of family, friends and fans were traveling close to the Andes on a small private aircraft when disaster struck. The plane had veered off course and visibility was poor. At first there was turbulance and then a frightening tremor that rocked the airplane. Moments later those who had been lucky enough to survive the terrible crash into the snow and ice and rock began to understand the magnitude of the forces of nature they were up against. They had come to rest in a bitterly cold and incredibly desolate place somewhere in the God forsaken Andes mountains. There was no food and seemingly no way out. It appeared that their only hope for survival was a successful rescue mission. Sadly, that outcome was not to be.Without a doubt, \\"Miracle In The Andes\\" is one of the best books I have read this year. Author Nando Parrado was one of the survivors of this deadly crash. Nando was in a coma for three days after the crash and when he finally awoke he learned that his mother was dead and that his sister was badly injured. As I recall 18 of the passengers were killed instantly and several more including Nando's beloved sister Susy would die in the days and weeks ahead. But \\"Miracle In The Andes\\" is not about death. It is all about life and the will to live and press ahead. It is a story about resolve and teamwork and ingenuity. The survivors were ordinary men who found themselves in an extraordinary set of circumstances. What makes a story like \\"Miracle In The Andes\\" so very fascinating is that none of us have any idea how we would react in this kind of situation.The compelling saga of \\"Miracle In The Andes\\" and the survivor's epic 72 day ordeal in the mountains will grab your attention immediately and never let go. The physical agony and psychological pain this group was forced to endure is literally beyond comprehension! It is not often that readers get a first hand account of such an extraordinary event. Nando Parrado turns out to be a very gifted writer who sprinkles the main story line with personal observations and reflections. When Nando and Roberto find help and the rest are finally rescued you will want to stand up and cheer. It is a story you will never forget! From now on whenever I feel discouraged or overwhelmed by life's burdens I will think of them. \\"Miracle In The Andes\\" is an extraordinary book that you will not be able to put down. Highly recommended for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"It is hard to imagine a memoir about the rugby team's crash in the Andes that would top the book \\"Alive\\", but the story was so intriguing I wanted to read about it from a first person point of view.

I was pleased to learn that Nando Parrado has become a speaker and has touched so many people with his story. He truly is inspirational.

It's a different book altogether, so if you read the first, read this one too.Even if you haven't read *Alive*, read *Miracle*."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I read the Spanish version of this book. This is the account of what Nando and his fellow survivors lived through that accident. The book is very interesting not only because it describes what they went through, but what they thought, suffered and wished for, to choose life over giving up to death ( a not so obvious choice in the conditions they had to endure). This book is not only \\"interesting\\" but a lesson for life and love. It was also hard to put it down.

This is one not to miss."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is an incredible story of survival, courage, and determination. Nando Parrado does the seemingly impossible, and it took my breath away. I had read \\"Alive\\" many years ago-a \\"report\\" of the same events written by Piers Paul Reid. Originally I thought this book would not add much. Because Parrado was actually one of the survivors, however, his personal thoughts, feelings, and perspective added a special depth to this amazing story that I would not have missed for the world."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This captivatiing story of Nando Parrado's trek through the Andes is a must read.

It was a story that haunted me and stayed in my memory for many years. As I came of age, I wondered what had become of the two \\"expeditionaries\\", Nando Parrado and Roberto Cannessa, who traipsed their way for 10 days out of the wreckage of the fuselage of the wrecked Uruguayan Fairchild and through the Andes to freedom and rescue. It was then, a great thrill, to have Nando and Vince Rause write this awe-inspiring followup 30 years later. The factual chronology that Read used were incredible, but this firsthand account takes the story to a different, more personal level. His daily struggle to survive, both physically and spiritually, are nothing short of extraordinary. To paraphrase Nando, the opposite of death IS LOVE. This is a book that makes one believe it and seek to live it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I almost overlooked this one as I had thoroughly enjoyed Alive by Piers Paul Reid, many years back. However I decided to chance it and I am so grateful that I did. Nando is a gifted raconteur and this survival tale is exceptional . Though above all it cannot be questioned that without his strategy and toil the survivors would never have been rescued, he shares the \\"glory\\" if I can even use that word- with all of his team mates. He is an inspiration, a reluctant hero forced by circumstances to use every iota of power that he and the team members possessed to figure out a path of survival. Although he endued such loss and pain, Nando still found a way to realize a happy fulfilling life after this cataclysmic event of his youth."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Very good indeed.

This book was very thought provoking and I couldn't have asked for a better book to read. It was one of the best books I have ever read. I usually find non-fiction books to be boring and long, almost never ending. But when I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down. Thought some small parts of the book seem to carry on about the character's life before the accident, it was still very useful information and also very interesting at times.I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially teenagers and adults.

Just as an incredible story of survival, it is truly awe inspiring. But the story also provides the necessary context, and the catalyst for, the author's philosophical and religious beliefs - which are presented gently and completely respectfully. There is nothing even close to preachy or prideful in this presentation. I found it to be incredibly articulate in that you can understand where there author is coming from - just an awesome presentation.

The book doesn't quite live up to hearing him speak but it is interesting. I don't know if it is a cultural difference, a man/woman thinking difference or just people are different but I couldn't really relate to his mindset about what the entire experience meant. Now I want to read Alive, the first book written shortly after the accident in 1973 to see how it compares."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I just finished reading Piers Paul Read'sAlive(1974) a few days ago, and so fresh with names, maps and time lines, I had high hopes \`Miracles in the Andes\` would add a new dimension to this amazing story. Unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed, all the more so given the generally good reviews \`Miracle\` has been getting. It is perhaps inevitable in the shadow of Read's classic masterpiece that anything else will pale in comparison. The re-telling of events from Parrado's perspective is interesting but misses a lot - for example he was in a coma the first three days of the accident - and he doesn't seem to add much that is new to Read's version - which almost without exception is better told.Beyond a retelling of the events, I had hoped Parrado would reveal something new about himself and the other survivors, but instead if often read like hagiography, glossing over the differences among the group to show them as united friends, discounting and minimizing character defects. It reminds me of how the Catholic Church writes history of saints, and it is probably no coincidence that the survivors were from Catholic backgrounds, and saints in the minds of true believers who saw the hand of God at work in this \\"Miracle in the Andres\\". I was hoping for a more in depth psychological examination of the survivors, a sort of personality x-ray to bring them to life, to intimately know them as friend or brother. Instead there is a polite respectful distance, which is frustrating, given the intimate nature of the experience.Despite these sentiments I still recommend the book to anyone who has read \`Alive\`. Parrado's inner struggle with life and death - while not exactly original or new - is profound and worth the reminder of what is important. There are also new pictures, and an Epilogue with brief bio's of what happened to the survivors after the rescue to the present day. Whatever the faults, as the men age, and the myth grows, more books and films will appear to hopefully peel back more layers behind the \\"Miracle\\" in the Andres."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This story is amazing, more so since it's true.

So far, i will not recommend this book"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This book arrived at my doorstep a bit belated (9:00 p.m., via my landlord), and by my own self-imposed 1:00 a.m. deadline, I was 160 pages in. I had finished this book by the next evening. That is the power of this narrative.My first introduction to this well-known story was \\"Alive\\", as it was for many. My first reading of this tale started on a Boy Scout camp-out 22 years ago, and my young curiosity and the absolute desolation and peril experienced in those pages was riveting (several of us young men gathered around a flashlight reading, refusing sleep as the story unfolded, trying to imagine \\"what if WE were up there?\\"). What shined through in that tale was the sheer strength of will, spirit, and courage those young men and women exhibited. Reading Nando's story after many years was like returning to a desolate, yet inspiring place I had only imagined, experienced vicariously, yet had been deeply moved by.Now, I had Nando's take. Now it was First-person; now it was all of the racing thoughts and doubts and anger; now it was made more private, yet more real. Now I was given a peek into the thoughts of desperation and hope, and now, after reading, I have a deeper understanding of how the mind and soul often harbor deeper strength than we realize; how something as simple as love can survive even as doubt nearly triumphs.Nando doesn't attempt to answer the big questions; his experience fundamentally changed how he saw life, faith, and destiny, yet he refuses to offer his trial to the will of any single deity or mysterious fate (a point of difference he still shares with some of his brethren from the mountain). His ordeal forces him to question every tenet that he previously took for granted. His power and motivation, ultimately, was simply his love for his Father, and the strength that such a power can have is the motivating force of an incredible story.This story IS simply one of the best survival stories of our time. Do not pass up this book. It will make you cry, it will make your heart surge, but most of all, it will make you question.Could I do the same?"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"If you think you have it tough, pick up Miracles in the Andes. It is simply one of the most inspiring books you will ever read. It moves along very quickly. And as good as Alive is, Miracle in the Andes is even more enjoyable and enlightening because it reaches into one man's mind and heart in exploring those hard-to-define characteristics that some people have in survival situations. That said, you don't have to be a fan of the survivor-story genre to enjoy this book -- just a fan of life itself."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"An amazing story that I couldn't put down! I was awestruck by the sheer impossibility of anyone surviving. The most striking moment was under the avalanche in which Nando surrendered his life and was ready to die.Their courage and instincts for survival were amazing. The message I took away is that love can inspire a person to do miraculous things and that God is too distant to rely on or understand. While I myself am a strong Christian, I still enjoyed the story. Finally, the book was well written with inner monologues and background and mixed with just enough detail to keep the story moving along. I highly recommend this book to any adventure/survival story lover, or anyone who wants to ponder the human spirit."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I loved this book so much I lent it to family and friends.

This book captures the emotion of the Andes experience through the eyes of Nando Parrado. He seems to leave nothing unrevealed. For anyone who \\"enjoyed\\" the movie Alive, yet wants a truer account, a fuller account...this book is wonderful! The highlight is listening to Parrado talk us through his mental and physical journey as he and Canessa risked everything to escape the mountains and save themselves. These events were mostly glossed over in the film Alive. Yet, the trek out of the mountains is arguably the most inspirational, miraculous part of the entire ordeal. A potentially life-changing book. It's up to you really..."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is an excellent book. It describes an unfortunate event/airplane crash of the Uruguayan Rugby team on October 13, 1972 high in the Andes, and their astonishing survival, the hardships they had to endure and their long, excruciating trek out of their ordeal, written superbly using lots of adjectives and action verbs. As you read through the pages, you can actually picture what was happening, down to the last detail. I've only started to read the book and I'm already totally captivated. Don't hesitate buying this book or giving it as a gift. It's a great choice.

I recommend it to anyone who stands still long enough for me to shout, \\"go get this book!\\" I'm not a fan of self-help books, and this isn't one, but heck, it should be because if this doesn't make you take stock of your life, stop whining, and start living, than nothing will.One of my favorite things about it was seeing how much a person's personality dicates how they'll handle adversity - this book has take-charge-bossy types, as well as curl-up-and-give-up types, and oddly enough, the one who adapts best is the take-life-as-it-comes type. I went camping with 14 friends a week after reading this, and saw all personality types and secretly rated them all on how they'd have done in the Andes. ;-)Read it, and you'll never complain about your life again."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I have passed this book around to family members and all were enthralled by it and impressed by the man nando was and has become."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I echo all the encomiums and accolades.

Scary and heroic and entertaining all at the same time. You won't believe the story unless you read it straight from a survivor. Not only a survivor, but THE survivor who walked more than 70 miles with one other person until they reached help. 72 days in the Andes, thats the only fact you need to know to want to open this book and read it.Easy read that takes no time to read. Highly suggested"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I read Alive by Piers Paul Read when it came out in the 70s and never forgot the terrible, life-affirming story. A few months ago when I read that Nando Parrado, one of the heroes of the book, had written his own book about the plane crash and miracle of survival, I re-read Alive, just to familiarize myself with the details.I bought this book by Nando Parrado as soon as it became available, and at times thought that it was a repeat of the Piers Paul Read book, but then began to realize that the facts are what they are, and that Nando Parrado's book is filled with much more than just facts; most of all it is filled with heart.The horror of the crash and the brotherhood of the survivors is unsurpassed in human survival accounts. I would rank Parrado up there with Shackelton and maybe a couple of other early explorers: men with grit and honor, able to see beyond the horrific facts of the unexpected circumstances they find themselves in. Because of Nando's and Roberto Cannessa's determination to not die on the mountain, and to not let even one more of the survivors perish, the miracle of the book's title occurrs when they walk out of the mountains to get help for the other survivors, who, for a variety of reasons, were unable to save themselves. Parrado's account of his very real struggle, fear and dread is bone chillingly real, but along his trek through the Andes he has fortitude and foresight, and in the realization that no human had ever climed the mountain they were on, he named the tallest mountain they traversed for his father. It is my fervent hope that the name Mt. Seler has stuck and will be printed in history books and on maps from now on.Parrado says he and the other survivors have made the unconscious decision to not let the plane crash define them, and have all moved forward with their lives for the sake of their families as well as for their own peace of mind. They are to be commended for that; however, the world would not have come to know them were it not for the accident and the miracle in the Andes. I am proud to have met these men through the pages of this remarkable book. It is truly a Masterpiece.June 22: I am editing my review above, having just finished Terri Jentz's book, Strange Piece of Paradise. Her book also tells of a horrific event that befell the writer, also in the 70s, but there is a huge difference between that book and this one: Jentz has never gotten over her trauma, in fact would appear to be stuck in it. It bothered me. Her book was overly long and exhausting in the extreme. And compared to Miracle in the Andes the event she experienced was very strange, but almost trivial in comparison. I have added the paragraph below to this review ....Once read, Miracle In The Andes will never be forgotten, not only for the courageous story that is told, but because of the man writing the book. Nando Parrado has to be the bravest and wisest man I have ever come across in the pages of a book. How he has taken the catastrophic event of the plane crash, followed by deaths, freezing weather, broken bodies, hunger, etc. and turn it into the Miracle of the title is just about beyond my comprehension. What a man he is to realize that we cannot let one event define our lives, no matter how painful or horrific that event may be. He also has somehow rallied together, every single year for 30 plus years, his fellow survivors, and they are all smiling in every photo I have ever seen of them. He is my hero. All of these men are heroes. I can't think of enough ways of stating how wonderful this book is, and how fabulous its message is. Please, please read it and recommend it to anyone who wants to be proud to be a human being."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Miracle In The Andes is compactly written and powerfully emotional. It is written in the first person by one of the heros of the story, Nando Parrado and co-written by a professional writer. It tells the saga of an Uruguyan rugby team that crashes in the high Andes on a flight to Chile for a match. Their are 45 persons on board and 16 survive. They are stranded about 12000 feet on a glacier and surrounded by snow capped mountains which are part of the second highest range in the world.This nightmare lasts for 72 days and nights. They are lightly clothed and have only the broken fusulge for shelter. They turn to the meat of their dead friends to survive.Nando Parrado who turned age 23 turning this strggle finds the true meaning of life as he is certain that he will die there. I will not spoil the story for you by telling you what he claims the secret is to the meaning of life.He does believe too that rubgy and the lessons of such a sport had a big influence on their survival. Principles such as selflessness, strategy, persistence and team work helped them survive.This book describes the awesome power of nature, the temporariness of life and highlights the permanent nature of death. As one reads it , he or she will probably reflect on one or more struggles faced in his own life. More importantly, you will want to waste not one more second of your life. This book is one of the best that I have read this year and I read about 200 per year. I meant it to be rated 5 stars, not three as shown."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This book saved my life. My goal in this review isn't to explain the contents or to judge it objectively, but to describe how it impacted MY life.I was struggling with the darkest days of having lost a loved one in a sudden random and senseless tragedy last Fall, which subsequently brought a stark and clear picture of how fragile the world around me was. Though had I bought and read \\"Miracle In the Andes\\" several times in early 2008, I was startled by the dimension and power that was revealed by the words through my unfiltered pain and loss later in the year.Parrado's depth of feeling shines through his writing with Rause. The book gives a human dimension to his experiences, focusing on his psychology alone. The pacing is perfect, making it an easy read yet forcing me to simplify the complexities in my own life. The book made one thing abundantly clear: For love to exist in this harsh, sometimes cruel world, THAT in itself is a miracle. Death is a certainty, so embrace life. Share love. Live fully for yourself and the loved ones who no longer can. Do not allow a tragedy to define you, but do allow it to teach you.I am fortunate Parrado has shared his intimate, unimaginable losses and experience with readers. Perhaps it was his beliefs were already similar to mine, or that his words were so compelling it made me examine my own faith. In the end, it didn't matter- I was engrossed. The more I read it, the more the book dragged me back onto the cliff and allowed me to emerge from the painful fog in which I had been drifting aimlessly and angrily. It reminded me that the world still rotates, that \\"getting on with it\\" to overcome my \\"personal Andes\\" was the best gift I could give myself."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Throw away all your 'self-help' books because this is the real deal. 'Miracle in the Andes' is a must-read, can't put down, classic story of one man's struggle against circumstances almost beyond human comprehension.We all kind of know the story: a plane filled with strong, young rugby players crashes deep in the Andes mountains and the survivors are left for dead by government searchers who believed that no one could survive such conditions. The survivors are faced with below zero temperatures, no food, little shelter, an avalanche and finally, the realization that their only chance at survival is to find their own way out of the mountains.The story was first told in the 1972 best-seller, 'Alive'. My remembrance is that the revealations about cannibalism almost overwhelmed the incredible story of survival. The 35 years between 'Alive' and 'Miracle in the Andes' consigns the new book with a perspective that minimizes the garish details and puts the spotlight on the almost mythic miracle of this group's survival.Nando Parrado is my new hero. This is an ordinary guy who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances. In a flash, his mother is dead and his beloved younger sister is grievously injured. The survivors are tested over and over by events that crush their flickering spirits and will to survive. First, the news that the search has been called off. Then, an avalance in the middle of the night that kills many of the original suvivors. Finally, a first 'expedition' that ends in abject failure. Through all of this, Nando retains the will to live. He desperately wants to retun home. He wants to comfort his grieving father.Nando's will to live is so extraordinary that it made me want to examine my own life, to review personal adversity and hardship. Lots of books are able to stir emotion but Miracle in the Andes is the only one in recent memory to throw everything into perspective, to make the reader feel like they can get up and overcome anything in their own lives. Parrado's story is really the 'Road Less Travelled'."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Readers will wonder what Nando Parrado has to say that wasn't already said in Piers Paul Read's masterpiece, \\"Alive.\\" Even Parrado expresses his doubts that he can add something to Read's tale (he says Read told the story \\"masterfully\\"). But, behold a new masterpiece: Parrado and co-author Vince Rause have created a stirring, compelling piece of work.Whereas Read's work is a facts-based recounting of the events, Parrado and Rause put you inside the head of the pivotal protagonist, the survivor most committed to striking out on an expedition. We see his commitment (\\"I tell myself that each step takes me closer to my father\\"), his fears, his horror at losing two family members at the crash site. Amazing stuff, shaped into powerful, declarative language by Rause. The text is crisp, sharp and fast moving. Rause captures Parrado's voice.It's estimated that Parrado and fellow expeditionary Roberto Canessa traveled some 45 miles before running into a peasant herder tending to his flocks. That's 45 of the hardest miles imaginable. So hard, in fact, that the rescuers ask Parrado - as they ready to scale a 13,000 ft peak via helicopter - \\"Are you sure you understand this map?\\" They're simply incredulous (rightfully so) that these two had crossed the high Andes on foot (\\"Impossible!\\"). But, indeed they had. It's mind-boggling...a trip that has to rank in the annals with Shackleton's journey across the seas in a skiff back to South Georgia."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is a book that ranks alongside Cherry-Goddard's 'Worst Journey in the World'. The outline of the story is well-recounted elsewhere, but I found the spiritual angle of the book fascinating. One remarkable thing is that in spite of the awful outcome for many of the passengers and the unbelievable hardship suffered by the others, for some of the survivors their faith was strengthened, for others it was destroyed. The author states that he considers the arbitrary waste of (a devout) life as evidence for the absence of God, at least a God who \\"sets one religion above another\\".Being so close to death has clearly made Nando much more aware of the importance of life and of the love of friends and family. Nando is obviously extremely close to his father who was obviously an inspiration for him. Reading this book is surely a better way of understanding team work than going on a management jolly whether or not it involves white water rafting."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I read this book in a day as well. Nando Parrado writes so eloquently about this ordeal, no movie or outside reporter could have done better. It is told in first person, and no emotion is left out. The book is about the human spirit and the will to survive. I wish I could meet Mr. Parrado and thank him for writing such a moving piece of literature. Like he says in the last chapter, everyone has their own Andes to overcome."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I cannot add to the other 5 star reviews here, but am simply compelled to add my own 5 stars to this brilliant book.If you are as stirred by this story as I am (I've read other books on the subject several times and find new things that touch me each time), then you MUST read Nando's viewpoint, because it is the very marrow of the story. I'm recommending this book to everyone, it is mesmerizing. With this book, it is as if you are making the agonizing climb at Parrado and Canessa's side. Parrado's story is told in such a way that we can translate it into our own lives, as each of us has his/her own \\"Andes\\" to conquer. Parrado generously opens himself to the reader so unabashedly and honestly that it feels like spending 70 days inside the man's head.And this story is so much more than the gruesome aspects, so very much more. When the experience gets limited to that aspect, then the story is wholly deprived of its lessons, and the dead and the survivors wholly deprived of their humanity. They deserve better. They did not ask for this experience.If you read no other book on this subject, then Nando Parrado's book would be my pick for you. The most uplifting and empowering book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Excellent! Thank you, Mr. Parrado for sharing with us your story. Alive by Piers Paul Read was awesome for it's detailed accuracy and depth, but it was wonderful to hear the story from someone who actually was there and lived it.This book should be required reading for all those people who zip through life \\"sweating the small things\\"."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Miracle in the Andes by Vince Rause is one of the best story's I have ever read! Just the idea of surviving 72 days in the amazingly large and unforgiving Andes Mountains without food, water, warm clothing, and not the most sturdy shelter.Miracle in the Andes is an amazing story about a rugby team that is flying to Chile for a rugby match. They have to cross the Andes Mountains to reach Chile. In the process they crash on the peak of one of the mountains. The plane hits the peak of the mountain in the middle of the plane and splits into two pieces. The front half of the plane falls perfectly and matches the angle of the slope almost exactly and glides down the mountain. The back half of the plane disappears into the deep white death of the mountains. So all-26 people survived the first miracle: the first impact. The fuselage of the airplane was moving down the hill at over 200 miles per our. The fuselage was quickly gaining speed. The plane glided right in-between two large boulders. That was miracle number two. At the bottom of the snowy slope was a ice glacier. The fuselage smashed at full force into the glacier. The force completely smashed the front of the plane. Twenty two people survived the third miracle. Since the survivors of all of the three miracles were all teammates on their rugby team, they got along very well and loved each other and comforted each other. All of the food that they had was a half full bag of peanuts, two bottles of wine, a bottle of tequila, and a couple of chocolate bars. Imagine if you were on a commercial flight with a bunch of people you didn't know and that was all of the food that you had. Would you share it with all of the people on the plane, or would you keep it to yourself and your loved ones? Would you be able to speak to all of the other people who were from different countries?The main character in the story is a man named Nando Parado. Nando's mother and his sister both died in the crash. He was one of the star players on their rugby team. All of the rugby players were really fit and in the best shape of their life.So people think, \\"Wow! They survived 72 days in the Andes Mountains!\\" I think that that is one of the most physically difficult things you can do. But the really amazing thing is that Nando and one of his best friends Roberto climbed out of the mountains with no supplies and almost no food. It took them 11 days. They covered an amazing 72 miles. Nando and Roberto hiked, climbed, and staggered up cliff after cliff just saying to themselves, \\"Well, I'm probably going to die anyway, so I might as well die trying. Let's roll!\\"So the story is great. The real question is will Nando and Roberto be able to hike to shelter and both survive with the little amounts of human flesh they have to eat? Will they be a able to find the fuselage and rescue the rest of their rugby team? This is probably one of the best stories I have ever read, and I would definitely recommend it to you.I really love the way Vince Rause can explain the situation and really gives you a great picture in your mind of what is going on in the story with out boring you with too many details. He really had a way of painting a picture in my mind and making me think; how would I feel if I were in this position? He also has a very large vocabulary and he never seems to use the same words twice. I would most definitely recommend this book. I will guaranty you will like it!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I agree with Mr. Parrado's outlook on life. Every single moment should be cherished with the ones you love. The love he had for his father was what gave him the strength to make the long trek to safety. This story gives so much great detail about the crash and the aftermath. Much better than the movie of course. Plus, it's important to realize that we often have more than we need in life. This book can be a wake-up call to those who feel as if they are having rough times. Are they really? Nando and Roberto felt like they were in a 5-star hotel once they started seeing grass and had water to drink as well on their trek out of the mountains. Everyone goes through pain, it is how you deal with that adversity that matters. This book has a greater reach than just to people interested in their survival story. It effectively reaches those who can go through tough times and move on in the best possible way. It's highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is a book I won't forget for a long, long time.

Yes, I thought Alive was amazing when I read it 38 years ago, and it's perhaps a better-written book, but it's hard to believe that anyone would nitpick with Parrado's storytelling abilities after the extraordinary, firsthand experience he gives us in this book. Maybe it's the fact that it isn't slick, perfect writing that makes the book so compelling. They were just a bunch of kids and what they had to do to survive and maintain their spirits and their sanity(..and not just what they ate)was astounding."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Great story, pretty cool writing but I felt the author bemoaned certain areas.

I was going to say that reading this book transformed me - but that's not quite right. Reading about other peoples' transforming experiences doesn't really transform us - but it serves to connect us to them.

It was simply a silence, a wholeness, an awe-inspiring simplicity. It seemed to reach me through my own feelings of love, and I have often thought that when we feel what we call love, we are really feeling our connection to this awesome presence.\\" A little later, he writes: \\"It wasn't cleverness or courage or any kind of competence or savvy that saved us, it was nothing more than love, our love for each other, for our families, for the lives we wanted so desperately to live.\\"I guess that's what stands out for me in this book - this acknowledgement of the power and presence of love, and our connection to our fellow beings.

The conclusions the author comes to, after 30 years of soul-searching, are courageous and down-to-earth.The author's loyalty to his friends and fellow survivors is also admirable, as well as his loyalty to the memory of the ones who didn't survive.

Many of us have read the book \\"Alive\\" which was published shortly after the incident, so we know the story. But this telling is so much more, because it shows the evolution of the author's point of view during his ordeal.The most chilling part of the story was not the consumption of the dead, but rather the hike out of the Andes. Those mountains become a living character as well.Shortly after reading this book my husband and I had dinner at a local Massachusetts restaurant where our two waiters were from Uraguay.

(never read it)."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Nando Parrado recounts his ordeal in the aftermath of the crash in the high Andes of the Uruguayan plane he was taking along with other members of his rugby team, some family members and friends bound for Chile in the winter of 1972. Just in case you don't remember, this was the Peron era in Chile. The team was on its way to a rugby match and brought along some close friends and relatives to spread the cost and make hiring a private plane more affordable. They were all anticipating fun and relaxation in Chile, and brought along lots of cigarettes because Chile was experiencing shortages of luxury items due to the political situation at the time. They crashed due to rough weather and pilot error. Some passengers and all the crew died from the crash. Others died from their injuries in the days following. Still others died when an avalanche buried them inside the fuselage where survivors were awaiting rescue for days, then weeks, and finally months to no avail. Nando and two others, after waiting in vain for rescue, undertook to climb their way up and out of their crash site to civilization. Though never a leader on the rugby team, and not particularly inclined to leadership before in his life, Nando became the driving force behind the long walk to survival.Piers Paul Read [ALIVE!] told the story of the group's experiences competently and thoroughly shortly after their rescue, and his book was popular in the 70s for the drama of this tale, especially his description of how survivors were driven to eat the flesh of their dead friends and loved ones, as it was the only source of food in the frozen landscape. [They never ran out of cigarettes, however!]But Nando tells his own story, including his spiritual journey, his humility, his love of his family, and his determination to live. One fascinating aspect of his story is the culture and philosophy of rugby that these young men took with them and that influenced how they approached the challenges of survival. The book also tells how he stumbled, many years later, onto writing this book when he was coerced into giving an inspirational keynote speech, and found the details of his long ago ordeal pouring out to the crowd who sat in rapt attention for several hours. When the young Nando had returned to Uruguay, he found himself transformed in the eyes of others into a hero, as were all the survivors. What's ironic about his account, however, is that, while he calls it 'Miracle in the Andes', it is clear that sheer human will and determination is what made survival possible, and that THAT is what constitutes the miracle, not anything supernatural.I found it useful to reread Read's book after Parrado's account, just to remind myself of some of the aspects not included in this version. A nice addition to Parrado's version is the update he provides on the survivors' lives 30+ years later. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Piers Paul Read wrote the great book Alive and after an excellent movie it could be thought there was little more left to the actual story. Wrong. Nando Parrado adds much much more to this survival story and doesn't re-tell like Read but lets you know what happened to him and his emotions on the mountain. This is a great companion to the classic book. Most (myself included) wanted to be Nando - he was strong, and saved his friends through unreal internal fortitude - he's a genuine hero. His is one of the most compelling survival stories in recorded history and this is a worthy memoir.Where Read lets you know what happened Parrado lets you know the why's and how's they survived - the real heart of this story. He let's the reader know in more detail the miserable existence on the mountain. When you read his thought \\"tears waste salt\\" it might sound cold hearted but it was the RIGHT thought and you begin to understand his inner strength. His thoughts about his family are touching, his feelings about his great father are insightful - what a fortunate son, what a fortunate father. Without his father the disappearance of the plane would remain a mystery.In an interview Roberto Canessa once said the survivors know each other better than anyone. I really didn't understand that until reading this book. Parrado also sheds light on some negative depictions of survivors in Read's book and it helps the reader understand their actions. I also enjoyed reading what happened to Parrado after the incident and how the words and behavior of his friends who died on the mountain has influenced him. It took Parrado a long time to realize how inspirational his story is and it's great he's written his story. Make no mistake; this story is not about cannibalism, it is about love, survival and determination. I'm a better person for having read this book."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is one of the most remarkable books I've ever read - just an incredible story and told with perfect pacing. I started reading the book on a plane of all places and then finished it the first night at 4:00 in the morning. You won't be able to put it down - even though you'll know the ending.The story truly puts our small problems in perspective and gives the reader an apprecition for the human spirit at it's most tested.Now I just want to find someway to hear Nando Parrado speak in person."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"As a youngster, I heard bits and pieces of this story--an Andes plane crash; a rugby team; cannibalism; heroism and terror. When I saw that a new, more personal account was being released, I knew I would have to read it, to experience the horror and amazement that my own father felt in the generation before me.\\"Miracle in the Andes\\" is a superbly written book. A prologue hints at much greater trouble to come with a brief description of the plane crash's aftermath. Then, with building, unrelenting drama, the story follows the chronological path of the ordeal. As a reader, I was awed by the grandeur and beauty of the Andes, then frightened by their rapid weather changes and malevolent moods. I related to different individuals' reactions--and lack thereof--to the trials they endured. At certain points, I laughed. Or shook my head. Or took a deep breath and moved on. By the end, I was moved to tears by Nando's final poignancies and his reunion with his father.Like \\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"Endurance,\\" this book has all the qualities of fantastic non-fiction, mixing detail and human drama without melodrama. It provides tasteful photos and clear maps for clarity. Going beyond even the soul-searching of \\"Touching the Void,\\" \\"Miracle in the Andes\\" moves forward with unflinching honesty and believable introspection. It's an account of challenge and encouragement to each of us as we go through trials that life throws our way. With his talented co-writer, Nando peels back the layers of his memory and emotion to glean from his experience and then to pass on that learning to others. The passage of time not only lends weight to his words, it lends a humility and grace."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Although the stories of the rugby players who crash landed in the Andes and survived there for months is well known, especially as told by Alive. In this book, a survivor tells the story from his perspective. This book makes you really believe the saying that truth is stranger than fiction. I would find it hard to believe that a charter plain could crash land in the Andes (after coming apart in mid-air), have over half those on board survive (but not the plane's crew), that these remaining mostly young men could survive for 72 days in the freezing temperatures with just snow to drink and flesh to eat, and that two men could attempt a ten-day journey through the Andes. But it happened, and this is the story as told by one of the two men who went in search of rescue.Quote: \\"Nando, I want you to remember, even in this place, our lives have meaning. Our suffering is not for nothing. Even if we are trapped here forever, we can love our families, and God, and each other as long as we live. Even in this place, our lives are worth living.\\"I thought this book was amazing- sad, though-provoking, suspenseful, I couldn't put it down. The author makes it clear that he is telling his own story, not just the facts of what happened, but also his feelings and internal conflict during that time. He does not sensationalize the story (which he felt the media did)- instead of dwelling on grisly facts for shock value, he mentions them, that the survivors did what they had to do, and moves on. what the media considers most important in the story and what he believes people should take from it are very different things."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I read the book \\"Alive\\" years ago and also saw the movie. In all the years hence, though I have read many books on survival and inspiration, nothing resonates like this story. For me, it is the most incredible tale of a terrifying journey through the worst human misery, death and despair to the ultimate in courage, friendship and sheer determination to reclaim life. And Mr. Parrado has to me always been at the center of the story; to my family he is so inspiring that \\"NANDO\\" is our code word for never giving up and having courage when faced with the worst you can imagine.I was delighted to see that Nando Parrado wrote this book and reading it only confirmed to me how extraordinary a spirit he is - and how heartrending the ordeal all the souls on that plane endured. This book offers a deeper picture of the tragedy, giving an unvarnished look at the suffering and emotions of the people involved in the crash, as well as a firsthand account of the \\"miracle\\" of how they rescued themselves.You can view this book as an incredible story of survival, a true guide for facing adversity with bravery and will, or an inspiring revelation on living life to the fullest - it is all of these. Nando Parrado says he is not a hero, but his spirit and story are transcendant, compelling, wonderful. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Piers Paul Read's classic, Alive, introduced the world to the tragedy that befell the Old Christians rugby team when their chartered plane crashed in the Andes Mountains. Nando Parrado follows up, over 20 years later, with what should be another classic. Miracle in the Andes is Parrado's first-hand account of what happened, how he and his teammates survived while waiting for help that would never come, how he and Roberto Canessa struggled mightily over mountain passes in subzero weather to find help, and how the experience has affected every moment of his life for the better.While Read's account is in no way diminished and remains a classic, Parrado adds a depth to the story that only an actual survivor can provide. Only he can fully convey the emotions of knowing his mother and sister were killed in the crash, and that his father back home didn't know that he was struggling to survive. Only he can convey the emotions and the difficult choices the survivors faced. Only he can convey how his life was changed. Parrado succeeds on all levels.This is not simply a rehash of Read's book. It comes from a unique point of view that is compelling and inspirational. It adds a new dimension to the story and addresses many issues that Read did not and could not. This is a story written by a true hero. It is timeless, and that is why, almost 25 years after the tragedy, it still resonates with so many people."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This is without a doubt one of the greatest survival stories ever told. If you have an interest in truly inspirational stories of survival, such as Joe Simpson (Touching the Void), Aaron Ralston (Rock and a Hard Place), then this is a story that you MUST read. This is a first hand account of the survival of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the middle of the Andes mountains in South America in 1972. Though the book 'Alive! was written in 1974 by Piers Paul Read and documented the story from extensive interviews, this book is an autobiographical account written by Nando Parrado (one of the men who managed to climb out to get help), and not only describes the unbelievable hardship the survivors of the plane crash had to endure for 72 days, but also gives an amazing insight into the faith and courage that human beings can find in adversity. Most people are familiar with the story, which is notorious for the consumption of their dead counterparts bodies, however Parrado's account is so much more than just this aspect of the survival. He takes the reader inside a situation that is so disastrous it defies belief, but by a combination of incredible camaraderie and faith in each other, and the way they adapt to their desolate surroundings, a small number hang on despite the horrendous adversity. Parrado also describes in detail the aftermath of the survival and how he coped with getting back to reality and getting on with his life - which is a story in itself - as well as describing the unshakeable bond between the survivors and how they meet up each year on the the rescue anniversary.There are too many awe inspiring moments to champion this novel, the survivors cheated death every day for 72 days, but Nando's descriptions of how he maintained the will to live are the recurring theme. I read this book in one sitting as have waited a long time to get a first hand account of the saga and was not disappointed. You cannot help but want to tell everyone you know about the story like me. This book can change your life as you realise how fragile human existence is and what the human spirit is capable of. Live every moment, don't waste a breath."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This story, already known by many readers, will never get old because the type of heroism depicted here by Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa is so unusual that it was truly astounding that ANY human being was capable of successfully doing it. You will cry when families are reunited. You will shiver in the cold of the Andes. You will breathe more shallowly as the avalanche hardens over your body. You will suffer when survivors of the crash die on the mountain of other causes. You will understand when the victims discuss whether to die by starvation or by the pervasive cold. But, it is such an uplifting story that everyone should read it. The author, Vince Rouse, was supremely successful in not being a part of the story. He simply disappears from view as the ghost writer, but his words are powerful, accurate, and hard to improve on. It is a shame that five stars is the maximum rating. This book deserves eight of them, and I am not prone to using hyperbole."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"And this is his story.Those who couldn't stomach the graphic descriptions of cannibalism in \\"Alive\\" could handle this; Parrado doesn't go into much detail but simply describes what they all had to do. That ANYONE survived that long under such adverse conditions was amazing in itself, and his description of how he and Roberto Canessa walked out of the mountains almost sounds like an Everest expedition....without the most basic supplies.One might have expected the survivors to succumb to suicide, multiple divorces, drug and alcohol abuse, etc. but that doesn't seem to have been the case. Parrado and another survivor had to do an \\"intervention\\" on a third survivor, but who knows? He might have been prone to addiction anyway. All 16 men still live in Uruguay or the region, and get together at least once a year. They have been through something together that only they understand.It's a love story - a story of love for family and friends, and his understanding of God.Read this book!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Although the stories of the rugby players who crash landed in the Andes and survived there for months is well known, especially as told by Alive. In this book, a survivor tells the story from his perspective. This book makes you really believe the saying that truth is stranger than fiction. I would find it hard to believe that a charter plain could crash land in the Andes (after coming apart in mid-air), have over half those on board survive (but not the plane's crew), that these remaining mostly young men could survive for 72 days in the freezing temperatures with just snow to drink and flesh to eat, and that two men could attempt a ten-day journey through the Andes. But it happened, and this is the story as told by one of the two men who went in search of rescue.Quote: \\"Nando, I want you to remember, even in this place, our lives have meaning. Our suffering is not for nothing. Even if we are trapped here forever, we can love our families, and God, and each other as long as we live. Even in this place, our lives are worth living.\\"I thought this book was amazing- sad, though-provoking, suspenseful, I couldn't put it down. The author makes it clear that he is telling his own story, not just the facts of what happened, but also his feelings and internal conflict during that time. He does not sensationalize the story (which he felt the media did)- instead of dwelling on grisly facts for shock value, he mentions them, that the survivors did what they had to do, and moves on. what the media considers most important in the story and what he believes people should take from it are very different things."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"When I watched the movie 'Alive' many years ago it shook me to the core. I never forgot it and was always greatly inspired by Nando Parrado's determination to walk out of the Andes after surviving the plane crash.To me the one phrase that summarises him is when he turns to his companion Roberto on their death defying walk out of the crash site and says 'We may be walking to our deaths..but I would rather walk to my death then wait for it to come to me.'..I always wondered what it was like for him when he first saw something other than snow and rock and what were his emotions when he first saw a human after 72 days that would mean he was saved. This book is worth the price just for the chapter '..I see a man'.I have read this book,re read it and can't stop thinking about it. It is a warmly written book about a stark event of human survival, but it's written as if Nandos is just talking to you after you've asked the question ..what really happened up there?"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"First let me say I read about a book a week and this is the best book I have ever read. If your not hooked by page 42 or so I dont know what book could hold your attention. This story, this incredible story of the will to survive and the process the human mind goes through in the face of unimaginable pain, suffering and starvation should be manditory reading for everyone."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I finished reading MIRACLE IN THE ANDES a few moments ago and felt motivated to write a review. MIRACLE is a true story of survival under the most extreme circumstances. Nando Parrado was one of the suvivors of the tragic plane crash high in the Andes in 1972. With no food and no chance of rescue, the survivors were forced to make a horrifying decision to use the bodies of their lost friends as food. Parrado tells the horror and also the logic in this decision. The human spirit had to survive. Parrado is just an average guy in a situation that tests all the strength in his body. He tells his story with honesty from the tragic loss of his mother, sister and friends on the mountain to the joy of an unbelievable survival. MIRACLE takes Pier Paul Read's best-seller ALIVE to a different level. ALIVE relays the facts of the story. MIRACLE IN THE ANDES explores the deep workings of the mind of a person faced with unbearable choices - his thought processes, his fears and his dreams. Knowing time was running out, Parrado was one of the two men who climbed the mountain to find help. Anyone who doubts that miracles can happen will find inspiration in this book."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I saw the movie ALIVE as well as read the book and was always moved by the story of these individuals. When I found out that Nando Parrado was writing a book about his experience I knew I had to get it right away. The book is so moving and gives such heartfelt honesty. It was great to hear about the survivors today because I always wondered about their lives. This book is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I actually bought this book because \\"Alive\\" was not available on Kindle and I had listened to a radio interview with the author, Nando Parrado. I was expecting more of an adventure story detailing the facts of the accident and rescue. But this book, while containing some of those elements, was much more a story of the inner conflicts and determination of one man to survive.It is an incredible story to be sure and I would happily pay to go hear the author speak. The book however, feels repetitive and a bit forced. As if there had been a target length.....I found myself skimming through large sections. I would still recommend the book!"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Miracle in the Andes by Nando Parrado is a survival story about determination, perseverance and courage. Parrado tells the story, through his eyes, about the 72 days he and the rugby team endured after their plane, which was flying to Chile, crashed in a remote part of the Andes during winter. Many of his teammates were killed in the crash which also claimed the life of his mother and sister.Parrado tells his story with detail and eloquence that makes Miracle in the Andes a well written, enjoyable and touching story. Although the book is written with detail and clarity it is still difficult for the reader to really comprehend the level of discomfort from the bitter cold, the injuries, the uncertainty, the loss, the grief, and the realization that rescue efforts have been terminated. Still, you will walk away with an appreciation for his persistence and perseverance. The survivors were left with little survival gear yet they denied death by not giving up or giving in. Yes, there were set backs such as an avalanche that took an additional eight lives. They had to resort to eating the dead in order to survive. While cannibalism headlines grabbed the news when the story initially broke you realize that this was just a method of survival and nothing more. They simply did what needed to be done in order to survive.The epilogue provides an update to the story along with insight that is only gained through surviving such a difficult and challenging ordeal. According to Parrado:\\"The ability to be truly alive and aware, to savor each moment of life with presence and gratitude, this is the gift the Andes gave us.\\"He then goes on to state:\\"It wasn't cleverness or courage or any kind of competence or savvy that saved us, it was nothing more than love, our love for each other, for our families, for the lives we wanted so desperately to live. Our suffering in the Andes had swept away everything trivial and unimportant. Each of us realized, with a clarity that is hard to describe, that the only crucial thing in life is the chance to love and be loved.\\"Finding purpose in life and trying to give meaning to such a tragedy is important. I believe that Nando provides great insight with his story.Miracle in the Andes is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I have always been haunted by this story, mainly because my father, a longtime aviator, told me what happened right at the time the world was shocked by the news they were alive.And now, more than 35 years after, Nando Parrado has the fantastic idea of writing his own book, whose biggest merit is exactly the naturally acquired maturity of the author. He escapes from the easy calling of self-pity and, most of all, self-eulogy. He refuses, till this day, being called a hero. This is understandable, because he would be receiving the laurels over his beloved mother and sister dead bodies.But even the most superficial look through the story shows that Nando Parrado is a REAL HERO. Largely above the narration of cannibalism (which is simply a \\"side story\\", and so gets serene and brief reports), there are moments that turn reading this masterpiece a real worthwhile experience: first, the detailed account of the 12-day journey Nando and Roberto Caneza took down the mountains and glaciers, with no equipment, hardly a pair of shoes, no tent to bear the horrid nights and no water. Also, the section where Nando, exhausted and blinded by the blizzard carries Roy Harlin upon his shoulders from sure death in the snow to relief among the others. And above all, the reader is taken to the exact moment when Nando Parrado stumbles on the revelation that would eventually define this story, his own life and maybe the lives of everyone in this world: that the opposite of death is... well, I'm not going to spoil your pleasure of reading it yourself, am I ?"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Fabulous insight firsthand. Nobody can imagine what it was like, unless they'd actually been there. Nando takes us back to the Andes and his personal touch, thoughts, feelings, make the real story have a wonderful, deep meaning beyond the story itself. I loved it. It made me re-think a lot of my own priorities and blessings taken for granted. Wonderful, wonderful book. Thanks Nando for sharing your experience! I'm from Argentina and my brother used to play rugby in the 70's, so this story means something very special for me in particular. I can't say enough about how much I liked this book."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Nando Parrado has wriiten a great book, not only on survival skills, but on the Leadership it took to pull the survivors together to work as a team."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This book takes you on a journey that inspires you to live everyday to the fullest and appreciate what you have.It's a incredible book and hard to put down once you start reading.

You get to read about the emotions and feelings. It's very compelling and touching. Also, I emailed Nando after I had read it a few times and he emailed me back! What a genuine person! Try that with your fave author!I was very impressed with how well-written this was. The pictures in the middle were an education in and of themselves also.

I bought this book because I love the movie \\"Alive\\" and this book just adds more detail to this story that is not shown in the movie. These men were faced with impossible circumstances, but they never lost hope that they would make it out of there alive. Nando Parrado is a true hero. It was because of his hope that he never let go and he always believed he would return home. He knew he had to make it happen, so he did."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Absolutely fantastic book. I am not a great reader and I start a lot of books but dont finish them. However, this one was riveting! Awesome read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Nando's story has been heard before, but never in this detail. In the previous telling of their tale, one had to use a little imagination to put themselves into the minds of the 16 men stranded in the Andes. In this novel, there is no imagination needed, you simply are there. You are Nando, holding your beloved sister as she slowly slips away before you. You are the man that almost dies in an avalanche. You are the man that conquered a mountain, to despair at the sight at the summit and you are the man that finally found salvation by way of a farmer in the middle of nowhere. The story itself is gripping and intense, even with the most rudimentary writing, the story would have power. However, the writing in this novel is far beyond rudimentary and the story literally explodes off the pages.In the end, this story is about how an ordinary man was able to go to extraordinary lengths with the simple power of love."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"I just wanted to comment for those who were interested in the audiobook version.Firstly, the book is fantastic! I loved reading/hearing about it. I had read Alive and it was great to get another perspective, a truer perspective, that from one of the survivors.This audiobook is well narrated, but what I really enjoyed were the times that Nando narrates himself. He narrates the introduction and epilogue portions of the book. An added BONUS is the interview between Nando and the publishers (I believe) on Disc 5. That part of the audiobook is worth a listen. He's a great inspiration."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Many people believe that the greatest story ever told is an ancient myth that has survived the ages. My vote for this distinction is Miracle In The Andes--a true story about 16 beautiful young men who survived a plane crash in the early 1970s. The theme is transcendence--of nature, of the human condition, of personal limitations and of cosmic bad luck. It makes you nearly as breathless as those who were stranded for 72 days at 12,000 feet with their injuries, the corpses of family members and friends, no food, no warm clothing or enclosed shelter. But the book doesn't leave you breathless. At the end, the mature memoirist reflects on the meaning of the ordeal and teaches a lesson about love that may surpass anything you ever learned in sunday school! The writing is flawless, as brilliant as the Hope diamond. Imagine the literary qualities of Primo Levi's If This Were A Man combined with Maurice Herzog's Annapurna, and you begin to get an idea of this book's majesty."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"Loved this book...it broke my heart and made me swell with pride...broke my heart again...and made me jump up and down with gratitude that this group was so strong and unwilling to give up.Don't miss this book."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged]","review":"This book is among the top non-fiction books I have ever read.

How many - single women in their 20's who live on their own in a big city with powerful careers and no life outside of it, who are independent enough to have sex and not care, yet can't focus on anything else except sex and love - do I have to read about? I was this woman for a good number of years, but I had a lot more going on in my life. Please - SOMEBODY give these characters some dimension."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"This book had such potential, but the characters were so static and did not develop or mature in any way throughout the novel. I was very disappointed in the protagonist's unemotional responses to emotional situations and subjects. McDermott does have a beautiful style of writing, but she did not take these characters to the level that she could have. The ending was anti-climatic and frustrating."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"Elizabeth Connelly works for a Manhattan vanity press. When Tupper Daniels, a sure-to-be-published author presents her with the story of a bigamist in his southern hometown, she jokingly kids that her own father had more than one wife.Tupper's book lacks an ending, and Elizabeth seriously considers whether her father was indeed a bigamist. Together author and editor forge a relationship to search for the end of one story and the truth of another. I reached the end of A BIGAMIST'S DAUGHTER without resolution to either quest. I'm not even sure what becomes of Tupper and Elizabeth, the couple.As a story that describes itself as &quot;an absolutely contemporary portrait of a new generation's search for--and avoidance of--committment in life and love,&quot; it's not a picture I would hang on a wall."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"I received The Bigamist's Daughter as a gift as &quot;anything written by Alice McDermott&quot; was highly recommended by Anna Quindlen in a USA Today story. Although the writing is precise and flows, the story and the characters are not engaging. Elizabeth the main character seems to be sleep walking through her life, her affair and her job. I kept waiting for the story to click and I had to reread the final chapters to see what I was missing. It just wasn't there. No stars is a more accurate assessment of my review. Skip this book. I am going to try another of her titles since I got two as gifts. I will read another Isabel Alende and an Amy Tan and a Jane Austen in between."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"In a novel that dissects, deconstructs and recreates the fabric of life, love and literature, the author spotlights the world of publishing; the mythology of love, the elusiveness of the love object - all as the centerpiece of this work - formulate the basis for this story.We begin with Elizabeth Connelly, a single woman living in New York - some time in the twentieth century, before computers or the current Internet generation - and discover her real life as an \\"editor-in-chief\\" at what is known in that day as a \\"vanity press.\\" She meets her potential authors, praises their work - even when it is less than stellar - and signs them to contracts. They pay their fee and dream their dreams.But one day she meets an author - Tupper Daniels, a southern gentleman - and in helping him \\"create an ending\\" for his unfinished manuscript, she stumbles down a path of exploration that leads her into the surreal world of elusive fathers - traveling fathers like her own - who are leading secret lives. Questioning all the stories told her by her mother, and examining her own tendency to tell tales - even create myths - about her own past loves, she begins to understand that fantasies, illusions and love myths have a life of their own, flourishing because of the necessity to preserve those very myths.Fascinating portrayal of love, literature, and the elusive nature of dreams,A Bigamist's Daughteris a memorable novel that earns five stars.Laurel-Rain Snow"},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"Generally Alice's writing makes me think and follow closely so as not to miss her little back-and-forths with her characters. I enjoy her writing style and story lines very much.However, and a big however it is, this book had such a disappointing ending that I can't even recommend it in good conscience. More precisely, it had NOOO ending at all. The story started out with some direction but quickly lost it. The farther I read the more I wondered whose secrets we were going to uncover. In the end we uncovered nothing. She left us hanging here folks.Tupper was horrible. His personality was as bland as his complexion. And arrogant??? What's the guy so proud of? Elizabeth could've been okay if she'd snapped out of her coma and decided to have any kind of life. Some points made in the book were interesting although incredibly glorifying to a batch of people who selfishly \\"commit\\" themselves to more than one partner. If you want more than one \\"wife\\" don't get married!! No offense intended but how can anyone ever call bigamy a moral alternative to cheating? Or at the least when all parties involved aren't privy to the set up? Doesn't that make it the same thing??But hence I divert. The short version...good author, bad book.

I absolutely despise the narrator, a shallow, vacuous twit who does not resemble me nor most women I know. (Horrid to think any man would take her for a representative of the female sex.)The plot is interesting, if not engaging, but the ending rings false and is terribly disappointing. Also, I found McDermott's description to be cruel in several places.Readers looking for good contemporary female writers should skip McDermott and instead try Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, Barbara Kingsolver or Katherine Weber."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"I liked this so well, I've bought 5 copies as gifts.

Despite her good writing style, McDermott's novels leave me with an unpleasant taste for her characters.."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"A wonderful examination of male-female relationships. The book is funny, it is insightful, it is a revelation to me, a a man. I suspected, but was not clued in to the workings of the female mind. The author ( as in Charming Billy ) is fascinated with the concept of obsessive love. And posits that we have the capacity to love many in a lifetime; star crossed lovers are fine for Romeo and Juliette, but not in the real world. She sees the choices and tradeoffs which we face,and presents them in a most thoughtful and engaging way.I really liked this book. More than her later, &quot;Charming Billy&quot;.She is a talented writer."},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","review":"I had fairly high hopes for this book, although I suppose if I had looked at the reviews I would have known better. The writing in the book was very readable, that being said nothing else about this book fit.The main character was mostly fine, but the relationships between all of the characters was unbelievable. New people appeared and disappeared quickly with little definition. Romantic relationships were highly unbelievable, and the reason for the initial attraction left a great deal to be desired. Everything seemed too easy and superficial, including the supposedly deep-seated feelings of the protagonist.Possibly most upsetting was the plot. It really felt as though McDermott had an idea for a book and was so happy with it that she did not bother to developed it any further. It was like a rough outline with no real climax. All of the plot twists were absent from the book. I kept thinking I knew what the twists were going to be, but they never happened. I suppose you could say that at least it wasn't predictable. I literally read to the last page waiting for the revelation, it never arrived. Unless the shallow emotional clarity that the protagonist was supposed to have experienced was intended to be satisfying. If so it fell far from its mark.

The sheer size of this tome and the expense have probably put off some art lovers, but this is not a book to let slip into obscurity. The organiztion of the book matches the layout of the museum: artists are treated to individual sections where there works can be most appreciated like the condensed spaces of adjoining rooms in the museum itself and each is treated by essayists who know the works and thankfully know how to write!The reproductions are first class, the number of color plates is astonishing. For those who have not had the privilege of visiting the Prado Musuem there will be many surprises. For those who know the art of Spain already, there will be embellishments that are enriching to the eye and the mind. And for those who know the Museum, this book is a must for memory reference.

In fact, if you only have the money for one \\"recovery from abuse\\" book, this one is the one to get. It covers every type of abuse, even spiritual abuse, which was very relevant to my experiences in a bizarre cultic marriage in which I was beaten over the head with the Bible and told to \\"submit\\" all the time. The tone that the book is written in is wonderful. It is neither \\"oh, you poor pathetic baby\\" or \\"get over it, toots\\" but strikes exactly the right tone--empowering and empathetic but not patronizing or overbearing.The book helps you not only analyze what happened to you and why, but gets you into the healing process. This book helped me quit beating myself up for ending up with and staying with an abuser (and having SIX children with him into the bargain), for still having feelings for my abusive husband, and for being tempted to go back. Some of the exercises at the end of the chapters were kind of silly, and I skipped them, but some were excellent. The exercise that helped me the most was the one that helped me to look back and remember why I fell in love with that chump to begin with. It WASN'T because I am brainless.The absolute best thing about this book, in my opinion, is the final chapter. Prior to reading it, I had no idea how in the world I managed to marry an abusive control freak and was scared to death of getting hooked by another one. This chapter really helped me feel capable of choosing another partner who is not abusive. The author tells you exactly what danger signs to look for.

I broke up with whom I thought was the love of my life 2 months ago. Been through hell. I too thought it was insane to love and miss so much a person who was constantly putting me down and hurting me in many ways. It had to stop. But once you're out, STAYING out could be pretty tough.

I applaud the two authors, Meg Kennedy Dugan and Roger R. Hock. Because of this book I have HOPE in my life again!"},{"Title":"It's My Life Now: Starting Over After an Abusive Relationship or Domestic Violence","review":"This book was a life-line for me right after I left my husband.

You are not alone. An important book for recovery."},{"Title":"It's My Life Now: Starting Over After an Abusive Relationship or Domestic Violence","review":"It's My Life Now fills an important gap in the literature on domestic violence. There are several great books out there that help bring the abused to the point of recognizing that they are in an abusive relationship that they must escape. These books help clarify the patterns and cycles that are common to so many abusive relationships. When searching for help and healing myself, I largely encountered books that told me how to get out, get safe, and (had I any children) get custody. But at that point, I had already fought my way out of my abuser's grasp and was searching for something to help me untangle the webs of control, humiliation, and verbal abuse I had endured. I was also struggling with difficult feelings of guilt, loss, and anger that I needed some guidance to process. That is where this book came in: the practical guide to regaining yourself after enduring abuse and/or violence.What is so valuable and remarkable about this book, compared to many others, is that it walks the abused through the complicated (and admittedly frightening) time AFTER she gets out of the relationship.It begins with the typical identification of abuse and abusive behaviors, but as this book is written for those who have already left their abuser, this list serves a different purpose. In an incredibly reassuring and helpful chapter that addresses the feelings of love for the abuser that may still remain, we are asked to make a list of the qualities that were attractive in him in the first place. Then, we return to the initial chapter's list of abusive behaviors and make a list of what type of abuses were committed and with what frequency. The positive list serves to reassure the abused that she had compelling reasons for being attracted to the abuser, while the abuses list reminds her that the abuser (however charming) is not who he seemed. There are many more simple, journal-style exercises that I found important for gaining insight and perspective.The book addresses key issues I encountered in the uncomfortable period that ensued within one week or two of leaving my abuser. The author also recommends that readers return to these topics and exercises one month later, for comparison. (Perspective is everything.) I have emphatically recommended this book to the women I have met in domestic violence support groups, who have returned nothing but praise for the usefulness, pertinence and clarity of It's My Life Now. I have found it invaluable in my own process and will continue to refer to it when I require strength or guidance."},{"Title":"It's My Life Now: Starting Over After an Abusive Relationship or Domestic Violence","review":"I would recommend this book for anyone who has been in a relationship with a controlling person.

When I first heard about this Encyclopedia 8 years ago, I was concerned that it would be another effete European effort to convince Americans that they have no taste.Au contraire! This is the first survey-type of blues review which does justice to disparate blues streams such as blues shouters (barely touched on in Cohn's book) and boogie woogie, as well as Delta blues and obscure East Texas singers of the Twenties.The Encyclopedia is well-organized, with fine summary essays on various blues streams so that the reader can follow developments on different fronts without having to turn back and forth between essays on individuals. There is a generous serving of individual biographical sketches as well, and Gerard does us the favor of pointing out when certain blues artists are following in the footsteps of others.He also does a good job of including glancing references to less well-known blues artists who are worth investigating later in yours blues journey.All in all an excellent reference work with plenty to interest the casual blues fan."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Blues","review":"I have the hard-to-find first edition of G&eacute;rard Herzhaft's Encyclopedia Of The Blues, the one printed in 1996. It is worth finding if you can. If not, this edition (which I am trying to decide whether to buy or not) may well be as good or better than the first. The first edition has over 500 pages, but fewer photos I think. G&eacute;rard Herzhaft's Encyclopedia Of The Blues is the most accurate, in-depth, and comprehensive collection of Blues musician information I have been able to find anywhere in the past 6 years of being an active Blues fan. I wish G&eacute;rard would know how much his great work is appreciated by all of us Blues music fans in the USA and the world. Thank you G&eacute;rard."},{"Title":"The Chemistry of Fullerenes (Advanced Series in Fullerenes)","review":"This is a nice book, indeed - valuable contents, a pleasant form. The book is a contributed volume of fifteen carefully selected chapters. The first contribution (although the author is not specified) suggests a systematic nomenclature for fullerenes, e.g. C60 - [60]fullerene, and numbering schemes. It also contains a statement which still needs to be recognized by the fullerene community: 'C60, the most accessible (but not necessarily the most stable fullerene).Of the fourteen remaining chapters, seven come from R. Taylor (properties of fullerenes, halogenation, aryl derivatives, electrophilic addition, nucleophilic addition, radical addition, fullerene-containing polymers). The other half originated in various world centres of the fullerene research and concentrates on local specialities. L.D. Lamb writes on what made Tucson world famous - the fullerene production. P.A. Cahill reports on computations of hydrogenated fullerenes and compares them with available observations. L.Y. Chiang treats water-soluble polyhydroxylated fullerene derivatives and various ways of their characterization. Another system with an application potential, fluorinated fullerenes, is surveyed by J.H. Holloway and E.G. Hope. M. Prato and F. Wudl deal with various bridged fullerenes: methano, oxa, aza, sila. Cyclo-additon chemistry is described in a chapter by M.S. Meier. And finally, A.L. Balch reviews inorganic and organometallic derivatives of fullerenes.All this is presented on 274 pages of an exciting book, which is also Volume 4 of the Advanced Series in Fullerenes.ISBN 981-02-2304-8"},{"Title":"The Diaper Bag Book for Babies (0-18 months)","review":"This Book is very easy to work with and at the same time so helpful when I have to do my lesson planning, now that I'm moving to the upper level as a teacher of a Pre-Toddlers class,I bought to my self the Toddlers Book of course.

Read The Sacrifice of Tamar....."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I absolutely would NOT recommend this story, listed as a novel but actually an abominably written memoir. Talk about heavy-handed. Naomi Ragen has written with this with a SLEDGE-HAMMER! Nothing is remotely subtle or nuanced, as it should be in any reflection on one's past. She also drives home too many points to begin with, does so with maddening repetition, and employs excruciating melodrama. The story also lacks a consistent voice, weakening it even more. Ragen jumps blindingly from herself as a frightened little girl, to her mother as a completely overwhelmed homemaker, to her father as either a risk-taking marvel or a pitiful, fool-hardy madman, to her own (badly drawn, totally cliche-ridden) spiritual awakening, and finally, to the painfully forced-sounding \\"wisdom\\" she's supposedly gained when she's around 50 and writes the book. And that's just a sampling of the cacophony of voices that hurt the book to no end.As a fellow Jew, I was also truly offended by her blithe, flippant, unflattering descriptions of both profoundly religious Jews and/or recent immigrants on one hand, and secular Jews (painted as oner-dimensional monsters) on the other. I recognize that part of Ragen's own decision to move to Israel stemmed from the love and peace she eventually found in a synagogue, but that fact, ironically, is lost in all the offensive, over-the-top descriptions. I shiver to think what a non-Jewish person who was reading such a book for the first time would come away thinking!I was drawn to her precious cover photo and decided to stick with this book, however more dreadful the writing became, because at the root did lie a compelling tale. But my perseverance did not pay off. Perhaps my disappointment was heightened by having just finished Jhumpa Lahiri's BRILLIANT collection of short stories, \\"Unaccustomed Earth,\\" whose characters experience similar pathos, disconnect, fears and longing as those in \\"Chains Around the Grass.\\" However, the difference in quality was so startling I felt compelled to write my first review (and a negative one at that) after finally completing Ragen's book. She had fascinating material to work with; what a shame the end result was embarrassingly poor."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I really like Naomi Regan's books, but this one is an exception. The story is told of a family that goes from lower middle class to extreme poverty. The book seems to focus on just how horrible life is without money. The only bright note in the entire story is when it focuses on the middle child who is bright, articulate and looks to religion and education as a way out of the depths her family has sunk into. Not worth the time it took to read it or the money spent on it."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I stumbled upon this book while browsing and had it not been for my own personal experiences growing up likewise in a Queens Housing Project, I never would have purchased the book. After reading the first few intense pages of \\"Chains aound the grass\\" that's when it had a grip on me and I was then sold.Still, one need not have been raised poor and living in the projects to experience the fright and sheer terror little Sara felt while venturing out in a new neighborhood filled with bullies, perverts and strange boys. One of the most powerful chapters written by Naomi Regan that will have you in tears. You will surely absorb the emotional impact of one diaster after the other of ones family life encounters. A story of a family's uphill struggle for the American dream followed by a downward trend of personal tragedies and defeats. No doubt that your heart will go out to the characters in the story. An exciting read for enthusiasts of nostalgia and of past times with a hint of spiritualism."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I read Naomi Ragen's weekly columns in the Jerusalem Post religiously. But I could not understand when she said this was what she had lived her whole life to write. Then I read the book.This autobiographical novel of family resilience distills many truths that obviously took a lifetime to learn--truths that melt bitterness.The book weaves several layers together--a of a family's travails, its near ruin in a tangle of poverty, bad decisions and relationships gone sour; a soul's awakening; and family renewal. The poetry of all three resonates throughout in a voice as subtle and profound as it is sensible.Ragen has given few details when she notes that readers will all feel sure that their &quot;own knowledge would have kept you safe,&quot; and then warns, &quot;Of course, you'd be fooling yourself.&quot;Poetry comes in what follows: &quot;It is a false security, that feeling of superiority we have listening to someone else recount the steps to personal disaster because all of us are so very similar--we humans. We feel safe only because the teller is untalented, the truth unconveyed. And so, you must consider the soft building dust underfoot, the newness of the place.&quot;One can only relish Ragen's description, some time later, of a child discovering the value of her own life. &quot;She dropped to her knees, breathless, aware of her own heart pounding like some stranger begging to be let in.... She lay down in the sand. First she wiggled her toes, feeling the air pass through them like the cold touch of metal. She felt a strong sudden consciousness of her ankles and the firm muscles of her calves, the long wonderful stretch of skin, so smooth and soft, that ran from her toes to her hips. She felt aware of her stomach and the softly beating heart in her chest and her mouth and her nose and eyes and ears.&quot;A nameless joy began to rise inside her, wavelike. She felt it spread, as a wave of breaks and spreads, touching the far-off shore, flooding the sand in a quick deliberate flood. A sudden searing light, like the sun, pierced what had been dark and cold and filled with fear.&quot; 'I'm alive!' she thought, and was comforted.&quot;Have we not all been in that place? The same child still later astonishes herself and readers with her discovery of her soul and place in the universe. The sense of discovery alone makes this wise novel worth reading. But the book also rewards readers with intense optimism, even when its characters are at their lowest.With the same poetry that the book opens, it closes: &quot;The echoes moved out of the corners, beating like wingless birds around the room.&quot;I cannot recommend this book or author highly enough. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"This beautifully written tale brings the impoverished Markowitz family to life as their American Dream turns into a nightmare. Set in the 1950's in the projects in The Bronx, those &quot;chains around the grass&quot; are metaphoric as well as physical for little Sara. Her strength of character comes from the strength of her faith and is a wondrous thing to behold. The autobiographical nature of this novel makes it a heart wrenching and compelling read."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I typically love Naomi Ragen's book, but this one left a lot to be desired. I believe that she felt that she needed to write a book and this is the first thing that came out of her pen.While the first half of the book is the story of Dave, the husband, the second half is the story of no one. Depsite the fact that the back of the book leads you to believe it is about the daughter, Sara, she is not the main character in any sense.There is no story for you to follow and the characters don't develop well. Their characteristics just sort of \\"appear.\\"The Jewish thread seems manufactured as if she had to insert it somewhere.If you want to read a bood Naomi Ragen book, read ANY of the others."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"Naomi Ragen's four previous novels dealt with Orthodox Jews and their personal problems and struggles. These novels were intensely human, very frank and controversial. In a departure from these themes, Ragen's new novel, \\"Chains Around the Grass,\\" focuses on the unfortunate Markowitz family and their myriad personal problems.The time is the 1950's and David Markowitz, husband of Ruth, and father of three children, is again forcing the family to move, for the fourth time in ten years. He is a dreamer who thinks that one day he will strike it rich, and his family will then have the life that they deserve. For the time being, however, the Markowitz family is moving into a low-income housing project in Far Rockaway, Queens, while David plies his trade as a taxicab driver.\\"Chains Around the Grass\\" does not succeed, mostly because Ragen has no central focus beyond describing the family's miserable lives. She touches on many themes, but they do not coalesce into a satisfying whole. Ruth Markowitz stays at home with the children, as was traditional in the pre-feminist fifties, although she has few domestic skills. Her considerable brains and talent are underutilized, which contributes to her depression and keeps the family income low. David is a charming but unstable man. He fights with his relatives who are better off than he, and he is simply unable to work at a steady job long enough to make good. None of these themes has enough resonance to make the novel come alive.The book does have its poignant moments, especially those that center around the middle-child, Sarah. She is an excellent student, who believes that school and perhaps religion will be her ticket out of her dead-end existence. However, Ragen does not show us what is unique about this family and why their story is worth telling. \\"Chains Around the Grass\\" is little more than a very bleak story about a very unhappy family."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK.It made me laugh outloud and it made me cry.Mostly it made me think.This is a story about real life and not the usual immigrant founding a dynasty cliche.All of the characters are well devoloped and I found myself loving them and hating them as if they were members of my own family.And of course they could have been.The universal message of what the measure of a man is is profoundly moving especially in our materialistic world."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I agree with another reviewer who said that the obviously autobiographical nature of this book would have been better as a memoir than disguise of fiction. Ms. Ragen treats the entire book as fiction until the last chapter, when she clearly reverts to autobiography; the switch is somewhat out of place for someone who has written such concise fiction in the past. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"Naomi Ragen is an international bestseller novelist, a writer of and about the core of human life. Chains Around the Grass (The Toby Press, USA, 2003) is the book Ms. Ragen says that she became an author to write. Setting the story of a poor Jewish family in the heart of America, Naomi Ragen calls for a revision of attitudes shaped by the sickness of reckless capitalism and its people who have turned into machines fuelled with business.The novel's prologue is captivating. Through the eyes of the moment, little Sara Markowitz is shown sitting in humility in her rich uncle's house with her mother Ruth and brother Jesse out for the funeral of her father David Markowitz. Pursuing the old American dream of a well-off future, David never realizes the greater need of familial love that is showering him all along and the lives of his family chug along the uncertain paths of the business world. With the loss of David the family slumps into an indefinable channel of struggle against the demands of the society and its own integrity.Chains Around the Grass is one of the semantically richest works carrying a number of issues. Sick capitalist values are questioned in the suffering of widowed Ruth and her children with several close, rich, relatives. The dilemma of a poor minority's identity under social pressure speaks in Ruth's resentment of changing Jesse's family name to \`Marks'. What underlies insanity is illustrated cogently in Jesse's character. Sara's character embodies the process of personality development under early childhood traumas. The best explored is, perhaps, gender inequality prevailing in the social world, best instantiated in Sara's feelings of hatred towards her own brother.Naomi Ragen's striking symbolism in her novel's situations is the quality of her work that best complements other merits. The heaven of idealized life is shattered to \`chips flying away under time's relentless chisel'. When they were united and beautiful like young lush grass, they were out of reach on account of \`chains' around them. One set of \`ropes' is replaced with another and the dream of catching your life's beauty is never actualized until you see your life's time ending abruptly like a dream. Naomi Ragen is at her best in justice with her characters. Reality comes to them as they finally learn to \`measure their life with the right yardstick'. Through Ruth's faith, we all know that a purely humanistic relationship is possible if we know the beauty of our inner self. It is an illustration of Eric Fromm's humanistic psychoanalysis; a story as real as reading one's own mind.With all its beauty of language and elements of realistic fiction, Chains Around the Grass carries a problem as a book. The title and the prologue are suggestive of Sara as being the protagonist. It is through Sara's eyes that the tenderness of life and monsters of fear are revealed to us but Sara's character is treated scantily as compared to that of her parents and her brother Jesse. Essentially it is the story of Ruth's life. Her figure could have given a better illustrative title and prologue."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I've read other books by this author and couldn't even finish this one. It was an extremely depressing story and there was far too much philosophical mumble-jumble. Read her other books instead."},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I am a huge fan of Naomi Ragen's earler books, but this one was a real disappointment! Except for the few rays of hope at the books' beginning and its end, I found it to be extremely depressing. If Ragen wanted to share her life story with her devoted fans, a memoir may have been a better genre than fiction; we would have had much more compassion and sympathy for the pitiful and pitiable family. Her new writing style is awkward and contrived...she seemed to be grasping for too many metaphors and descriptions. I am afraid that her readers will be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Chains Around the Grass","review":"I have loved every book written by Naomi Ragen.

This book remedied that shortcoming. The author not only describes the campaigns in sufficient detail, he also is able to provide an overview that is most enligtening. It is fascinating to contemplate this war in light of the events of 1914 and 1940. This is simply an excellent book."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"After reading the \\"Guns of August\\" I was intrigued by many of the German generals who had fought in the Franco-Prussian War. After reading Wawro's book you can't help but be struck by the fact that this war was the beginning of the cycles of German aggression in Europe culminating in WWII.Even though I enjoy war history books I usually start to fade when the orders of battle, tactics, etc. are discussed. Wawro does a good job of making this interesting and weaved into the bigger picture. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think the author does a good job of pointing out the bravery of French soldiers. It is simply hard to argue with the outcome: the French army defeated and Paris besieged.Read this book and then quickly follow up with a good book on WWI."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"This book is very scholarly and is a rather fair account of the Franco-Prussian war. It is not too short, nor is it overly long. It is not indepth enough to bore you, but not short enough on details to leave you without a very clear knowledge of the events that transpired in 1870-71. The Franco-Prussian war does not, obviously, have very many books written about it. I'll admit, this book is the only one I've read on the subject, but it seems to me that it is very non-biased (both the German's and French's weaknesses and strengths are shown and explained in detail). The causes of the war are clarified very well, as is the aftermath of the war. The battles are explained really well (the major ones especially, not so much the smaller battles at the end of the war, but they aren't necessarily that important anyway).All in all, this was an excellent book, and I am proud to have it in my collection to fill a slot in my German history library."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"A well researched and clear account of the origins, specifics and consequences of a critical war.My only gripe is that, once again, publishers do not seem to invest in the e-book format. While common errors (typos...) are avoided, it still feels like a unimaginative scan of a paper product."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"For a conflict that lit a fuse to 1914 this war has received little attention from historians. The book certainly provided many unanswered questions. It reinforced my opinion of the carnival folly of Napoleon III and the astounding ineptitude of the army of the Second Empire despite their superiority in infantry weaponry. It provided a further insight into the murderous impact of industrial era war on mass armies that was revealed in the American Civil War. The irony of General Sheridan being an observer with the German army. I visited the Sedan battlefield last year and wished I had read this beforehand as the French do not showcase defeats very well. The British are more used to it. The book also gave me some context for the Prince Imperial, having visited the lonely site of his death when he was oddly a Lieutenant in the British Army in Zululand."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"My family migrated to the US to escape the Franco-Prussian War.I was looking for the reasons for this emigration, and certainly foundthem, Prussian Manditory Conscription. The battle detail was more thanI needed, but the sweeping events prompted me to read more historyfrom the French perspective. It seems the more things change, the more they remain the same."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"This is an excellent book, at least it seems so to me. I knew nothing about the Franco-Prussian war, and I bought this book to inform myself. I live in France, and I thought I needed to know a bit more of the history. Since I have absolutely no background in the subject, I can't express opinions, as other reviewers have, on the quality of the research, the handling of the facts, or the accuracies of the conclusions. But the book appears incredibly thorough and well documented, the writing is fresh and lively, and the author provides really interesting descriptions of battles. That said, I have stopped reading because the horrors of the battlefield are hard to take in quantity, especially with some of the personal recollections of suffering and death. Maybe it's because I'm a girl that this is all a bit indigestible. But the stories are extremely well told, and I think that anyone with an interest in military history would find this book superb. And now I know a bit more about this war and its causes. It sort of confirms my opinion that the French would prefer a good table to a good skirmish or a good day's work anytime. It is clearly a war of transition to the modern world, and the book in interesting in making this clear. And it all took place about the time my grandfather was born...odd to note such a connection. I read this book in Kindle format on my IPhone, and the maps were a bit hard to deal with, but I found all the military maneuvers somewhat hard to follow--this is me, not a problem with the book--and so I didn't especially care that the maps were small."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Wawro's exhaustively researched book details the runup to the outbreak of war, the relatively short but bloody campaign, and the aftermath of Germany's decisive victory over France. As the narrative progresses the reader begins to see why the Germans were, at one point, \\"War's own children\\", to quote from an Alan Furst novel. The Franco-Prussian war solidified a lethal mix of Prussian militarism, fanatical devotion to country, and racism that would wreak so much destruction in two world wars."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"This book provides a pretty good overview of the Franco-Prussian War, and I certainly learned a lot about the war. However, there are a few frustrating characteristics of the author's approach. First, the author repeatedly buried what I would consider to be monumental events (i.e., the commencement of armed hostilities, the commencement of the shelling of Paris, the proclamation unifying Germany, the signing of the armistice, and the signing of the peace treaty) within paragraphs. Some of these events just seem to have popped out of nowhere in the narrative. While he focused extensively on details of battles, the author provided shockingly little discussion or analysis of events such as those just mentioned. In addition, the author did not do a great job of describing simultaneously occurring events, often writing in detail about events in one region of France, then jumping back in time to write about events in another region. It seems that the entirety of the conflict could have been described in a more cohesive fashion.Overall, the book is a useful overview of the war, but contains some troubling flaws."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Having previously read Wawro's somewhat tedious and dry account of the Austro-Prussian War, I did not expect much from this volume. However, I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a much more lively, readable account of war in this text. The historical narrative moves much more quickly and is full of fascinating insights into why France performed so miserably in a war its leaders thought could be won easily. The text is supplemented with some very clear maps (unlike the other volume) as well. Wawro's account of the Franco-Prussian War is that rare work of history that masterfully blends the bigger picture (political events, international diplomacy, military strategy, etc.) with the smaller picture where we learn about the personalities, the people, and the experiences associated with the triumphs and tragedies of this war. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"this is an outstanding book, wonderfully written. in every page of this book, the author demonstrates total command of language and details. read this book if you want to understand the great war and the development of the german military machine that took on the world twice in the 20th century. if there is one thing this book demonstrates, it is that the french fighting man, though lacking in the discipline department, though prone to joie de vivre, is as courageous as the fighting man of any other country. it is his bad fortune to be continually led by indecisive political leaders and incompetent military commanders. any good history of the great war will show that the french soldier suffered and endured horrifically but never broke. in world war 2, for weeks after dunkirk, the french army continued to resist heroically. frankly, no army in the world could have withstood the superior tactics and equipment of the german army of 1940. any book about dien bien phu would show how french commanders blundered badly but the french soldier still fought his heart out almost to the very end. these days, it's fashionable to refer to the french as \\"surrender monkeys\\", as if the french soldier never had heart for a fight after Napoleon, but anyone who does that is facile in thinking and doesn't know much about history."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Wawro succeeds again in bringing life to an often underappreciated episode in modern European history. The Franco-Prussian War is covered in textbooks, but Wawro fleshes it out in marvelous detail, fully explaining not only the military side of the war, but the politics as well. Readers will gain insight into late 19th-century warfare and its eerie foretelling of wars to come."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"This isn't a substitute for wading through Sir Michael Howard's tome.

If you want to read only one book on the Franco-Prussian war, you won't go wrong here. If you've read Howard, then it isn't going to provide any revelations."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"After reading the previous lengthly reviews, I have decided to add this insight to this book. Its appears that the author is trying to show how the French lost the war then how the Germans won it. Its seem pretty clear from the author's perception that French were pretty incompetenece from the top on down. But that didn't make it a sure thing for the Germans. The author also pointed out that Germans showed plenty of ineptitude of their own during the war. What made the difference between the two was that French military incompetenece and their reliance on their famed Chassepot rifle couldn't off-set German professionalism and their artillery - both elements which proves to be the main factors why the French lost.I was also reminded that the French army of 1870 looked a lot like the French army of 1940. In both cases, the French were military incompetent and their leadership at the top were totally brain dead. The courage of the individual French soldiers kept them in the game as long as they could but Germans won out in the end. Both times, it was a speedy victory for the Germans.I thought this book was well written, nicely researched and easy to read. It doesn't bogged you down with overwhelming details and its theme seem to be pretty clear from the beginning and it was from that point of view that the book seem to be written for. Well recommended even for casual reader, I agreed with one previous reviewer that this book won't replaced Howard's book but its a great fresh look."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"This is an excellent book on the first modern war. A war which did so much to shape the modern world as the results helped lead the world towards the catastrophe of 1914. Fast paced and easy to read, it is perhaps more acessable to the general public than the other excellent one volume history in English by Michael Howard. Should be read in conjunction with the author's other book on the war of 1866."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"I really enjoyed this book.The author does a superb job in explaining how this war got started and gives us a very profound and interesting insight as to how the french and the prussians saw the upcoming war.I especially enjoyed the authors account of Napoleon III.His indecision and lack of initiative was harmful to France.The description of the battles are very good and filled with the human touch.I recommend this book to anybody"},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Wawro's book is a concise and thrilling account of the Franco-Prussian War. Wawro covers the battles, politics, and personalities of this short and decisive European conflict with energy and skill."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"I will address the first item first, why only 4 stars? This book has no index of weapons and that is very important. There are 4 weapons which play a huge role in this war: There are the Mitrailleuse, C64 (field gun), Chassepot and Dreyse rifles. If a person does not know of the Mitrailleuse it's an analog of the US Gatling gun, the C64 is the first mass deployed breech loading cannon firing a metallic shell with a super quick point detonationing fuse, the Chassepot fires a fixed cartridge through a bolt action with superior ballistics, and the Dreyse needle gun fires a round that is ballistically inferior while using a more primitive needle fire ignition system.Now, I really liked this book and it is very true that the Franco-Prussian war is the war that is truly the introduction to the destruction of the Great War of 1914 - 1918.Perhaps this is a spoiler but this last story in the book bears repeating because it gives insight into the Prussian (German) mind of the time. Field Marshall Von Bismarck visits his son, Herbert, who was wounded in the fighting. His son is at a field hospital located in a barn in France. While at the hospital Von Bismarck sees the farmer's chickens and asks the surgeon why the chickens have not been cooked and fed to the soldiers. The surgeon replies \\"Herr Field Marshall, the chickens are not government property. They are owned by the farmer.\\" Von Bismarck almost pulls out his wallet to pay the farmer 23 francs for the chickens, thinks a minute, and puts his wallet back. He is a Field Marshall, his word is law, and the Doctor is told to do what he is ordered.While the killing of Wissembourg, Spicheren, Mars-La-Tour,Gravelotte, and the Battle of Sedan are shocking the one thing the author manages to get across to his reader is there is no redeeming qualities to this war. Abraham Lincoln says \\"the 'better angels of our nature'\\" in comments about the American Civil War. Mary Chesnut, a plantation owner of the south, laments of a terrible price to pay in the treatment of Union prisoners. Lincoln, Chesnut, and the whole of the North and South lamented over the terrible business of the American Civil War. There is none of that from the Prussians.The carnage of this book is simply shocking. The number of soldiers killed in a battle has that surreal Great War body counts. I was also surprised over the Prussian indifference toward the numbers of the dead. It was almost like a good German was expected to help empty the cartridge boxes of the French soldiers by offering up their body as a target. In the American Civil War General Sherman was told \\"a negro soldier can stop a bullet as well as a white soldier.\\" Sherman replies \\"that is best done by a sand bag.\\" Moltke and Von Bismarck merely expect the men to do their duty and die.The author does a great job in observations of the French Army. By 1870 the French were so screwed up that a person gets the impression they can't do anything correct. I was surprised at how many of the French generals didn't know when to counter attack.I was also surprised by the poor behavior of the Prussian soldiers. At this time the typical German was one of the most educated people in the world. All German children were pretty much required to have attended K-8 grades in either Lutheran or Catholic schools. All were either good Catholic or Lutherans. Yet the Prussians were absolute barbarians looting, drinking, and shooting French insurgents with abandon while putting whole villages to the torch. It was quite ironic that one of the foreign observers was Union General Sheridan who was an officer in the Army that \\"made the South howl\\". But the Prussians more than made the French howl and for no good reason than mere conquest. It is the taking of land and killing for no better than because the Field Marshall commands it.The book makes it clear that the war ends with no good will towards a united Germany. I really like the analysis of the author. Oh, copying the Prussians became de rigueur in the 1880s with oddities like the US Army copying the Pickelhaube. But the war ends with everybody looking at Germany like a bully who not only beats his opponent but then proceeds to abuse his opponent. Germany is civilized, yes. However, in its character Prussia is mean. That surprises all the other western nations. I had thought that the breech with Britain started with the battleship building program and that's covered well in the bookDreadnought. However, the first unease of Germany's unification is with the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian war.This book is in the top 5% of all war books I've read because the analysis is so spot on. Yes, I took off a star because there is no presentation of the weapons of the war. That is important. Also, and this is a Kindle whine, the maps don't show up on the screen worth a darn. I didn't know that most of the battles were inside of 100 miles of Trier (close to Luxemburg), Germany.Still, the book is more than worthwhile. Also, what will strike the reader is the difference between the Franco-Prussian war and the American Civil War. The American Civil War ends slavery and establishes - however painfully - the eventual equality of races. The Franco-Prussian war merely establishes Germany as the bully on the block and this all comes to a head in the Great War and World War II. It ends with Soviet Soldiers standing in the pulverized ruins of Berlin. And how that all really starts is a Field Marshall didn't do the right thing. He does the thing his power allows him to do. That correctly observed Prussian character fault is the thesis of this book."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"No understanding of WWI is complete without knowing about the Franco-Prussian War. Unforunately, my BA in History in 1965 left a void. None of my assigned text books, or courses as I recall left me with the correct version of the war. Wawro writes a well documented scholarly depiction that describes the War between the War to End All Wars.Had Waro left out some of the numerous battles and places that I had difficulty following. (I read this on a Kindle,and they should do someting about Maps). I enjoyed the parts of the texts that described the difference of weapons, strategies and grasped the idea of how they affected the outcome of the war.From the text, I am convinced that unlike WWI, the country that declared War was France. I am certain that both sides wanted war, but Bismark out foxed France by having France declare War. An important factor in determining who pays who if there is a tie.Who ever edited this book should have cut the descriptions of the battles. Perhaps one or two of them could have given the reader a taste of the differences between the fighting style of both sides. The difference in the rifles which gave the French an Advantage were offset by the Krupps artillery. I think I got the idea, and that fact seemed overdone. I was not aware that the French military resembled a bureacracy of professional soldiers, who were excellent riflemen, but were career soldiers who remained in the army until they retired, well past their prime of life. On the other hand, the Germans had literate young men who could read maps and take written orders. And as a former military person, I am well aware that the young take orders more easily than older men, who have wives and children.The author leaves the reader that the Germans were not supermen on the battlefield, or that the French troops were not. The author does make a point that the Germans were lead by superior officers, who took chances, fought offensively and were better equiped.My primarily reason for reading this work was laid out in the last chapters. The author does explain why Bismark utimately failed by making a united Germany a threat to the Balance of Power. He does mention the fact that the Major Powers-France, Britain,Russia and Austria-Hungary wanted to eliminate any countries that wanted to join the club of great powers. For centuries, there wasn't a Germany, nor an Italy. Both were cut up to maintain that balance. The author seems to avoid that Germany may not have existed on the maps before Bismark, but it was a nation cememented together by a common language and two Christian religions. The Franco-Prussian War ended the tension between the Catholic South,and the Northern Luterns, after years of bitterness following the Reformation. The author describes the difficulty religion played in France during the War. Conservative Catholics in the cities and the peasants were antagonists during the War. Germany had its problems with the liberal wings within its borders, but not to the extent in France.The author describes the hatreds that grew out of this war, which were quite evident when WWI began. The new and powerful nation Bismark built was being matched by France's revamping its military and weapons development. France was expected to defeat Germany. As a result, Britan and Russia did not participate. In WWI, France had them as allies, and eventually brought the US into the War."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"The Franco-Prussian War may be the most unknown of &quot;modern&quot; conflicts: like most people, I was aware that the French army was destroyed at Sedan, but knew little else. This book remedied that shortcoming. The author not only describes the campaigns in sufficient detail, he also is able to provide an overview that is most enligtening. It is fascinating to contemplate this war in light of the events of 1914 and 1940. This is simply an excellent book."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"What a book! While I'm not a professional reviewer and I'm not even a reviewer of the stature of many of the other folks on Amazon, I hope I can give some valuable input. I absolutely haven't covered every base here, but these are the things that struck me the most.Dealing with the cards that Bismarck had in his hand, the crafty politician absolutely turned Europe inside and out during the 1880's and 1870's. It would seem that every single opportunity that Bismarck had to make Prussia better for His Majesty and His Majesty's subjects, that exactly what Bismarck was able to do.Even if you don't like Bismarck, you had to - you were literally forced to- respect the count, general, and prince. With just as much respect that you hold in the name of Bismarck, you have to hold the same in disdain for Louis Napoleon III. What an imbecile. The French lost the war, not to lack of ability, armament, or even strategy, but due to the likes of Napoleon III and his lethargic generals. The following was an excerpt simply talking about the Council of War meeting with Napoleon and his generals, including the freshly brought forward Bazaine from Mexico - \\"No wonder Napoleon III and his staff pressed Bazaine for answers; the war would unquestionably begin as a series of linked strategic movements with the Prussians trying to break into Alsace-Lorraine, and the French into the Rhineland or Franconia. Someone the French headquarters needed to mark the way forward, but no one did\\" [p. 72].This is really the tell all how they failed. They literally failed by not doing. Bazaine was chased around the entire country side of northern France and the Prussians held him in a siege that wasted away his entire army; he simply refused to make strategic decision and refused to fight, even with a better equipped army!The thing about this war that amazed me second to the ineptness of the Emperor and his generals was how the war was started. Either Bismarck was an incredibly brilliant political strategist or the French leaders, including Napoleon III, were complete fools when it came to politics. You take your pick. While reading the book, when I learned that France declared war on Germany, I was astounded. Completely blown away. It was pure stupidity.In conclusion, Wawro was harsh on Bismarck in the last chapter on the lasting effects of the Franco-Prussian war. Everything from France getting their act together politically and strategically in the 1890's through to the Great War, on into how the great German state forced an incredible arms race with Russia, the U.K's activism, America's waning isolationism, ect, ect. I don't know what to make of it all. If Germany had not unified, are you telling me the art of war would have not further evolved and Russia wouldn't act like Russia always acts, and the U.K wouldn't try to be the quasi-isolated bully they've always been, and that the republicans of France would've been happy? I seriously doubt it."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"I read this a s a follow-on to a good book on the Crimean War.

I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in military history or the Franco-Prussian war."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"This book exemplifies the reason for the existence of the non-fiction genre of military history.For some, this is a book about how a nation can start and then fail to successfully fight a war. Yet for military history enthusiasts like myself, this is something much more than that. It is military history of the first order, and a \\"must read.\\"Why do I say that?Yes, Geoffrey Wawro tells us a familiar story: the oft-told tale of yet another national military defeat. And yes, this one occurred a long time ago, almost a century and a half ago. So why should this possibly be considered \\"must reading?\\"It turns out that this little known war has much to teach about the future. It happens to be a crystal ball. It foretells to the French nation almost everything that it would need to know on how to fight the Germans in the coming two world wars. Moreover, it tells them how to win those wars quickly and efficiently. It is an oracle.This is why it is must reading now for all military history readers. It teaches us.For you willing to take up my challenge, I encourage you to read beyond this oft-told tale of inept leaders of listless and muddled soldiers unwisely taking up arms against the insightful and opportunistic leaders of energetic and disciplined soldiers. I ask you to ponder the lessons beyond the predictable result: usually disaster for the former (in this case the soldiers of France) and victory for the latter (the soldiers of Prussia). I implore you to think about what it tells you about the coming wars of the twentieth century. If you do so, I think that you will agree with me that it tells the future. With a little application it will teach you what the French should have learned, but apparently did not do so.In essence, this book exemplifies why the genre of military history exists, to learn.Readers of general history have much to gain from this as well. If understanding variations in neighboring national cultures is your interest, there is much to learn here. However, I must warn you that the evidence of French incompetence in drawing up its national policy and the subsequent execution of the applicable military strategy and tactics is so disheartening that reading about it could make you depressed. This may be so even if you are a closet supporter for the cause of Prussia.Read this book. Ponder its implications. Learn."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"I will begin this review by saying that I enjoyed the book and learned a lot from it. My four star rating is definitely a thumbs up.Now I will start criticizing. My first complaint is that the author leads us by the nose to one conclusion, then does a 180 and leads us to the opposite conclusion, half a dozen times.For example, he makes a very strong case that Bismarck was guilty of demanding far too much from France at the war's end, placing the blame on Bismarck. Fine. The territorial demands (Alsace-Lorraine, etc.) and the reparations demanded by Bismarck in 1871 bring World War One to mind.Then he turns right around and tells us that Bismarck wasn't at fault at all, but was in fact trying to reign in the demands of those around him. You can't have it both ways.He does the same earlier, a number of times. It is a pattern of his. He convinces us, for example, that the French should have been more aggressive militarily in this or that situation, and a page later he tells us that such a course would have been suicidal.I believe that if I had been sitting next to him as he wrote this book, and had drawn his attention to his flipflopping by screaming WHAT!!!, he would have edited his book and corrected this fault. He does it over and over.In one section, a certain general is horrible, and in the next, that same general was right all along, and a bit further on, he was a moron. It is not a question of the general sometimes on target and sometimes not. It is flipflopping about the same man doing the same things, interpreted differently from one page to the next.Let's be clear on who our morons are and who our tacticians are. Should the man have broken out of his position or not? We really can't have it both ways.The strongest part of the book may be the last few pages. Wawro explains that the reason for World War One was not France's fury at the demands of Bismarck, the reparations and the land grab for Alsace-Lorraine. The French were well past all that.He blames World War One (and Two) on the legitimacy given to militaristic (...), the Prussian elite, thanks to their victory in France. The Franco Prussian War made these ignorant and selfish sons of b.....s into heroes who seemed to know what they were talking about. The victory legitimized the use of war for nationalistic gain. It overly impressed the German people, who then followed other militaristic (...) into one disaster after another.Wawro also makes the point that the arch-conservative Prussians were too stubborn for their own good, opposing the French republicans, not realizing that those same republicans (anti-monarchists) were a bulwark against a complete overturning of the system as later occurred in Russia.I would compare it to relieving some pressure in order to save what can be saved. The arch-conservatives were rejecting the moderate conservatives, and would only be satisfied if a lunatic fringe conservative right ruled all of Europe. But you can't win that way. It only opens the door to revolution. So the Prussians were shown to be fools with their ultra-conservatism, destroying their own house. I don't see a Kaiser in Berlin today, so they obviously didn't succeed.Much of this book repeats to us that the French were a pack of idiots during the Franco-Prussian War. It's easy to say in hindsight that the losers were a bunch of morons.The military lesson of this book is that heavy artillery trumps infantry. The side with the biggest cannons will beat the side with the best rifles. To take it further along in history, the side with the massed tanks will beat the side without massed tanks. Whoever has the biggest fist wins. Blitzkrieg in a nutshell.That would seem to be a pretty good rule of thumb, although the Pittsburgh Pirates did manage to beat the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series. Let's say that the guy with the biggest fist usually wins, but not always.I can't fathom anyone accusing the French of cowardice in this war. The descriptions of battle are horrific. Shells are exploding all around, ripping bodies to shreds. In the face of all that, soldiers of both armies are racing forward in the teeth of rapid fire shooting. My God! Courage is taken to insane heights. How can these people be criticized for lack of it?As the book 1984 argues, anyone can be broken down. You can take the bravest hero, subject him to something he can't deal with, and he'll break.This world is a dangerous place. If you don't get it in war, if you protect yourself in every imaginable way, you still aren't safe from the ravages of cancer. We can criticize humanity's lack of the kind of love that Jesus spoke of, or even of a simple live and let live attitude. We can criticize humanity's endless, eternal stupidity. But we can't criticize humanity's courage. We are really up against it, and so were the soldiers described in this book."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Mr. Wawro had already produced a in many respects interesting book on the Six Week's War of 1866, enriched by quantities of impressive documentation (yet inexplicably lacking serious Italian material). This newest work is a natural progression of its predecessor, and again displays a not inconsiderable wealth of detail. Wawro makes excellent use of French and, especially, Bavarian archival sources that have often been neglected in previous histories, and weaves a very compelling narrative of the battle of Wissembourg. It appears Wawro has consciously sought to emulate Sir Michael Howard's 1961 history of the war, going so war as even titling it in nearly identical terms. And, in some respect, Wawro has gone his model one better, infusing his narrative with much drama by the use of many dramatic first hand accounts.But it seems Howard's epigone has carried admiration too far, for his history ultimately adds nothing new of import while at the same time repeating the errors and lacunae of its model. Both Howard and Wawro miss the critical military factor underlying the war's outbreak--Prussia's imminent deployment of the Aptierung Beck, a vastly improved rifle which would nearly have evened the odds against German infantry. Beyond this, Wawro indulges in a good deal of conceptualization, blithely cherry-picking his way to an idealized portrayal of Prussian Auftragstaktik which, outside of the printed page and the parade ground, surely bears no resemblance to what actually took place during the climactic battles of 1870.We may also note that Wawro's attempts at rhetorical flair, though not uniformly infelicitous, mar rather than add to his work's quality. The footnoting also seems to follow a rather opaque pattern, referencing the most anodyne facts while at the same time failing to provide footnotes for other categorical statements and judgments on more controversial issues. To be deplored also, are regrettable and avoidable errors of logic and fact as well as instances of carelessness; of which we may cite several examples : in one section Wawro cites an Austrian (which he labels as \`Prussian', even though according to his footnote it appears in the &Ouml;stereischiche Milit&auml;r Zeitung) article of 1868 as a reference for the combat shortcomings of the Mitrailleuse--the ancestor of the modern machine gun which was being secretly developed by the French. One fails to understand how such an article, written two years before the weapon was ever used in action (or, indeed, its existence truly established, since it was a \`secret' weapon) can be employed to substantiate its practical deficiencies. In describing the skirmish at Sarrebourg, Wawro describes the Prince Imp&eacute;rial \`gathering spent cartridges'--quite impossible, since the Chassepot fired a consumable cartridge; perhaps he meant \`bullet'?In another more serious logical lapse, Wawro states that immediately prior to the battle of Froeschwiller, Napoleon III, disquieted by reports of the French defeat at Spicheren, contemplated the withdrawal of Marshal Mac-Mahon's Army of the Rhine. But this reasoning makes little sense, because the battles of Spicheren and Froeschwiller took place simultaneously--on the 6th of August--and the defeat at Spicheren did not become clear until after seven o'clock in the evening, after the battle of Froeschwiller had ended.In an instance of a factual faux-pas, Wawro attributes thirty-seven barrels to the Mitrailleuse when it actually had twenty-five, and likens it to the American Gatling gun, calling it a \`revolver canon', whereas the breech of the French gun does not revolve. In addition to such flaws--which, if their magnitude is not great, still undermine the book through their prevalence--the author's translations do not always inspire the greatest of confidence, as when he translates the French foire (a county fair, or a term denoting chaos) as \`barracks.' His German translations are also questionable at times, as in his rendering of a Prussian officer's words during the battle of Gravelotte-Saint Privat, where Wawro translates \\"Wer hier nicht bei mir bleibt, den schiesse ich nieder!\\" as \`I'll shoot down anyone who doesn't stop here!' (the more literal--and clearer--translation is \`Whoever doesn't stay with me here, I'll shoot down!'). Overall, the book, while containing a great deal that is of interest, seems to suffer from the effects of excessive haste in preparation, and could have stood more proof-reading.In the main Wawro hews to the traditional and, in many ways, deceptively simplistic conceptualizations of the war--evidently inspired by a heterogeneous brew of post-war French self-flagellation on one hand and, as Michael Howard aptly put it, German \`Schw&auml;rmerei,'on the other. He continues to repeat the old line of the French artillery's technological inferiority, insisting repeatedly on the superiority of the Krupp breech loading steel guns versus the muzzle-loading bronze canon of the French. Yes, there was a technological inferiority on the French side, but it was not nearly as marked as the author believes; French artillery suffered from primitive fuses, but the German canon certainly did not fire twice as fast, no much more accurately, nor even at longer ranges. Although the author rightfully underlines the very effective use of artillery by the Prussians (its concentration and aggressive employment), he treads the well-trodden path of superficiality and generalization followed by his precursors and does not mention the single most significant considerations about artillery in the war of 1870: the numerical edge of German artillery, which amounted to some 1,600 canon facing 700 French, which meant that a Prussian divisional salvo consisted of 24 shells weighing 135 kilogrammes versus only 12 shells weighing 52 kilogrammes for the French. Compared to such a marked quantitative disparity, the insubstantial technological argument of German technological superiority evaporates.Particularly objectionable is a reference Wawro makes to Ardant du Picq, pejoratively representing the French military thinker as arguing \\"that the \`moral action' of inspired troops could overcome the \`destructive action' of inanimate guns' (p. 174) and subsuming his thought to the notoriously disastrous French tactics of 1914. This amounts to a gross misreading of du Picq, as just one quotation from du Picq should suffice to demonstrate :\\"The whole of the science of combat lies then in the happy, proper combination, of theopen order, scattered to secure destructive effect, and a good disposition of troops in formation as supports and reserves, so as to finish by moral effect the action of the advanced troops.\\"(Ardant du Picq, Battle Studies, p. 85)Any thorough reading of du Picq should suffice abundantly in establishing that officer's not only sound, but prescient grasp of what modern combat was becoming in 1869-1870; emphasizing moral as well as material factors. In fact, this, in the author's words, \`foolish'du Picq was a great proponent of the practical, real world Prussian tactics (which, incidentally, also laid great stress on the moral element in combat) so lauded by Mr. Wawro.Indeed, so repeated are Wawro's cheap-shots towards the French army (a notable instance being when he mentions a monetary award given to French troops and gratuitously adds that the sum \\"would keep them in wine and prostitutes for weeks\\",p.90), that we are forced to conclude that he is either a rabid Francophobe or a virulent germanophile. Probably the former is the better supposition, judging from a recent article where Wawro attempted to draw a parallel between the Franco-Prussian War and on-going American military operations in Iraq, with the Americans playing the role of the Prussians and the French, comme par hasard, playing the role of those nasty Iraqi supporters of the villainous Saddam Hussein and, in a final flourish, glibly assigned the guilt for the outbreak of the war on the Iraqis...If parallels are to be drawn, one is rather tempted--based on the author's status as an instructor at the Naval War College--to see in the poor planning and bungled execution of Operation Iraqi Freedom that the Leboeufs and Bazaines of the 21st Century, energized by the lectures of the Staff School exegetes like Wawro, have moved from the Seine to the Potomac and found congenial quarters in the Pentagon.Notwithstanding this curious mix of logical and factual missteps, or the incoherent subtext that underlies it, we can recommend this history because of its useful inclusion of first-hand accounts (although Wawro would have done well to include the primary source compilation of French accounts in &Eacute;t&eacute; 1870: La Guerre Racont&eacute;e par les Soldats, Jean-Franois Le Caillon, Paris 2002) to readers already familiar with the war, or those willing to \`round out' their knowledge with less tendentious histories."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"For those of the reading type who have never read anything on the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, Mr. Geoffrey Wawro's 2003 book on the subject is a good place to start. Mr. Wawro brings a 19th-Century European conflict to chaotic and bloody life, illustrating that these pre-World War conflicts were not the chivalric engagements they are often made out to be.The book is structured as if for a lecture at a military university. Beginning with the reasons for the war, the author then moves step-by-step to the make-up of the opposing French and Prussian armies, to the mobilizations and then into a sequential listing of the battles. The prose is clean and very readable, and with the stripped-down structure of the book makes for a generally easily-understandable narrative. (The confusion--at least to this reviewer--is the same type found in most other operational military histories, that of trying to keep up with this Corps staffed by these Regiments who sent forward those Battalions against this Corps...) The battle scenes are brought to life by first-hand accounts dug up by the author from various archives and previous works, making for an engrossing recounting. Illustrated through Mr. Wawro's book is the effect this conflict had on the development of modern warfare, and the precedent it set for the next major European clash that came forty-three years later. The by-the-numbers explanation is what helps make this a great book for beginner students of this short but intense war.On the question of a pro-German bias by the author, the verdict is still out. Even if Mr. Wawro were a \\"Rah-Rah Yay Germans!\\" type it is hard not to see that the Prussians were indeed the better-prepared nation for the duration of the war. The French put up good fights but had abysmal leadership, both on the political and military level. It is a surprise that Marshal Bazaine wasn't tried for gross and treasonous incompetence after the war. The Prussians planned everything as best they could in the scientific, detailed manner for which they've been endlessly stereotyped. The French leadership did little to prep and seemed to believe they would win based on their past greatness alone. While French troops did put devastating Chassepot rifle fire on the massed-infantry attacks the headstrong Prussians frequently resorted to, the 50-Points-for-Planning award would have to go the Germans on this one.The main pet peeve that was needled more than once in this book were the editing errors, from incomplete or awkward sentences to the double-typed words that pop up in places. Overall, The Franco-Prussian War was a good read on an event that is frequently mentioned in Franco-German history but of which much may not be known."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"I was not familiar with this part of history, and wondered if the author could hold my attention. Well written, entertaining and informative, with intelligent judgments and a thoughtful closing chapter."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"For those who beleive that Fance was bullied, tricked or cornered into a war for which it was unprepared, let me recommend David Wetzel's scholarly but readable book, \\"A Duel of Giants.\\" It is the story surrounding Napolean III and Bismark which leads to the war. The war was concieved and nutured by Gramont with the usual collections of lies, truths, half-truths, deceits and pig-headed arrogance. William had no interest in a war, and Bismark was beside himself: on Tuesdays, Thursdays and alternate Saturdays, he was for a war while on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays divisble by 3 he was against the war. The rest of the time was... well, the rest of the time. Napoleon III had no desire for war. Moltke perhaps found the prospect amusing or exciting or desirable, but his ability to influence policy prior to war was of magnitude epsilon for all arbitrarily small epsilon.Wawro's willingness to lay this war at the feet of the Prussians will not hold water. The French, mostly Gramont, pushed for war. And it was done in a way not dissimilar to the US 2003 invasion of Iraq: the facts were first said to be this, then that, then something else. When the French commissions got the politicians pinned down, it was found (surprise, surprise, surprise) the politicians had been lying to the people, to each other and, it would seem, even to themsleves.Professor Wetzel's book is clear that the French pushed the war and that Bismark was wiley enough to turn it to his own self-aggrandizing political ends. Wawro's political anaysis seems to be inapt, which can be the result of politicial or peer pressures which may or may not have been present here.As is pointed out carefully below, Wawro more or less attempts to add up all the guns of all the sizes which then allows him to conlcude the the Prussians should have won but might not have, were the French not over-fed with wine.And Monte shoud have easily triumphed over Rommel, would but Rommel play by set-piece rules. Naughty boy, that Rommel.Simple analysis of the materials of war does not suffice. Adding in the socio-politics is not proof against error. On the road to war there is nearly as much fog as there is in war, belying simple explanations for situations so complex that not even Schrodinger's cat could be sure whether it had survived the opening of the box."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"because the author is so obviously biased and so prone to evaluating things with an all-knowing self-satisfaction. Wawro is clearly a very bright man and has done some excellent research and analysis, but the tone is so off, and he exibits so little empathy for the problems of the French or the reality of the fog of war that it hurts what is overall an admirable operational history. Wawro is not as biased and contemptuous here as he is in his history of the 1866 war between Austria, most of the German States, and Prussia, but at times he comes close. And the last anecdote about the chicken is just embarrassing--I guess that sorry bird is supposed to show us that Germany was on the road to the Holocaust or some such nonsense. Good research and excellent writing, but the great book that Wawro may have in him didn't come to fruition here. I'm hoping that age brings the understanding, tolerance, and empathy that should temper his talent."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"For the past four decades, the most comprehensive English-language history of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 has been Professor Michael Howard's book, first published in 1961. Geoffrey Wawro, the U.S. Naval War college professor who in 1996 wrote an interesting revisionist history of the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, has now written a book to compete with Howard's classic. In a nutshell, Wawro's book is quite good, but it complements rather than replaces Howard's book.Wawro's assessment of the opposing military systems is rather biased in favor of the conscription-based German armies over the smaller French regular army. Wawro focuses on one problematic French regiment and uses it to categorize the entire French army as riddled with poor morale, incompetent leadership and lax discipline. Indeed, Wawro equates alcohol consumption in the French army with unsoldierly behavior - what about the famous alcoholic general named Grant who took Vicksburg seven years before? While Wawro frequently notes drunken German troops later in the campaign, somehow this did not represent German indiscipline. Wawro also makes a big point about the superiority of German pre-war planning, but this is questionable on two accounts. First, the French were hardly alone in lacking detailed contingency war plans in 1870 - few other nations had them either. Second, Wawro admits the German operational plan - to encircle both French armies on the frontier - failed (MacMahon's army escaped to Chalons and while Bazaine's army was encircled, it was due to French lethargy, not the German plan).Wawro's two main theses about the war are continuations of earlier themes from his book on the Austro-Prussian War. His first thesis - that incompetent French leadership was at the root of the defeat - equates General Bazaine's fumbling behavior at Metz with Austrian General Benedek's mistakes at K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. However, there are problems with this thesis. Bazaine had demonstrated real battlefield competence in previous wars, while Benedek was more of a paper-pusher. Bazaine's conduct indicates that political calculations - rather than incompetence - were at the root of the general's failure to act. Furthermore, Bazaine was a mere corps commander in 1870, not commander-in-chief like Benedek, meaning that the Austrian commander was in a much better position to ensure readiness for war and sound operational planning than Bazaine.The author's second thesis is that French defeat was attributable to tactical defects, namely that French superiority in the chassepot rifle was trumped by superior German artillery; these technical disparities made the French troops more defensive-minded while the Germans were more aggressive. It is unfortunate that Wawro does not delve deeper into the opposing infantry and artillery tactics. Both the German and French infantry used large numbers of skirmishers, but the Germans were more inclined to conduct reckless frontal attacks. Neither army had a doctrine for tactical withdrawals, which meant that retreats quickly turned into routs. As for the artillery, the German Krupp breech-loaders were certainly more advanced than the French artillery, but the range advantage was smaller than Wawro suggests only (150 - 750 meters further), giving the German artillerymen a 5-27% advantage in range and 0-60% advantage in rate of fire. German fuses were also better and the Germans pushed their artillery further forward, but none of this added up to a decisive advantage. Wawro fails to note that post-war analysis revealed that only 8% of all casualties were caused by artillery fire, which seriously undermines his tactical thesis.French defeat was primarily due to the haphazard military reforms enacted by Napoleon III. While the emperor did push the chassepot and mitrailleuse, he allowed the legislature to veto funds for artillery modernization and he squandered millions on adventures like Mexico and his own personal embezzlements of public funds. Napoleon III also over-spent on his navy to match English strength, but this fleet was virtually useless against threats from Prussia; a smaller French navy would have provided the manpower for another French corps as well as funds for artillery modernization. The French logistic collapse - never mentioned by Wawro - was caused by lack of preparations for a mobile campaign, such as buying more horses. Once the French army moved away from its supply depots it quickly became an unfed and short of ammunition - is it any wonder that morale deteriorated? German logistics were equally close to collapse once they pushed deep into France, and this over-reliance on distant rail heads would come back to haunt Germany in future wars.Throughout the narrative, I was suspicious that Wawro was concealing facts that indicated French success or German failure. According to Wawro, the French naval blockade of Germany's coast accomplished nothing - he doesn't mention that they captured 80 German merchantmen in the first month of the war. Wawro is reticent about German losses, such as failing to mention the 10,000 German casualties at Froeschwiller. Later, Wawro omits critical details about the French counterattack to relieve Belfort in January 1871; he asserts that the French &quot;sat idly on the road ..[to] Belfort from 10-13 January.&quot; In fact, Howard's account details the French victory at Villersexel on 9 January that led to a 5-mile advance toward Belfort in this period; why does Wawro ignore one of the few French tactical victories?The Franco-Prussian War can be viewed simplistically as a triumph of German aggressiveness and technical skill over French sloth - as Wawro does - or it could be viewed as an opportunistic event where one nation was better placed to exploit temporary advantages. The French army of 1870 was far better than the outcome of the war indicated and indeed, this was probably the best French army the Germans ever fought. In term of casualty ratios, the Germans inflicted 3.8 casualties for everyone of their own in the 1914 invasion of France, 2.5 to 1 in the 1940 campaign but only 0.7 to 1 in the 1870 invasion. Had the French army in 1866 obtained the 13 million francs it needed for artillery modernization, is there any doubt that the results of the Franco-Prussian war would have been much different - Bazaine or no Bazaine?"},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Geoffrey Wawro established himself as a preeminent military historian and author with his previous volumes, &quot;The Austro-Prussian War&quot; and &quot;Warfare and Society in Europe, 1792-1914&quot;. His latest work, &quot;The Franco-Prussian War: The German Conquest of France in 1870-1871&quot; is yet another example of the brilliant research and presentation Mr. Wawro is known for.The world watched in surprise as Prussia easily defeated Austria in the Austro Prussian War (1866), nearly annihilating the Austrian army at the Battle of Koniggratz. The new Prussian breech-loading rifle, the Dreyse Needle Gun, allowed the Prussian forces an overwhelming superiority in fire power over the slower muzzle-loading weapons of the Austrian army. In addition, Prussian &quot;swarm&quot; infantry tactics, which called for units advancing in supporting skirmish lines until they overlapped the enemy's flanks, confused the Austrians. Lastly, the Prussians had completely revised their tactics regarding the use of artillery, allowing batteries to be quickly moved and concentrated anywhere on the field of battle, pulverizing enemy forces. Military strategists all over the world analyzed the conflict and tried to adapt their doctrine to the new style of waging war introduced by the Prussians.The Franco-Prussian War forever changed the social, political and economic balance in Europe. The major European powers were stunned as the military might of France was devastated by a newly united Germany, and the seeds were sown for the constant political maneuvering and arms race that lasted until the start of the First World War.France was largely caught unprepared when war came in mid-July 1870, even though war with Prussia had nearly occurred every year since 1866. Prussian leaders, King Wilhelm Hohenzollern and the Statesman Otto von Bismark, were motivated by a desire for revenge against France stemming from the Napoleonic Wars, the possibility of regaining Alsace and Lorraine, formerly German territory, and providing a national motive for uniting Prussia and the independent German States. The French sought to &quot;keep Prussia in it's place&quot;, and maintain France's position as the leading power in Europe.The French defeat was owed as much to deficiencies on the part of the French themselves as it was to Prussian superiority. Emperor Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte III was corrupt, indecisive and unschooled in military matters. France's generals had a penchant for political infighting and bitter rivalry, created in large part by the Emperor's habit of passing over senior officers to promote his friends and supporters, subordinating the more experienced commanders to their juniors. France's generals also were indoctrinated to believe that their strengh lay in defense rather than attack, and French officers repeatedly passed up opportunities to attack and destroy smaller or weaker Prussian units, even when French forces were overwhelmingly superior.Organizationally, the French had a larger professional army than Prussia, as well as a system of reserves. The French army, however, proved to be poorly disciplined and the reserve system was wholly inadequate, as were mobilization plans, railways, etc. The Prussian army, though smaller, was better educated and trained, and backed up by a vast, quickly mobilized reserve. The one bright spot for France was their superb infantry rifle, the Chassepot. This powerful breech-loading rifle had double the effective range of the Prussian Dreyse, allowing the French troops to cut Prussian infantry to pieces before they closed. Unfortunately for the French, the Prussians more than offset this advantage with their overwhelming artillery, blasting French units to pieces under a rain of high explosive shells.Aside from the discussion of the actual fighting, Mr. Wawro treats all the facets of this brief but bloody struggle, from personal accounts of soldiers of both antagonists and the foreign observers and reporters of the conflict (which included US General Phillip Sheridan) to the Republican rebellion after the Prussian capture of Emperor Louis-Napoleon.For those interested in military or European history this book is a must have!"},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Wawro has written an excellent history of the Franco-Prussian War that details why the Prussians won and the French lost the conflict. According to Wawro the French had inferior tactics because they would mass their soldiers in defensive formations to take advantage of the superior French rifle over the dispersed German formations but these tactics made the French army unable to counter attack or take personal intiative in combat. The Prussians would take advantage of these French weaknesses by outflanking and eventually surrounding the immobile French formations despite the high causalties that the Prussian army took from the superior French rifles. The Germans also massed their artillery batteries to follow in close formation with the infantry and replied on time to any threats from the French riflemen. As a result the French were pounded mercilessly by the Prussian artillery and could not use their rifles or reply to Moltke's armies. Wawro also blames the inept performance by General Bazaine for the French defeat. Bazaine did not take advantage of the situation at Mars-la-Tour and failed to reinforce his vulnerable right wing at St Privat during the battle of Gravelotte. Wawro believes that Bazaine's greatest error was leaving his forces at Metz to be surrounded rather than marching east to German territory and threataning Prussian supply lines or marching north to relieve MacMahon's besieged forces at Sedan.I would strongly reccomend this book for anyone interested in a concise account of the Franco-Prussian War."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"In the Franco-Prussian War Geoffrey Wawro once again demonstrates a solid command of his subject, from researching minute details to crafting impressive theories with logical conclusions. This book is a follow up to his Austro-Prussian War and often uses that war as a backdrop for events a half a decade later.The book is an indictment of French generalship that in many ways should have either won the war or at least battled Moltke?s forces to a bloody stalemate. Prussia was not the military machine of perfect tactical execution myth would have us believe. In fact both France and Prussia committed blunders during battles, but Prussia owed much of its early success to the accuracy of its artillery. Bismarck and Moltke were willing to throw thousands of men to their deaths at the hand of the dreaded French Chassepot rifle, while French generals Bazaine and Bourbaki squandered every advantage through inactivity.In a course of five weeks, German forces had routed every French army leaving Paris open for conquest. But here is where France?s indecisiveness actually aided it. With Napoleon III out of the way, there was no legitimate French government to negotiate a peace. Prussia dispatched forces to the Loire Valley in attempts to defeat any French force in the field, which confounded Bismarck and strained the Prussian economy.In the end Bismarck forced France to accept a humiliating peace that festered in French politicians hearts and minds for four decades. Though this war represents the end of Bismarck?s use of conflict to realize his realpolitik, the impression on France had been made. One cannot really understand the First World War without first understanding the Franco-Prussian War.Wawro?s knowledge is incredibly detailed and his writing style is very readable, though casual ?history buffs? will probably not grasp the full comprehensiveness of this magnificent work.If the book has a fault, perhaps it is the lack of coverage of the Paris Commune and the revolution of post-Second Empire France. He gives this topic brief coverage, but the detail of which he described the road to war and the conflict itself is surprisingly missing."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Not only does Wawro do a very creditable job of covering the color and drama of the war, but he does a brilliant job of explaining the broader issues. I teach foreign relations and, in just a few pages, Wawro does a better job of explaining how Napoleon III and Bismarck upset the European balance of power than any specialist writer in the field. He also does a superb job of explaining the significance of the revolution in weaponry and tactics that would come to fruition (or doom) in WWI. All done in a very readable and accessible style."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Wawro's scholarship passes muster with the professional historian and (as important to the layman) his narrative enjoyably occupies the general reader. Wawro is a good writer.Both sides to the conflict of 1870-71 had their share of dunderheads in the field, but German planners had worked out their strategy well and well-in-advance. French planners hadn't. Though France knew by 1866 that a clash must come with a suddenly and dangerously expanded Prussia their ideas for the coming war were vague and only lazily vetted. In 1870 their expression might be conveyed as: \\"\\"Oh! we've gotten ourselves into a war. Now what do we do?\\" Even the logistics of getting men and supplies to the front was a lost battle all by itself.France's effort was further hobbled by, among others, a vainglorious, incompetent supreme commander Napoleon III and by that sick soul, the once-valuable General Bazaine. Though the French were gifted with the most rapid-firing gun of its age, the man-deconstructing Chassepot, technology was trumped by superior Prussian field tactics. Morally and emotionally distraught, the French threw away battles that could and should have been theirs.Wawro's earlier work \\"The Austro-Prussian War\\" shares the virtues of this later study . For readers interested in how and why the 1866 and 1870 conflicts happened and played out as they did, Wawro's accounts are rich with fascinating detail and insight that are the product of extensive and original research. Jim Smith"},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Wawro's book on the Franco-Prussian War is thoroughly researched and well-written. This book offers a detailed look at the causes of the war, the major political and military figures on both sides like Napoleon III and Otto von Bismarck, developments and improvements in military tactics and weaponry, and of course the major battles of the war between France and Prussia.The contrasts between the French and Prussian armies were stark. The French officers and soldiers were on average older, less disciplined and lacking in high morale. Many of the highest ranking French officers were poor leaders and many were plagued with a defeatist mentality even early on during the conflict. Marshal Bazaine was a good example of this. One of the few advantages the French had was their primary infantry rifle known as the Chassepot, which had a longer range of accuracy and could fire more rounds per minute than the Prussian rifle. However, Prussian artillery would be far superior to that of the French and would play a decisive role in many of the battles.The Prussians were indeed fortunate to have confronted such hesitant and generally poor French military commanders. Prussian victory was no sure thing at the beginning of the conflict, but they did seem to catch all the lucky breaks they needed to secure victory. This is not to say that the Prussians did not make mistakes. Several impetuous officers who launched several of the battles, including the battles at Spicheren and Gravelotte, paid a high price in terms of heavy casualties for their units as a result of their over zealousness to start a battle. Overall, however, they did seem to demonstrate better mastery of military tactics, including better use of reconnaisance and skirmish lines than their French counterparts. They used massed artillery at pivotal points on the battlefield with major effect and their infantry units could break down into smaller more mobile units to exploit any advantages on the battlefield.The end result was victory for the Prussians and a humiliating defeat for the French. The results of this war would lead to further political unease and instability in Europe that would only further the tensions leading up to World War I nearly fifty years later. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"Mr. Wawro's account of the Franco-Prussian War provides enough background information for anyone not familiar with the history surrounding the conflict to comfortably jump into it and follow along.

Well written."},{"Title":"FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR","review":"As an introduction to the Franco-Prussian War, I have little hope that I could have stumbled across a better writer to acclimate me to that history.After having just read Keegan's \\"The First World War\\", itself an excellent and thorough work (which, however, suffered from moving at a pace more compelled by the events than by the author), I wanted to read about one of the origins of conflict, being France's declaration of war on and eventual defeat by the blossoming Prussian Empire, 1870-71. I can say without the slightest hint of gratuity that Wawro's account of that contest is a vibrant literary work.Let me open by saying that more than just a tale of two armies, Wawro successfully captures the social and political perspectives of the two nations and weaves them seamlessly with the military aspect of the narrative in such a way...well, think of it in musical terms when three notes are used in creating a song, sometimes individually and sometimes as a chord but always within the perfect framework of the song, I guess, would be the way I would like to describe it.But more than that in making this a great read, and in fact the most compelling factor of all, is simply Wawro's abilities as an storyteller; rather than a dry discourse on an instance in history, I imagine that Wawro must be amongst the great historians for his ability to capture the wonder of the reader. The text has bounce, it finds an interia immediately and sustains it throughout, it is humorous and grave, and he gives it the daring and adventure one normally finds in fiction. He is also impeccable in his choice of quotes further lending to the spirit of the atmosphere he creates of the history.Marvelous reading!

There are few facts (budgets, technical specs, etc) but does tell names of participants of meetings and events.Each chapter covers some aspect of running the operation - getting reliable electricity, creating software to run the dish, etc. Things are not told strictly chronologically, as each topic is followed through time before picking up another topic in the next chapter. This could lead to a bit of confusion if you read this book in an on-and-off manner.

I don't know what genre he reads, but it is apparently not western. Elmer Kelton is one of the best western writers alive. This was a great example of his work.I used to play The Virginian on television for nine years with many great actors. I read the work of many writers, and there are very few as good as Kelton for realism and grit. The only man who can match him is Kirby Jonas, whose books I record on audio. They call Jonas the New Louis L'Amour. But as far as I'm concerned, and I've seen this written elsewhere by other reviewers, you don't need any other writers than Kelton and Jonas. Give the Buckskin Line a chance! You won't be sorry. Then try Death of an Eagle, by Kirby Jonas."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"If you want to know why the Western Writers of America have endowed Elmer Kelton with six Spur Awards and voted him greatest Western writer of all time, read THE BUCKSKIN LINE. The main character, Rusty Shannon, joins the Texas Rangers in a time before they were formally organized and glazed with glamour and prestige. Rusty's role with the Rangers takes a personal turn when he's forced to confront Buffalo Caller, the Comanche responsible for the slaying of his family during his boyhood. This encounter, along with the meeting of beautiful Geneva Monahan, casts the setting for another remarkable Kelton tale, character rich and full of Texas history. A must read, not just for fans of Western Literature, but for anyone who appreciates quality writing and a surefire adventure."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"It's been ages since I've read a Western. The genre doesn't seem to be very popular these days. The library shelves are filled with Zane Gray and Louis L'Amour, as if they were still alive and pumping out the books. I wish L'Amour were still around - he's one of my favorite writers, and I've yet to read another Western author who enchanted me the way L'Amour did.But I did find this little book at my local library, and decided to give it a try. I had seen other Kelton books but for whatever reason never checked them out. I should have - he's a fine writer.This book is quite good. The subtitle says it's a novel about the Texas rangers, but that's not entirely accurate. The protagonist, Rusty Shannon, is a member of the fledgling ranger patrol, but the rangers aren't central to the plot.The novel begins with a historic raid of a Texas coastal town by Comanches in 1840. A child with red hair is taken captive by a warrior, Buffalo Caller, but is rescued by Mike Shannon. Mike and his wife adopt the boy as his own. His Christian name is David, but everyone calls him Rusty because of his red hair.The book skips forward to 1859, and again to the early 1860s and the outbreak of the Civil War. Mike is murdered, and Rusty attempts to kill who he thinks is the killer, but Preacher Webb talks him out of it and convinces him to join the rangers on a remote outpost. Rusty meets up with a solid family with a babe daughter about his age (you know where that's going), but the family is solid Union, while the local bully is a Confederate determined to rid Texas of Yankee traitors. And there's still Comanches hanging around and causing trouble.I've greatly simplified the plot. This is not your typical shoot 'em up Western, though there is plenty of action. It's a thoughtful examination of duty and loyalty, of Rusty's struggles to do the right thing in a maelstrom of strong emotions and murky moral lines.This is a solid book, well-written and thoroughly researched. It's too early to claim Kelton as a worthy heir to L'Amour, but I'm going to read more of his books just the same."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"Elmer Kelton is great. That's all that really needs to be said. Every book he's ever written has been good, even though he'll humbly tell you the first ones weren't that good. He is far more believable than Louis L'Amour, who I grew up reading. His descriptive powers may not be quite as great, but he makes up for it. If you like Kelton and L'Amour, also check out Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'Amour. I think the time will come when he will be the name readers of the western seek out!"},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"Kelton writes historical fiction that is stripped down to character types and action. He's done his homework, and there's a history lesson under the plotline, but this story cuts quickly and cleanly from one crisis to the next. As a writer, Kelton fearlessly chases his hero up a tree and then throws rocks at him, almost to the last page.This first volume of his Texas Lone Star Trilogy introduces us to Rusty Shannon, a redheaded young man who joins the \\"buckskin line\\" of early Texas rangers during the time of the Civil War, when Comanches and whites still fought with much bloodshed for the right to inhabit the Texas frontier. There's also a world of animosity between secessionists and union loyalists, as young men march off either voluntarily or not to soldier for the Confederacy while others avoid conscription by fleeing westward onto the unsettled plains. The rangers, underpaid, poorly equipped and under-manned, operate chiefly as a ragged group of peacekeepers and law enforcers in the midst of all this turmoil.That's the history. Exciting enough as that is, the adventure of Rusty Shannon and the parallel story of the Comanche, Buffalo Caller, ramp up the urgency of any reader's interest in what happens next and keep the pages turning. Recommended for readers of fact-based Western fiction who also enjoy the celebration of heroism against all odds.For more history, finer character development, and greater emphasis on psychological realism, read Kelton's \\"The Day the Cowboys Quit,\\" which for my money is a worthy successor to Owen Wister's \\"The Virginian.\\""},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"First \\"western\\" I had read in years.

In 1861 Texas, pro-South and pro-North sentiments within the country were strong, resulting in violent confrontations. Mike Shannon is murdered by zealots for his Union supporting views and the family of the woman Rusty loves fairs no better when her father and brother are lynched by the Union-hating Caleb Dawkins. Rusty joins the Texas Rangers, an undermanned and seldom paid lot, fighting Indians in the frontier, which keeps him from picking sides in the Civil War. There is a showdown with the killer of his family, Buffalo Caller, and good tension throughout. The book deals with conflicting loyalties, moral dilemmas (helped along by the conscience of Preacher Webb), and the age-old question of duty."},{"Title":"The Buckskin Line","review":"If the author of this book is &quot;the greatest Western writer of all time&quot;, then it is time to leave the prairie.

Since cycles can extend, shorten, invert, and skip, Gann offers several trend-following methods to minimize damage from forecasting mistakes and to keep one on the right side of the markets. His excellent, 24 trading rules afford advice on money management, risk management, trend-following, trade entry, and exit techniques that are currently valid.Gann always openly hinted that the details for his celebrated forecasting method were concealed in his writings. This book, as is all others written by Gann, is written on two levels. The first level is expository and describes how to swing-trade. The arcana submerged in the second level can be approached by examining the recurrent themes about time, price, and geometry, and the dates which he feels are significant. Details for Gann's time and price model are contained in all of his books and major courses with the exception of \\"Tunnel Through the Air.\\"Strangely, the weakest part of this book is the final chapter with Gann's predictions for the early 1950s. Gann felt that 1953 was going to be a year of post-war depression rivalling the great depression of the 1930s. His cycle model indicated a strong down-turn which actually became a cyclical inversion where the market turned sharply upwards - such are the hazards of public forecasting! However, Gann followers should not have lost money during the 1953 inversion, because their swing-trade methods would have self-corrected this forecast error.Whatever level one chooses to tackle, this book is a worthwhile addition to anyone's trading library.Addendum, March 29, 2011, projected important stock market dates: 01/24/11; 03/18/11; 03/28/11; 04/25/11; 06/20/11; 07/07/11; 08/08/11; 09/06/11; 10/26/11; 11/21/11; 12/12/11; 01/17/12; 03/12/12; 04/09/12; 05/07/12; 06/11/12; 07/23/12; 08/20-23/12; 11/05/12; 11/26/12; 12/12/12; and 01/17/13."},{"Title":"Forty-Five Years in Wall Street","review":"Most famous for his 24 never-failing rules - basically follow the trend, use stop losses, and never average down.

The paper quality is also poor. Only the first chapter is interesting because of the rules (some advice) that you can read cheaply on one of the book reviews.Overall, boring, tedious, expensive and not very informative."},{"Title":"Forty-Five Years in Wall Street","review":"This book was written in 1949. By all means what put forth by Gann as the 12 and the 24 rules are still valid today. In fact, his ideas are still being copied in simply all other trading books. Even the diary like section in Soros' Alchemy of Fianance did resembled the style of a majority part of this book. In short, a must read for any trader!Remark: One might think that I am a crazy Gann friend. To justifiy the title I put for this review, I would like to summarize Gann's 12 and 24 rules for one's reference:-The 12 rules:-1. Determine the trend2. Buy at single, double and triple bottoms3. Buy and sell on percentages4. Buy and sell on 3 weeks' advance or decline5. Market moves in sections/waves6. Buy or sell on 5 to 7 point moves7. Study volume to determine change in trend8. Study time factor and time periods to determine change in trend. (p.s. when a time period on a decline exceeds that of a previous decline, it indicates a change in trend)9. Buy on higher tops and bottoms10. A change in trend often occurs just before or after holidays. (p.s. when prices are at high levels there are usually several swings up and down, then when the market breaks the low of the last swing it indicates a reversal and change in trend)11. Buy on a second reaction at a higher bottom. When it reacts only 2 days, it is in a very strong position.12. Price gains in fast moves does not last very long.The 24 rules:-1. Never risk one tenth of capital in one trade.2. Always use stop loss orders.3. Never overtrade.4. Never let a profit run into a loss.5. Do not buck the trend.6. When in doubt, get our or dont get in.7. Trade only active stocks.8. Equal distribution of risk in 4 or 5 stocks.9. Trade market order.10. Dont clsoe your trades without a good reason.11. Accumulate a surplus12. Never buy just to get a dividend.13. Never average a loss.14. Never get out/in of the market because of impatience or anxiety.15. Avoid taking small profits and big losses.16. Never cancel a stop loss order after you placed it.17. Avoid getting in and out of the market too often.18. Be just as willing to seel short as you are to buy. Let your object be to keep with the trend and make money.19. Never buy/sell just because the price is low/high.20. Wait till the stock is very active and has crossed resistance levels before pyramiding.21. Select stocks with small volume of shares outstanding to pyramid on the buying side.22. Never hedge one stock by another.23. Trade with a plan and do not get out without a definite indication of a change in trend.24. Avoid increasing trading size after a long period of success."},{"Title":"Casa de Hacienda: Architecture in the Colombian Countryside","review":"I'm familiar with some of these houses, but I gained new insight on the history and architectural characteristics of these country homes by readiing the text.

Oriel Malet,. something of a prodigy herself, wrote this astonishing little biography of Fleming in 1946 at age twenty. Although several biographies of Fleming had been written in the preceding century, and Malet's book owes much to Lytton Strachey's QUEEN VICTORIA (particularly in its descriptions of a child's ungovernable temperament), this novelized biography is a little miracle in its own right. Malet doesn't quite get down the way educated Regency Scottish children like Marjory spoke (the invented dialogue is often at odds with Marjory's own archly sophisticated observations in her diary), yet even still malet captured something not only about the involving struggle of a child straining to master language but the odd pitched battle in our souls from those to whom we feel we ought to owe our gravest debts and those whom we truly love the most."},{"Title":"Strength Down the Middle - The Story of the 1959 Chicago White Sox","review":"I grew up in South Texas in the 50's and 60's and related to the author's personal reflections throughout the entire book. I recall the White Sox and their pennant run while admitting to being a die hard Yankee fan not unlike most boys of those times without our own team to cheer for. I played many a sandlot game with my neighborhood buddies using the same broken and mended bats and decaying baseballs. I could recall my mother calling me in for dinner from our street playing fields as I read Larry's fond memories of the mongrel dog and his brother's game-winning home run. The baseball trading episodes left me wondering where my own boyhood treasures rest today. What a respite from my day ending pressures that I bring home from the office today. The day to day account of games also brought back memories of my early introduction to major league baseball by Dizzy Dean and Pee Wee Reece. I envy the author's fond recollection of sleep time radio broadcasts of his heros exploits; my experiences were relegated to Saturday afternoon television. The author nonrtheless took me back with him to where I thought I was in the room with him on those joyful radio celebrations. This book is a wonderful recall to days of joy and fun for boys and girls lucky to grow up in good family neighborhoods with caring parents and many friends.

I was in high school when the Pale Hose won their first flag in forty years so I am well aware of this time period and the players that were on each team's roster. The author concludes the book with a biographical summary of each player and mentions if they are now deceased. I guess I expected more.

Not having been born soon enough to experience the the ecstasy of a city in celebration of an AL Pennant, I feel like I lived that experience vicariously through this fine narrative.An enjoyable feature of Strength Down the Middle is the way the story segued from the exploits on the field to the showmanship of Bill Veeck to the childhood of the author to the major headlines of the season in the world of sports and beyond. Reading it in many ways, evokes the feelings of opening a time capsule 45 years after the 1959 season unfolded.I do not feel that this book is particularly well titled.

With roster changes and pitching performances his research of games provides the reader with throw back memories of the time. Names like Bill Tuttle, Rocky Colavito, Don Buddin and Jackie Jensen will jog your brain and take you back to a better time for the world, yourself and baseball. The book drags at times as he never alters from his game-to-game format. A little more local flavor of the stadium crowd and neighorhood following could have been substituted for his school stories. All-in-all it is a book I've been hoping to find for years since the Sox were a boyhood favorite that year.

Essentially every game that the White Sox played in 1959 is summarized in a paragraph or two with both highlights and lowlights. What's lacking is current interviews by the author with the men who played the game. The few quotes mentioned are easily obtainable from other printed sources.Another thing that I found somewhat annoying was the author's nostalgic trips into his own childhood. If I was interested in his little league activities and visits to Comiskey Park with his dad I wouldn't be looking for a book titled &quot;The Story of the 1959 White Sox&quot;.

Although Kalas does intersperse some personal stories and items of popular culture and general news from that time period, much of the book is a game-by-game recitation of facts and figures. As a fan and not a player or team outsider, Kalas doesn't have access to many inside stories of what went on in the player's minds either during or between the games. Thus, while SDM does provide the facts and figures for what happened on the field, it falls short of providing the full story of the 1959 White Sox season.As a current day White Sox fan, there are several aspects of the book that I found interesting. Kalas does provide some context around the White Sox and what they meant to the south side of Chicago in that era, especially to young boys playing sandlot baseball. There are notable parallels between the 1959 White Sox and the next White Sox team to make it to the World Series, the 2005 team: both teams had excellent defense and pitching, with several pitchers having career years; while both teams had excellent won/loss records, many of their wins came in tight games in which they had to grind out victories; both teams played very well on the road; and while the composition of both teams was in flux before, during and after the season, for that one special season, everything gelled on the field and the result was magic. It is interesting to see the differences in how pitchers are used in 1959 versus today, with the strong specialization (starter, middle reliever, 8th inning set-up man, closer) that has become standard. And although fans today may think of the pre-free-agent days as a time of much greater stability in team composition, there were far more roster moves and trades in that era than I was expecting, especially considering that there were only 7 other teams in the American League in 1959.Although Kalas did talk to several players and members of the 1959 White Sox organization, one can infer that his primary source of material was newspaper clippings about the games. So, Kalas saves the fan interested in the 1959 season from having to read 160 newspaper stories and box scores. The black-and-white photos in the middle of the book are excellent. One addition to the book that would make it more special is for it to include the CD contained in Lew Freedman and Billy Peirce's book \\"Then Ozzie Said To Harold\\", which contains the 1959 radio broadcast of the first World Series game versus the Dodgers.Bottom line: \\"Strength Down the Middle\\" is worth reading for White Sox fans interested in the 1959 season, but it doesn't tell the whole story."},{"Title":"Strength Down the Middle - The Story of the 1959 Chicago White Sox","review":"This book provides a day-by-day chronology of the 1959 Chicago White Sox - that team's first pennant winner in 40 years. Author Larry Kalas provides a summary of every Sox game that year, when the Sox took the pennant by five games over Cleveland (New York was 15 back). Chicago's solid pitching (Early Wynn, Bob Shaw, Billy Pierce) and stellar glove work (Luis Aparicio, Jim Landis, Nellie Fox, Sherm Lollar, Jim Rivera) overcame a weak-hitting lineup that clubbed just 97 home runs - fewest in baseball that year. True, Chicago lost the 1959 World Series to LA, but it was the most fun their fans had in 40 years. And Chicago fans then waited another 46 years for the next pennant, when the 2005 White Sox finally won it all. No wonder this working class team from the City's less glamorous South Side has never been considered trendy or media favorites.Unfortunately, Kalas provides too little in the way of analysis and player portraits. He should have interviewed key figures, including manager Al Lopez (1908-2005) who was still around when this book came out in 1999. Despite these flaws, fans that remember 1959 should enjoy memories from this book."},{"Title":"Strength Down the Middle - The Story of the 1959 Chicago White Sox","review":"This was a joy to read. My father had told me stories about the '59 White Sox and Mr. Kalas did a wonderful job of recreating the season. It helped me feel a little more connected with my dad.

It is my favorite book because when you read a romance you usually expect as follows: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl falls in love with boy, they live happily ever after or die. Zane Grey throws an unusual twist into the usual romance storyline. The &quot;boy&quot;, Pecos Smith, thinks the &quot;girl&quot;, Terril Lambeth, is a boy. Pecos thinks of Terril as a little brother, where as; Terril thinks of Pecos as handsome man. Zane Grey captures a strange yet amazingly tender romance that could only happen West of the Pecos."},{"Title":"West of the Pecos","review":"Zane Grey was a \\"formula\\" writer, and he was the one who created the \\"formula\\", the modern western novel. And he used the same plot devices in many of his books. This one uses the girl pretending to be a boy scheme to protect the innocent young girl from being treated harshly by the other drovers. Terrill Lambeth is now an orphan, her father having died, and her adventures are the basis of this story. The fact she can ride and shoot doesn't hurt, but before long, Pecos Smith, the hard riding, fast shooting \\"man\\" of the bunch discovers he is a she. And you can probably already imagine the scenarios that follow. This is a \\"traditional\\" western, the kind one associates with Zane Grey; it has the broad use of language and the vivid descriptions of the locale he is known for. It is a book well worth reading, and more than once."},{"Title":"Rhode Island: An Explorer's Guide (Explorer's Guide Rhode Island)","review":"This guidebook is divided into eight sections by geographic region, with a top-level map up front and detailed maps of each location by section. The entire book is black and white, but the maps and pictures are still crystal clear. The opening chapter is an index referencing any subject one could want to find in Rhode Island, from ballooning to antiques to quahogs to yachting. I was most impressed with the \\"Green Spaces\\" section for each region, listing dozens of outdoor parks and activities available in the Ocean State. While there are certainly other more detailed outdoor guidebooks to Rhode Island, they haven't been updated recently, and this is a great overview guide to the riches of \\"green space\\" available in Little Rhody. Also included are beaches with recommendations about what outdoor activities are appropriate at each. Plus, if you want to visit historic houses, historic churches, historic mansions, or general historic sites, this is the state and the guidebook for you.For Activities, price information is noticeably missing. Perhaps detailed prices date a guidebook too much, but as a traveler, I'd like to get an idea whether this boat excursion or that historic house is within my general budget. Restaurants, on the other hand, are broken into price categories, and include terse yet informative descriptive information about the cuisine, location, and atmosphere. As a native, I'm well aware that hotels in Rhode Island are just plain more expensive than they are in other parts of the country. If you want to sleep in luxury, you can find some great direction from this guide. For a deal, I'd recommend utilizing Internet search engines. The low single-dollar-sign category in this book refers to hotels under a \\"mere\\" $95 (as of 2000).There is something to be said for compact guidebooks, and this is not one. It is a generously oversized paperback with thick pages and both large fonts and margins. This isn't a book to tuck into your extra backpack pocket when trekking around. Then again, all that extra text left the authors room to inform me that Goddard Park was man-made by two generations of owners and is cited as one of the best man-made forestry projects of all time.

The book is very well written.With characters like Bonnard, it is not too complicated to understand why Anatole France was the 1921 Nobel laureate."},{"Title":"Barinelli's War","review":"Author Eugene B. Basilici has taken a huge step forward in honoring those who fought in the Korean War with his novel \\"Barinelli's War\\". This story is riveting and honors those brave young men who fought there. The author claims to have loosely based his story on the actions of the real life heroes of Fox Company who held the Toktong Pas open while engaged against a full Chinese Division. The actions of that small group saved the lives of some 25,000 allied troops. So his story has a feel of realism to it. \\"The Forgotten War\\" is no longer to be forgotten because of authors like him.In Basilici's book his main character is a young man just fresh from basic training named Rick Barinelli. The reader gets to follow him as he matures and endures tests of his courage. He eventually gets promoted and when his company captain disappears he is left with the command responsibility of protecting 25,000 troops with just his own small force of men against the onslaught of hordes of Chinese soldiers. Greatly out numbered he shows what he is made out as he leads his men in victory against all odds!Lots of action and battles but the real story is how the author lets the reader get know each of the stories main characters. There is depth and emotion to the telling of this tale and the author makes you wonder if he was thee himself. It comes off as if it were really a memoir of some someone who had been there and saw it. His words drip in blood, courage and heroism! It is a flag waving red, white and blue tribute without the band, the parade or the flag! It is a tribute to those who did fight there even if it had to be told though a fictional story. It is told with dignity and clarity of purpose. You know who the heroes are and root for themThis book receives the MWSA's highest rating of FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"Barinelli's War","review":"\\"Barinelli's War\\" puts the reader smack into the bitter-cold that was the Chosin Reservoir Breakout.

(Life Is a Road Series)","review":"As a rider who enjoys reading about riding, I found Daniel Meyer's first book to capture something essential about the need to ride a motorcycle. Even his tales of driving from one Denny's to the next, in search of hot fudge sundaes, were humorous in a quiet, warm, and homey way, and so I eagerly picked up this second book hoping for something of the same experience. I was disappointed. While some of the stories in the first book strained credulity, they still brought a smile to my face. Too many in this collection strayed so far from the believable that they made my eyes roll instead. The author can be forgiven for his quasi-mystical take on life and riding. There is certainly a tradition for this in motorcycle books. But harder to take is Mr. Meyer's need (more in this book) to tell tall tales which unabashedly position him as couragous, heroic, and the object of feminine desire. Rather than capturing the sweetness and \\"magic\\" that is often so much a part of ordinary motorcyle riding and the people in it, these stories seem to reflect another kind of ordinariness-- the tendency of some authors to devolve into writing that is theatrical, pseudo-philosophical, and blantantly self-aggrandizing. If Mr. Meyer writes another book I will buy it,(I like motorcycle books) but I will hope for more warmth and less narcissism."},{"Title":"Life is a Road, Get on it and Ride!

His style borders on Indiana Jones meets ghandi, a good mix, with a flare toward the dramatic (the magic) an inspirational combination that lights a fire in his reader to follow their dreams rather than fall into complacency.

The book is short so that shouldn't damper any efforts to read. The book, as the title suggests, is about a place where the many characters in the book get together and tell each other their stories. The castle itself is the place where these destinies cross, in the form of stories told by each character via tarot deck. The means of intersection between each story is allegoric to events in everyday life, each card having multiple meanings to different characters and stories.The stories themselves are at turns interesting and complicated, sometimes dull and obscure.The Castle of Crossed Destinies is a book that has many strengths and even more layers to it, and would make for strong rereading material (hopefully getting better then), but be forewarned that one should be ready to interpret a grapeshot of heavily themed stories, virtually without rest. Do not read when tired."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"Students of the tarot can hardly put time to better use than to study this little book. It is entertaining; it is often profound and startling; but most usefully it details a novel method of reading the tarots which the reader can practice.The stories are based on two decks, treated separately: the ancient Visconti deck and the also-old Tarot of Marseille. Illustrations line most pages, both in color and as page edgings illustrating his stories. Calvino does not, as a true Italian, try to replace the missing Devil and Tower from the older Florentine deck with the unsatisfactory modern replacements, but simply omits their illustrations. Any deck can be used with his method, and in fact the author toyed with the idea of making a third story-telling deck from modern comic strips.Italo Calvino is a writer of \\"magical realism,\\" and this is the technique he uses: the magical elements are simply taken for granted. He mixes his own tarot stories with graceful pastiches stirred together from many classics, and often says quite interesting things about these classics. You can lay out the cards and make stories, too; this is a good book to fit with the modern interest in tarots."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"The Castle of Crossed destinies uses tarot cards as a medium of communication to imaginatively narrate several stories. While I enjoyed the book and the idea, Calvino's description of how he was inspired to write in this way makes it seem that he merely came up with a neat idea and quickly executed it - without much deliberation. I wanted to feel that the book was more than the result of an intellegent, charming writer's Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"In a fairy-tale setting--a castle and a tavern in the heart of a dense wood--a company of men and women are brought together by chance.

Knowledge of the Canterbury Tales is helpful, but Calvino makes sure it sits in the background and does not dominate his readings. I use &quot;readings&quot;, if you must know, because this is the strucutre of the novel-a series of tarot card readings of a group of travelers who stop in this castle. The stories are wonderful, in the proud Italian tradition of Boccacio, Petrarch, and Chauser(who learned all he could fropm his Italian masters), and his modern master Borges, and the framing device, is interesting and used subtly and skillfully. If you don't have questions about the nature of narratives and fictions, and about the way those answers implicate how a human subject understands reality or comes to it, &quot;Castle&quot; may not be for you, as you may get bogged down in it's introverted labyrinthine reflections. If Borges' metaphysical fariy tales are your cup of tea, it here runneth over."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"Italo Calvino's an author I've enjoyed for years, devouring his strange narratives. Reading The Castle of Crossed Destinies for the first time I feel like someone's torn the carpet from under my feet: I'm disappointed. Yes, it's &quot;ingenious&quot;, as a back cover excerpt from a New Yorker review states, but it's not gripping or enthralling or a good read. The genius of this book lies in its structure, in the way it's been created. This is a book of stories interpreted or laid over patterns found in tarot cards placed on a table in criss-crossing patterns. Stories read horisontally and vertically like words in crossword puzzle.As concept art or an experiment in narrativity this is ingenious. I love it. But it's not just concept art. (Ah, and I realise that &quot;just&quot; is dodgy. I'm not quite sure where it might lead.) This is a book. Books are meant to be read. This ingenious structure results in dull, uninspired stories. I'm exhausted after two: I've seen the structure (concept, gimmick) and I'm sated.The concept is cool but then what? Is a gimmick enough? I suppose that depends on what you want. I mostly want more."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"Italo Calvino was a master of surreal storytelling -- he was, for example, one of only two authors I've seen who could manage a second-person narrative. But his gimmick falls flat in \\"The Castle of Crossed Destinies,\\" a book that is intriguingly laid out, but never manages to be more than a curiosity.In the first section, a traveler comes to a castle full of other guests, but for some reason no one there is able to speak. To tell each other about their histories, they use a pack of tarot cards to communicate their stories -- tales about love affairs, ancient cities, and Faustian pacts.The second is pretty much the same, except that it takes place in a tavern, where mute people are still using tarot cards to describe their pasts. The stories -- evil queens, fallen warriors, even an Arthurian tale -- get darker and stranger, especially when the narrator himself began to describe his own past to the people who are watching him and the cards.As an idea, tarot cards being used to tell a story is brilliant. Especially since the stories that Calvino spins out are not necessarily the only interpretation -- each card used to tell the story can be interpreted differently. The problem is, in the first half of the book, Calvino tries to apply this to some very boring, straightforward little stories. They tend to stop suddenly, without much of a finale.The second half of the book uses this gimmick more skilfully, with Calvino writing in greater detail, and using more ornate, atmospheric writing. It feels less like stories wrapped around some cards, and more like stories with cards as illustrations of what might have been. He also adds a more eerie, macabre tale to this half, making it even more engaging.The first half sags in a big way; it's almost tiring to read. But the second half of \\"Castle of Crossed Destinies\\" is where Calvino's tarot gimmick starts to pay off. Interesting, but not all that it could have been."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"Just as the tarot card reading unfolds in the story, this book has innumerable levels that beg for thought and interpretation: it is part historical novel, part fortune-telling, and part a history of the great classics of western civilization. It is also a fascinating experiment in expanding the literary vehicle, adding the dimension of the cards - functioning as kind of symbolic building blocks as well as a springboard for association - that creates a parallel narrative to the gorgeous descriptive power of the work. Calvino, I feel, has created a work as complex and rich as the best of Nabokov. As with all truly great novels, there is a great deal left unsaid, that the reader can mull over if she so chooses. While the vocabulary was very difficult for my primitive Italian, it was as beautifully written as Calvino's other work.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"Calvino is one of the most creative writers I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The concept alone of this book is jaw-dropping in its possibilities--a group of strangers come together and tell their adventures through tarot cards. Each tarot combination is illustrated and interpreted by the narrator with ties to several mythological tales. It is all extremely subjective and extremely ambitious.All of that aside, the concept proved to be more than Calvino could adeptly handle. (He admitted to never being completely satisfied with the book and finally published it as a way to put it to rest) However, I don't think I've ever read another author who could have handled the subject matter better than Calvino. All in all, I would only recommend this to Calvino's most devoted admirers."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"One of the above mentioned reviewers thought the execution to be vague in its style and not the work of indepth thought, perhaps though it takes a certain degree of ingenious to see such possibilities from a pack of tarot cards, to me it sounded like he spent some time figuring out how to best execute it from the after note and in particular its final comment on how he wishes each time he sits down to write a book to be writing as if for the first time sums up Calvino as a writer, his approaches are constantly varied and always breath-takingly original. As I have found European writers in particular are able to take novels to another level of experience, manipulate the form to create something original and classic. The novel reads like a classic and seems timeless in its setting and execution and follows a Canterbury Tales theme, there are occasionally hints here and there that it is a modern writer, in one tale the mention of technology like computers seemed out of place and alerts you to the fact that is recent. To best read this you need plenty of time to enjoy it, the steam of conscious style demands your attention as do the tales, some original, some based on classical legends. A well worthwhile read"},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"I really can not say that I enjoyed The Castle of Crossed Destinies but the structure of the narrative is very interesting and is in some ways a commentary on all narration and also on the underlying archetypes of narration. Thus for readers of fiction, this short book, a collection of stories, offers food for thought about how a story is created or re-created as the case may be. The book is written in two sections. In both, a traveler comes to a castle or tavern where no one can speak and each person at the table tells their story or tale using the Tarot cards. There are many stories related here but the curiosity is that one person's series of cards can then be criss-crossed with another traveler's cards to form a grid which can be read backward and forward, up and down. Thus the elements of the narrative can be used and reused in creating narration in an infinite number of patterns with the cards having different meanings depending on the sequence in which they are read. This strongly hints at the psychology of Carl Jung and the universal archetypes that play a role in each person's psychological makeup. However a story requires that the actors show action and thus the series of cards in and of themselves do not relate very much action, which must be interpreted by the mute teller to the listeners. The randomness of this is certainly a protection against clich&eacute; but some of the stories generated with this methodology left me a bit unsatisfied. There are many magical characters and yet the stories, for all their strangeness, seemed to end up abruptly. Throughout the book are illustrations of the cards mentioned on that particular page, a nice touch. Also at then end of the book is a diagram mapping Calvino's interpretation of Shakespeare's great tragedies. In summary, this book appears to be an experiment with narration which is very interesting as a concept but the stories left me a bit cold."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"I'm a beginner at reading Italian literature, but there's a few amusing things Calvino did here...he took pivotal scenes from classic literature that includes the poetic epic Orlando in Love and characters of Shakesphere, works of Renaissance literature, and rematched them to the minature art of the time, tarocchi game cards.I recognize excerpts of human passions from the poetry epic of Orlando in Love from Matteo Maria Boiardo, the Ferarra count, poet and storyteller for the D'Estes clan in the 1470s in the Castle of Crossed Destinies. Calvino also took parts of the Arthurian romantic tales that Boiardo, Aristo and other courtly poets and 'rematched' them to the trump and other cards of the classic Italian tarocchi. I say rematched, as Boiardo and other poets/artists of D'Estes family members did allegorical praising in their poems or paintings that included direct or thinly disguised praises to their patrons. The patrons appear as romantic heroes amid Greco-Roman, Arthurian or other mythic landscapes. The D'Estes and Visconti-Sforzas were related through marriages and both sets of families have historical tarocchi card sets---but it is the \\"completed\\" set from the Milanese Visconti-Sforzas that we are familiar with now.I thought that I recognized a few of the fictional scenes that Calvino presented from Renaissance sources."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"It's sort of like the Canterbury tales or Decameron with Tarot cards. A bunch of people try and communicate their stories by assembling the cards into different configurations, and while Calvino's discussion about the construction and inherent multiplicity in any story are interesting, the stories themselves just don't have that uber-precise spark that so much of his other writing contains. And even the theoretical tone he takes when trying to explain the different meanings and cross currents is nowhere near as engaging as when he just examines the idea directly in his non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Castle of Crossed Destinies","review":"This is kind of a splendid book. It is demanding; the reader must engage with it, examining each card as it is revealed and disputing its meaning with the narrator. It also helps to be well-versed in folklore and literature, both because recognizing many of the tales makes them more comprehensible and because Calvino's style is a strange, almost challenging mix of archaic and modern literary styles that sits uneasily on genre shelves.It actually reminds me quite a bit of Catherynne M. Valente's two-volume novel The Orphan's Tales (The Orphan's Tales: In the Night Garden&The Orphan's Tales: In the Cities of Coin and Spice); enough, in fact, that I wonder if she was inspired by this work. Neither novel is quite a novel, per se, but more a collection of folk tales (or short stories in the form of folk tales) wound around each other through a magical framing device; but while many readers would probably enjoy the books more by reading them that way, they ARE more than the sum of their parts. Both site themselves within and comment on the greater body of world mythology; in both the narrator is just as much a character to figure out as any of the people he/she is discussing, and it is the narrator's story that is the heart of the book.Calvino's book is not perfect; the first section, in the castle, is quite a bit more polished and satisfying as a puzzle than the second half in the tavern. The stories in the first half fit together organically, each leading into the next one and fitting together with all the others that came before in the crossword puzzle effect mentioned in the description; in the second half Calvino could not bring order to the chaos of cards, and while he made that chaos part of the novel's structure it still failed to satisfy. But despite (or possibly because of) its failings it is splendid. Glorious even. Pure, inventive literary fun."},{"Title":"Sew and Go: Easy Convertible Projects for the Active Life-Style (Creative Machine Arts)","review":"I really enjoy the projects in this book.

The sheets are more durable that some of the fabrics too because they are made that way. I encourage every sewer to buy and use this book. Use your imagination throughout too.

Drawing heavily from both Canadian and American magazine articles, Robertson gives us a revealing look at this eccentric vocalist.Speaking as a first-person witness to lang's early career, Robertson escorts us through the landscape that has shaped her direction thus far. Robertson touches on the events and people that have had a defining influence on lang's life, from her roots in Consort, Alberta through her training at Red Deer College, and her arrival on country music's doorstep. He briefly explores the mindset of traditional country music and relates lang's struggle for recognition within that framework, as well as her successful segue to the broader palatte of adult pop music.As a very new fan who knew little of k.d. lang, I enjoyed this account of a unique woman whose single-minded tenacity has vindicated her undeniable talent.

This makes it easy to read the footnotes. Overall; this isn't the best formatted Kindle book, but it is acceptable as a freebie.I found the book itself to be quite interesting. It is a series of 20 lectures given by James at Edinburg University on the subject of Religious Experiences. James is purposely staying away from formal religious belief and focusing on personal experiences. He approaches the subject from the point of view of a psychologist.He reviews several case studies of profound religious experiences of many people from famous \`saints' to normal everyday people. He finds several things in common that he discusses. He was applying scientific methods to the study of these experiences.This was a prelude to his book on \`Pragmatism', which was highly influential in the 20th century on philosophy and religion.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology and religion.

He was also deeply read in philosophy and science, and expressed himself with clarity and humor.The book is composed of a series of talks James gave as Gifford Lecturer on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh, and covers the key experiences and attitudes that we tend to call \\"religious\\": the sense of the \\"reality of the unseen\\", for example, and the feelings of sin and beatitude, as well as conversion, saintliness, mysticism, and the relationship of philosophy to religion.James treats all these phenomena with interest and respect. His attitude is scientific and impartial, and from these lectures it is not possible to tell where his own spiritual convictions lie.In all, James demonstrates with a wide range of striking examples and case studies the breadth, depth, and power of the human experience of religion in its widest sense, and shows why scientific and philosophical critiques of \\"religion\\" invariably miss their target and never succeed. The experience of religious feeling is a distinct and powerful class of human emotions, and efforts to rationalize this away are never convincing, certainly not to those who have experienced the emotions. Rudolf Otto, in his landmark book \\"The Idea of the Holy\\", even as he patronizes James as a \\"rationalist\\" and a \\"pragmatist\\", nonetheless leans on him for support in his own argument that the experience of the sacred is a unique and all-important aspect of human life.This is one of the best books on religion or spirituality ever written, and it is all the better for not being written by a cleric, mystic, practitioner, or other apologist for any branded faith.

The style is accessible and engaging, consistently interesting with well-reasoned arguments. Religions are not compared; the study is restricted to the experiences of the individual. It has nothing to do with churches, doctrine or dogma, concerning itself only with the religious experiences of everyday life.James considers the feelings, actions and experiences of people insofar as they understand themselves to be in a relationship with whatever they consider the Divine. He emphasizes the passionate aspect of religion and its power of adding enchantment to life. Dealing objectively with a wide spectrum of observed and personally related religious experiences, James also quotes from the autobiographical writings of famous authors, theologians and mystics from many traditions including Whitman, Luther, Voltaire, Emerson, Tolstoy and many others.The terrain of study is clearly identified and circumscribed. Chapter titles include Religion & Neurology, the Reality of the Unseen, the Religion of Healthy-Mindedness, the Sick Soul, the Divided Self & the Process of Unification, Conversion, Saintliness, Mysticism and Philosophy. This book offers a treasure trove of insights, revelation, wisdom and points to ponder that contributes substantially to the reader's understanding of consciousness, psychological processes, mystic states, thought & emotion, and the relationship to the Eternal Divine.In his own words: \\"Both thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct may be determined either by feeling or thought. When we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have prevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian and Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories which religion generates, being thus variable, are secondary. If you wish to grasp its essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct as being the more constant elements.\\"Although it is not a difficult text to grasp, patience is called for since every sentence is loaded with so many layers of meaning that one often has to reread a previous paragraph in order to fully comprehend and properly process the insights and information. A mindful, meditative study of the text will richly reward the reader.Chapter 14 ofCracking the Bible Codeby Jeffrey Satinover contains interesting information on William James and his views on freedom of choice within deterministic influences. Other works on religion and/or spirituality that I have found illuminating, inspiring or thought-provoking areBible Mystery and Bible Meaning&The Creative Process in the Individualby Thomas Troward,Religion in the Makingby Alfred North Whitehead,The Hidden Power of the Bibleby Ernest Holmes,Alter Your Lifeby Emmet Fox,The Thirteen Petalled Roseby Adin Steinsaltz andOne Cosmos Under Godby Robert Godwin."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"Contrary to many authors who either deride the beliefs of othersor promote their own beliefs, W.

James judges notwhat he sees, but tries to understand and explain from thestandpoint of psychology to which type of subjective phenomenoneach experience can be seen to belong, without partiality in hisclassification. So the interest of such a book is to give thereader an opportunity to undo some of his personal beliefs aboutreligion, as we too often hear that \\"religion transcends the realmof usual experience\\" so that nobody would be allowed to sayanything about it. W.

First, you have to get through the academic writing style of the late 19th century: paragraph-length sentences with triply nested clauses and extensive quotes from other, equally opaque writers. You'll eventually get used to this style, but it will never flow easily.Next, you have to contend with James' model of psychology, which is different in many ways from our own. He wrote this book when the notion of the subconscious was a bleeding edge concept, Pavlov had yet to identify learned behavior, and experimental psychology was just starting up. So, although his psychology is sound, you'll have to mentally translate it into the more modern models.But, if you can get through these barriers, it is a seminal book. James finds it natural to unite the notions of personal psychology and religious revelation without conflict (or at least not much conflict), while honoring both traditions."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"William James writes in a refined, almost Elizabethean style, which is very effective in isolating and postulating the cases of religious and mystical experiences outlined here. Besides James' objective approach to the study, I also appreciate the range of cases studied. From the greatest of Christian mystics to the strangest of self-mortificationists, the characters, experiences and events James squeezes out of history provide an informative, astounding, and entertaining look at the world of religious experiences (often referred to as 'mystical experiences'). And perhaps most importantly, he does this without pandering to his readership nor pushing his beliefs onto others. Ultimately, as a psychologist, he seems far more concerned with objectively studying the cases of individual's experiences, rather than using his findings to proselytize in any way, shape or form. Recommended for those new to the study of 'non-ordinary' religious experiences, mystical phenomenon, and perhaps psychology. But this is no joke or quack fad. It is a study based on hard research. William James was a highly respected professional in circles of literati, psychology, and scholasticism."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"William James's classic \\"The Variety of Religious Experience\\" (1902) consists of the text of the twenty lectures he delivered as the Gifford Lecurer at the University of Edinburgh in 1901 -- 1902. James took has his theme the exploration of \\"religious feelings and religious impulses.\\"In great detail, he studies how people who have had deep and, to them, convincing religious experiences describe these experiences and the meaning the experiences have for their lives. The book is, in fact, a wonderful mixture of psychology, description, and philosophy. The book is beautifully written, if dense, and needs to be pondered.James is best-known as a pragmatist, but I found it helpful to approach the Varieties through phenomenology and personalism. Phenomenology was developed by the German philosopher, Edmund Husserl, a great admirer of James and his near-contemporary. It encouraged philosophers to develop understanding by looking to the things themselves rather than be seeing them in terms of rigid and imposed concepts. The Varieties takes a phenomenological approach in that it is in large part devoted to looking at religious activities, such as conversions, mysticism, saintly behavior, prayer, and seeing what they are and what they do without making commitments regarding the causes of the behavior. Thus, James rejects both reductionism (explaining religion in psychological terms as an allegedly aberrant behavior) and theological interpretations to concentrate on exploring the phenomena themselves.James's book is also highly individualistic. In his second lecture he limits the scope of his inquiry by defining its object as \\"the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine\\". Several things should be noted about the task James sets himself. James has little to say about communal forms of religion -- the churches, synagogues, mosques, and other institutions in which many believers practice. Indeed James is frequently criticised for skewing the range of religious activity that needs to be addressed in understanding religion. James's inquiry is also highly personal. It focuses on the response of individual men and women in their private and intimate feelings. In his concluding lecture, James writes: \\"so long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with the symbols of reality, but as soon as we deal with private and personal phenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completes sense of the term.\\" Shortly thereafter, he says \\"By being religious we establish ourselves in possession of ultimate reality at the only points at which reality is given us to guard. Our responsible concern is with our private destiny, after all.\\"With its focus on individual belief, James's book is pluralistic and shows an openness, which I find refreshing and modern, to many practices and creeds. James's approach has room for the traditional believer as well as for people, such as James himself, who have difficulty attaching themselves to a particular creed but who have a felt need for a spiritual life. Many people struggle and continue to struggle over this issue -- spirituality without an institution -- and they will feel comfortable with James. For myself, I found James's brief mentions of Buddhism, for one example, highly insightful. Although James disclaims knowledge of Buddhism he offers important comments on it in discussing meditation, pessimism, God (he acknowledges Buddhism as an athiestic religion) and karma. There are, however, many momemnts in this book when James's Protestant background and probably biases come through -- he sometimes is condescending to Catholic experience, and there is little treatment of Judaism in the Varieties.The earlier chapters of the Varieties are philosophical in tone as James labors to define, explain and defend the nature of his inquiry. In the concluding chapters, James considers again philosophical and rationalistic approaches to religion and offers the briefest sketch of his own philosophy of religious and theological pluralism. The body of the book consists of long discussions of personal religious experiences from a variety of individuals and eras. James does bring a great deal of psychology to bear upon the descriptions, particularly when discussing the unconscious and in analyzing the different types of conversion experiences. The Varieties is best known for the distinction it draws between healthy-minded religion and the sick soul. The former James describes as \\"once-born\\" people who tend to see the universe as good throughout and in no need of redemption. (James gives an excellent discussion of Walt Whitman as a \\"once-born\\" type of religious believer.) The \\"sick soul\\" or twice-born person sees the need of understanding suffering and abandoning delusive behavior as necessary to spiritual redemption. James himself went through difficult and agonizing personal and religious experiences, but he finds value in both approaches and in their many variants. He truly offered a pluralistic approach to religion.The Varieties wears its age remarkably well. The book does not aim to convert its readers. But it has a great deal to say of interest to both religiously inclined and secular people about the nature of the religious life. More importantly, I think the Varieties may help readers understand themselves and find their own paths to a rewarding life.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"I just re-read James's Varieties, and again I am impressed at his even-handed treatment of a notoriously difficult subject. True, the book is long, and not couched in the short sentences and simple language of the popular press. But I am glad to see from the many positive reviews here that there are still many people who can appreciate a book that requires time, attention, and good reading skills.It is true that the examples are primarily Christian, and that we are now exposed to a much broader range of religious world-views. Perhaps because I was exposed to serious Christianity as a child, I was able to translate the spirit of many of the examples of Christian experience into my preferred religious language (Buddhist). The extremely emotional examples of religious experience cited are antithetical to Buddhist thought, and many strayed into idolatry, in my understanding. (There are popular Buddhist traditions, too, that seem idolatrous to the more abstract-minded.) But I still found those cases very informative, considering the current resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the U.S. It gave me some insight into what might be missing from current liberal Christian theological formulations, that is causing their decline in acceptance by the general population. On the whole, a brilliant treatment of the subject, within the necessary limits the author set for himself."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"It's often said - sometimes quite colorfully - that everyone has an opinion. Against that backdrop, William James' classic book on religion stands out as a model for letting the facts speak for themselves.James analyzes the life of religion (more than &quot;the religious life&quot;) from numerous perspectives. Yet his description of the born-again, or conversion experience is perhaps the most compelling.Instead of merely editorializing, he presents the descriptions of born-again experiences in the language of the people who had them. The reader is then free to distill from those descriptions the elements that comprise the experience, and distinguish those from the many interpretations given to them. James' book is not a polemic for or against religious conversion, but more accurately a description of the experience and a guide for its (many) interpretations.This is not to suggest that the book begins and ends with the matter-of-fact dryness of Sgt. Joe (&quot;Just the facts, ma'am.&quot;) Friday. On the contrary, James cared passionately about his work. This topic mattered greatly to him, and in his remarks on it he displayed a clear preference for levelheadedness and reason. He was no supernaturalist. Yet by presenting the data without judging it, he gives us a framework to continue move religious thought forward, beyond the narrow confines of pat dogmas."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This review refers to the \\"edition\\" published by Pacific Publishing Studio.Customers should stay away from this absolutely atrocious edition. The print is microscopic and crowds the margins, and the footnotes have actually been run into the text instead of being set off at the bottom of the page or the end of the chapters. Incredibly annoying. Frankly, I've never seen anything like it, and no outfit that puts out a text of such amazingly low quality deserves to be called a professional publishing house. I returned my copy to Amazon within hours of delivery."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"Here is William James' extraordinarily dispassionate and narrowly empirical and pragmatic examination of a topic that has rarely been treated dispassionately. The reading can be difficult, actually tedious, but James' language is persistently non-colonized (he had little respect for the popular psychobabble buzzwords and delusionally simplistic conclusions of his day [and one expects that this would hold true a century later!]). By standards of 'originality'* (a word that must be qualified) and reputation, he probably remains America's most famed philosopher of mind (which is something of an affliction to his dogmatic detractors). It seems that he was/is America's most famed psychologist/neurologist as well.*(James says of his investigation, \\"Originality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all the attitudes and tempers that are possible have been exhibited in literature long ago, and where any new writer can immediately be classed under a familiar head.\\" Yet, while no single consideration in this work is strictly 'original', the work in sum remains highly unique.)A large sampling of varied religious experience and psychological temperament is scrutinized. Many readers will find the sampling too large (this reader did). As is quickly apparent, a large number of cited experiences are 'extreme' -- we might say nutty. One might think the material is becoming a mocking of religious experience per se, but James warns us not to leap to conveniently simplistic conclusions: \\". . . it always leads to a better understanding of a thing's significance to consider its exaggerations and perversions, its equivalents and substitutes and nearest relatives elsewhere. Not that we may thereby swamp the thing in the wholesale condemnation which we pass on its inferior congeners, but rather that we may by contrast ascertain the more precisely in what its merits consist, by learning at the same time to what particular dangers of corruption it may also be exposed.\\" James finds what might be called the \\"religious temperament\\" to embrace a broad range of opinions:\\"'He believes in No-God, and he worships him,' said a colleague of mine of a student who was manifesting a fine atheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of Christian doctrine have often enough shown a temper which, psychologically considered, is indistinguishable from religious zeal.\\"As a scientist, James proceeds in this study as a strict empiricist. As a philosophical pragmatist (practicably and on the whole, \\"the true is what works well\\"), he finds that objects, after all, can only be considered and \\"known\\" subjectively. To 'experience' a material 'object' or phenomena is to be in an intellectual state that is essentially subjective. Thus, although science is the interrogation of the material world, the \\"truth\\" content of a dogmatic materialism is a pretension at best and a delusion at worst. James says, \\"The further limits of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of existence from the sensible and merely 'understandable' world. Name it the mystical region, or the supernatural region, whichever you choose. . . we belong to it in a more intimate sense than that in which we belong to the visible world, for we belong in the most intimate sense wherever our ideals belong.\\" To the extent that \\"religion\\" tends strongly to understand this while \\"science\\" today tends impulsively to deny it, religion may exhibit the clearer vision of reality (and of psychological 'healthy-mindedness'), regardless of science's impressive inventory of material 'facts'.As the author instructs, the reader should patiently wade through these lectures. The conclusions toward which he labors are not generally apparent before they are reached. At points throughout the text, both the 'religionist' and the 'anti-religionist' may believe that James is given to championing their respective positions, only to soon understand him differently. While the study is one of empirical psychology, the conclusions are inescapably philosophical (conclusions always are). The author briefly considers the classic theological arguments (cosmological, teleological, etc) and finds them to be logically elegant, yet less than universally compelling. Where [psychological] temperament leads, thought tends to follow. More compelling to James is a theologic / religious / epistemic warrant that seems highly amenable to (perhaps identical to) so-called reformed epistemology. Dogmatic philosophical materialism is inherently an arbitrarily limited window to reality. For the naturalist and the supernaturalist alike, personal experience and 'temperament' are the arbiters of reality. The book is important, in large part, because it has no obvious partisan constituency. Empiricists and mystics alike may find certain aspects of this study to be of merit. Philosophical skeptics won't like it, but of course ultimately they won't like anything."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"I am neither a psychologist nor a theologian. I picked up this book because I had insomnia one night, and thought it would put me to sleep. Contrary to my expectations, it was fascinating. While I will not delve into a discussion about the major tenets of the book(other people already have and have done a much better job than I am capable of) I will say, the strength of this book is James' ability to convey complicated ideas in a straightforward way. It is not at all like modern philosophical texts, which tend to be convoluted at best. Because the book is based on Lectures he delivered in Scotland, it has a conversational tone, that makes it almost fun to read. Most importantly, the ideas behind it and the scope of the work, are accessible to anyone who reads it, which, is really the point of writing seminal texts like this. While it is not an especially quick read, the topics he covers, conversion, 'the sick soul', etc are so interesting that you can't help but stay focused. I appreciated the insight into, not only psychology, but also American religious/spiritual/self improvement movements, which make this book still relevant today. I am glad I read it."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"James was a pioneer in the fledgling field of psychology. He was also a philosopher and held an M.D. degree. In 1902, he was the first American to be invited to give one of the prestigous \\"Gifford Lectures on Natural Theology\\" at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. The lectures were given over the period of one academic year with the expectation that they would be edited and printed in book form. \\"Natural Theology\\" was then considered to be some concept of God based on scientific proof rather than so-called \\"miracles\\". \\"Theology\\" was an all-inclusive term that included psychology, cultural writings, politics, traditions and mythology, among other things, and it was not confined to Christian tradition. It just so happens that James was of a Christian background but considered himself a \\"pragmatist\\". Its slant is definitely psychological in nature and applicable to anyone having a religous bent.It is easy to be blinded by the sublime quality of James's writing and flawless logic. \\"Varieties\\" is a masterpiece of genius but it is not the only book written by James. And it would be a mistake to believe that the whole of James's thinking is contained within it's pages.By the time his lectures ended, people were literally hanging in the windows and clinging to the chandeliers to hear him speak. And they were not disappointed. After a year of lectures, James concluded that there are forces outside of ourselves that influence our actions.James's point was not lost on either the listeners of the time or me. Aside from James's obvious genius, what are we to make of his conclusion that forces outside of ourselves influence our actions? We have yet to answer the \\"what\\", \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" posed by his conclusion. The book is not an end in itself. It raises too many vital questions of our existence that are in need of furher examination.Alcoholics Anonymous was founded in the 1940s by a man named Bill Wilson who believed that the only cure for alcoholism is helping other alcoholics to become sober, relying on a \\"higher power\\" in order to sustain sobriety. Wilson's book, \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\" references only one authoritative source and that is the \\"Varieties of Religous Experience\\". Wilson made no comment about James's book other than to list it as his only reference. But it is clear why he did it. James's reference to a power outside of our own consciousness became the \\"higher power\\" of Wilson's philosophy.This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone, Christian or not, who is intellectually drawn to understand the \\"mystic\\" part of our humanity."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"I agree with some commentators about how difficult is to read this book. Yes, there are numerous quotations that are tedious and after the first reading I have not read again but, there is a treasure of quotes that would be difficult to find nowadays that shed enourmous light to the subject at hand and are worth reading and rereading. In his conclusion he writes: \\" Although the religious question is primarily a question of life, of living or not living in the higher union which opens itself to us as a gift, yet the spiritual excitement in which the gift appears a real one will often fail to be aroused in an individual until certain particular intellectual beliefs or ideas are touched. These ideas will thus be essential to that individula's religion\\". What Mr. James did to me in this book is to arouse some very deep spiritual ideas that has completely transformed my way of thinking. These ideas came clad in his psycholoical interpretations. It has taken over a year of working with this book combined with an array of other books to find \\"my truth\\" but this book was the key to all. If you hated this book, as a few people have, it is ok, his truth was not for you and you need to find it in some other books. But if this book grabs you do not let go of it. Mark it, highlight it and keep coming back to it until you finally grasp some of its deeper meanings.By the way, the copy of the book I own is from Barnes and Noble Classics and only costs $7.95 at the store or cheaper online at their site."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"It is often said of classics that one is meant to know about but not actually read them. How many believers in evolution have actually waded through Darwin's dry tome?

I'd seen the book quoted so many times by other authors that finally I decided to see what it was all about, and I'm glad I did. The many quotes I'd read from the book at various times were no substitite for the real thing. Don't be put off by what may appear from the outside as one of those dry comparative religion books. This is not about ecclesiastics, ceremonials, or creeds, but focuses on the common religious experience underlying mankind's various religions and philosophies. It shows that the religious experience and its effect on the individual is a process not limited to any religion or belief, but a phenomenon underlying the human experience. As it is such a powerful personal experience, it has led to the formation of many religions, but these have generally had the effect of stifling spiritual growth. No-one has a monopoly on spirituality, however much some religions try to promote such a misconception.Interesting is his distinction between 'once-born' and 'twice-born' people (not to be confused with the Christian concept of 'born-again' - not all born-again Christians are twice-born, while not all twice-borns are born-again Christians, which for many just means an acceptance of the Christian creeds, a belief that Christ died for one's salvation). The twice-born person has gone through a period of intense spiritual suffering, their 'long dark night of the soul', and come out at the other end a new individual, with new spiritual insights and a new perpective on life and its challenges. Some born-again Christians do fit this description, but not many. One could reject one's Christianity, but one could never revert from twice to once-born.We all know people who've never given a thought about spirituality, life or death. Generally, but not always, they are people who quickly found a comfortable place in society, and have not had a major spiritual crisis to shake them up a bit, or lack the sensibility to be affected by them when they do occur. These are the once-born individuals referred to by James. Until genuine spiritual growth occurs in such people they are likely to remain uninterested in anything but the physical, or remain unthinkingly devout to the religion which they were, quite by chance, born into, and if they had to review a book like this, would be unlikely to award more than a single star.I cannot recommend reading this book more strongly. Its one of those books that you'll never forget because in some undefinable way it leaves your a changed person. Having read many other more modern books on a similar theme, I can only say it more than favourably compares to many of them. The English is clearly early twentieth century, but still lucid and very readable, with few of the horrible literary devices with which many of the learned both then and now try to make their works more 'academic'."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This is an intelligent survey of what happens when mankind invented religion as a part of it's social order.

It has been a great pleasure to be in the company of such a rational, good-willed and articulate thinker for nearly 500 pages. I was interested in the subject matter, and amazed by many of the examples he quotes of extreme religious devotion (though the quoted passages are sometimes too tediously extensive), but most of all I was interested in his method. He was working out a way to think rationally about irrational, or supra-rational, experiences.With a very courteous acknowledgement of \\"[a]n American philosopher of eminent originality, Mr. Charles Sanders Peirce,\\" he adopts Peirce's name for the method, pragmatism, and paraphrases Peirce's 1878 article laying out its principles. (\\"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\\", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 286-302. Reprinted widely, including Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce).I won't try to summarize the entire book here; summaries are readily available in Wikipedia and other 'net sources. James is not at all a conventional church-going believer, and confesses that he has no gift for any mystical experience at all. However, unlike such uncompromising atheists as Richard Dawkins or Daniel Dennett, he respects the authentic (i.e., not play-acting) prophets and mystics as possessors of a kind of \\"truth,\\" one which is irrefutably true for them: Santa Teresa, San Juan de la Cruz, George Fox, Joseph Smith, Luther, Gautama Buddha, Mohammed and many others, including Mary Baker Eddy. However, the felt truth of these experiences (visions of God, for example) does not mean they should be accepted as true by anyone who has not personally had them. \\"The gods we stand by are the gods we need and can use, the gods whose demands on us are reinforcements of our demands on ourselves and on one another,\\" he writes in the 14th lecture, \\"The Value of Saintliness.\\" (p. 303)He separates the question of the source of religious vision, which may be anything from an epileptic fit (e.g., St. Paul) to herbal intoxication or simply deep inward reflection, from its \\"truth,\\" by which he means something like its practical utility. He quotes extensive psychological research (in particular, the studies of a Dr. Starbuck in California) to affirm that \\"conversion\\" is an almost universal experience of adolescence, because it is psychologically necessary. By conversion he means a turning away from the chaotic and contradictory messages that assail every young person to find some \\"process of unification of the self\\" which always brings \\"a characteristic sort of relief; and never such extreme relief as when it is cast into the religious mould. Happiness! happiness! religion is only one of the ways in which men gain that gift.\\" (p. 163)That's because the conversion need not be toward religion. \\"The new birth may be away from religion into incredulity; or it may be from moral scrupulosity into freedom and license; or it may be produced by the irruption into the individual's life of some new stimulus or passion, such as love, ambition, cupidity, revenge, or patriotic demotion.\\" (163-164) Whatever works for you. For many of us, and apparently for James himself, the \\"new birth\\" was into incredulity, i.e., non-believing in a deity. Although James retained some doubt (see his \\"Conclusions\\"). After all, his father was a noted Swedenborgian philosopher.But James is concerned not only about the utility of religious experience for the individual believer, but also about its social utility, its consequences for human society generally. While his language is not entirely clear here, it appears that he does not accept as pragmatic \\"truth\\" the kinds of religious sentiment that he calls extreme \\"Devoutness.\\" \\"When unbalanced, one of its vices is called Fanaticism. Fanaticism is only loyalty carried to a convulsive extreme. ... The Buddha and Mohammed and their companions and many Christian saints are incrusted with a heavy jewelry of anecdotes which are meant to be honorific, but are simply abgeschmackt and silly, and form a touching expression of man's misguided propensity to praise. ... An immediate consequence of this condition is jealousy for the deity's honor.\\" (310-311) Which leads to such absurdities as the riots over Danish cartoons, or Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's placement of the 2.6-ton granite monument of the Ten Commandments in the state building.I think James was right to respect the personal truth of serious religious believers, and equally right to insist that their truth need not be anybody else's and certainly should not be imposed on anyone. We all have \\"spiritual\\" needs, he thinks -- that is, we need some way to put together our otherwise fragmenting \\"self.\\" (James' notion of \\"self\\" seems to anticipate Dennett's formulation of it as \\"the center of narrative gravity.\\") But we don't all need to do it the same way. A coherent atheism, or a \\"healthy-minded\\" optimism, or a born-again union with the One, are equally valid ways to achieve the \\"gift\\" of \\"happiness,\\" or integration of the self. Whether they are equally good or not depends on their consequences, not only for ourselves individually but in our actions on behalf of others. Makes sense to me."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"For years, I have seen this book referenced by other authors and was curious to read the original. I'm wading through James' early twentieth century prose now, and it's worth the effort. He builds his case masterfully, with an attention to detail and logic that refreshes someone raised in an age of sound bites. And many of his ideas about the mystical experience seem to have caused echoes in contemporary works by michael rich and Caroline Myss, to name two. It's definitely worth the effort to bridge the generation gap."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This is a work of research. James gathers together accounts of the mystical meeting with God from the panoply of the world's religious traditions. One of his conclusions not surprisingly is that people often come to meet the conception or intellectual construct or content in regard to God that they have brought with them.James in collecting the evidence and analyzes and attempts to give an overall definition of the structure of the mystical religious experience. The case- histories are the evidence upon which the empiricist James will draw his conclusions.Among the famous distinctions that do make a difference in the work is the distinction between first- born and twice- born souls. The first born are those who are alright and happy in their lives. The twice- born are those upon whom James places the emphasis. These are the people who go through some 'dark night of the soul' in which they seem to lose themselves and their world, live in a blackness of Nothingness, until the miraculous transformation comes and they are born again as new beings. This being born again comes through their meeting with God. And again the God they discover is often the God of the religious tradition which they take in.It is interesting that in many of the accounts there is talk of merger with and fusion with God, of being absorbed by God. This is somewhat different from the Jewish mystical conception in which one can only approach G-d closer and closer but never really hope to be identical with the One and Only One.One interesting aspect of the work is James' use of his own experience, his own personal depression as one of the case - histories. In his case it was not the encounter with God which saved him, but ' the will to freedom' which he learned from the French thinker Renouvier. Paralyzed and loss his act of will to freedom would constitute in a deep psychological way a repudiation of the life of his own Swedenborgian mystical father, and lead to his own supremely active life.James summary conclusions about these experiences and about the mystical encounter lead him not to one definite conclusion, but rather to something like Wittgenstein's family resemblance of overlapping categories of classification.In these he tries too to use pragmatic categories of judgment and understand what he calls the ' cash value ' of the experience i.e. its real benefit in the person's future life. James also talks about something which is certainly not the God most of the mystics have found. They believe and connect with an Infinite Power, but James in his own life and thought seeing the force of Evil in the world held on to the idea of a ' finite God ' who aims at good and needs the help of humanity to realize the right goals in history .This idea in someway parallels the Jewish religious idea of covenant partnership with God, in Tikkun Olam the transformation of the world for good.It is impossible in a review like this to do justice to this great work, and the great mind and human being who compiled and composed it. It is a must for anyone who cares to better know and understand the religious life. The conclusions they draw may not be James' but they will be helped in understanding religious life better, nonetheless."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"The font is so small that it hurts your eyes to read it.

I realize such a definition, which I heard elsewhere as a definition of pragmatism, will send certain intellectual readers into orbit, but I've learned that if I couldn't explain something in simple (not synonymous with simplistic) terms, I didn't know enough about the subject. This definition works for me to describe what Mr. James asks in these lectures: Does religion 'work'?He answers that religious belief does 'work' for a large number of people and, rather than turning them into fanatics, helps to not only get through the dark nights, but, for some, makes them joyful, kind and physically healthy. How, he asks, can this be called 'untrue'? Even if there is no God, the placebo effect, so to speak, works 'scientifically' and if we accept it in medicine, why not accept it in religion?Mr. James, during this presentation of lectures on religion at the University of Edinburg, surveys the effects various types of religious beliefs have on the believers. It is a delightful journey, clearly written (especially notable for being written in 1902) with Mr. James charming use of examples from interviews and letters of believers of various types. I especially liked his survey of the New Thought movement of the late nineteenth century America and noted it's echoes, I assume from the blurbs I've read, in the recent book \\"The Secret\\".I have read this book twice and now am reading certain chapters again and it remains fresh over a hundred years since he gave these lectures. I find his views on science and religion, and their interaction, especially relevant in the recent \\"believer vs. nonbeliever\\" diatribes we listen to today which supposedly pass as \\"discussions.\\"For example, Mr. James states: \\"Evidently, then, the science and the religion are both of them genuine keys for unlocking the world's treasure-house to him who can use either of them practically. Just as evidently neither is exhaustive or exclusive of the other's simultaneous use. And why, after all, may not the world be so complex as to consist of many interpenetrating spheres of reality, which we can thus approach in alternation by using different conceptions and assuming differnt attitudes, just as mathematicians handle the same numerical and spatial facts by geometry, by analytical geometry, by algebra, by the calculus, or by quaternions, and each time come out right?\\" p. 110 of my 1967 Collier ed.Mr. James is the sort of human you feel you could discuss anything with and he would never raise his voice, make ad hominen attacks or think you a dolt no matter what lunacy you espoused. Would that we had more of such gentlemen and women today."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This new edition of philosopher / psychologist William James most enduring work, \`The Varieties of Religious Experience' should show that this book is as valuable today as it was over 100 years ago when it was first published in 1902. William James is credited with being a philosopher as he gets credit for being the cofounder, with friend Charles Saunders Peirce of the distinctively American philosophical position of \`Pragmatism'. In fact, William James is much more of a psychologist than a philosopher who contributed, with Sigmund Freud, to the separation of clinical psychology from philosophy into a distinct discipline. This means that while Wm. James' philosophical works were a bit amateurish when compared to professional Peirce, his knowledge of the history of philosophy is profound and this knowledge pervades and elevates this work of psychology subtitled \`A Study in Human Nature'.I will be immensely pleased if this little review convinces a single person to discover the richness of this work as I did when I first read it over 40 years ago when I was in High School. It probably reinforced my interest in becoming a professional philosopher. While I never got my philosopher's union card (Ph.D.), my interest in the subject stays alive and my regard for this book continues to grow.The original work is based on a series of twenty (20) Gifford lectures on natural religion presented by Wm. James to an audience at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. This is no small honor to James, as it represents a reverse of the traditional flow of original intellectual work from Europe to the United States.\`Natural Religion' is probably a term not often used in academia today. It has probably disappeared by being split into philosophy of religion (which is something quite different from Theology) and main stream clinical psychology. And, I have a bit of a suspicion that this study may actually have fallen into obscurity by simple neglect or embarrassment similar to the embarrassment overcome by Dr. Kinsey when he did his study of sexuality. It may be that the very act of studying religion may be seen as blasphemous. If this musing is correct, then I feel even more strongly that a knowledge of James arguments and findings cannot be more important than they are today with the growing influence of fundamentalists and issues over the separation of church and state. This book does not solve those issues, but knowledge of this book can help clarify the issues in the minds of people who deal with policy in this area.The first thing to understand about this book is its point of view. And, the title says it all. It is about \`religious experience' and how this is different from, say, scientific observation, artistic experience, or even erotic experience, although there are probably some very strong family resemblences between religious, artistic, and erotic experiences. That means the book is not about doctrines, liturgy, theology, myths, language, or political leanings. To a great extent, James shapes what he means by religion by the scope of his inquiry. In Lecture II, James goes to great lengths to caution his audience on not putting to rigid a framework on the subject before the investigation gets underway, as the investigation may take one into unexpected directions. But, one can hardly begin unless there is a starting point. Even the simplest experiment begins with a supposition, as when you go about measuring the effects of heat on sugar, you assume that melted sugar will always behave the same way at a given temperature. So, in Lecture III, James characterizes \`...the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. This belief and this adjustment are the religious attitude in the soul.' Like James, I am neither an anthropologist nor historian of religions, but I do get a slight sense that this statement has slanted his inquiry toward those religions where a strong single godhead is the most important belief. I may be wrong, but I sense James definition may be leaving out things like Zen Buddhism. But, I believe this simply makes the work more interesting an object of contemporary study.Of one thing I am certain. This starting point clearly makes the phenomenon of mystical experience the central object of interest in these lectures. Throughout lectures IV to XV, many points are deferred to a full discussion of mysticism that takes up two full lectures, XVI and XVII. I confess this focus is part of my interest in this book, as one of my high school fantasies was to join a contemplative monastic order, and I wasn't even Catholic. And, here comes the discovery of an important work by an American intellectual icon on precisely the subject that so enthralled me at the time.James four (4) characteristics of mystical experience set the stage for his final conclusion that arises from this definition as inexorably as the curvature of space arises out of Einstein's theory of gravity. The characteristics are:1. Ineffability. The experience defies expression in words.2. Noetic quality. They give the sense of knowing about something that those who did not have a similar experience cannot know.3. Transiency. Mystical experiences cannot last very long.4. Passivity. While voluntary rituals or practices may bring on the experience, once the experience begins, the mystic's own will shuts down and experiences are directed by some superior power.In case advocates of religion belittle this clinical approach, I would mention that philosophy has successfully demolished all logical arguments for God, while the evidence of mystics survives to this day.James philosophical works are nothing more than history. His other psychological works have been superseded by the progress of new work in clinical psychology. This book is as alive today as it was 100 years ago!"},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This book is based on a series of Lectures that the late William James gave at the turn of the century. What makes James' writing so odd in the world of religious studies is his refreshingly realistic take on religion and human nature considering it was written previous to the first world war. In an age where people were remarkably positive about human kind and our collective destiny James' views were certainly unpopular. James, however, was ahead of his time. We look back on his work from a century later through the lens of the most bloody and brutal century mankind can remember and find James' assertions to be entirely too accurate.This was one of the first academic books on the subject of religious experience and is thus extremely important. William James demonstrates such a wide scope of knowledge on the subject that reading this book is like opening a window into the world of nineteenth century religious movements. Considering the amount of important developements that occured within religion at the time: The Quakers, The abolishionists, Mormons, etc. This book can be extremely useful in that aspect as well.It is certainly worth reading if you have an interest inreligious experience or in nineteenth century religion.

Exp. page 160-161, that has been ignored by so-called scholars:\\"I went one evening into a dressing-room in the twilight to procure some article that was there, when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear or my own existence. Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an epileptic patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black-haired youth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all day on one of the benches, or rather shelves against the wall, with his knees drawn up against his chin, and the coarse gray undershirt, which was his only garment, drawn over them inclosing (sic) his entire figure. He sat there like a sort of sculptured Egyptian cat or Peruvian mummy, moving nothing but his black eyes and looking absolutely non-human. This image and my fear entered into a species of combination with each other. That shape am I, I felt potentially. Nothing that I possess can defend me against that fate, if the hour for it should strike for me as it struck for him. There was such a horror of him, and such a perception of my own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a mass of quivering fear. After this the universe was changed for me altogether. I awoke morning after morning with a horrible dread at the pit of my stomach, and with a sense of the insecurity of life that I never knew before, and that I have never felt since. It was like a revelation; and although the immediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me sympathetic with the morbid feelings of others ever since. It gradually faded, but for months I was unable to go out into the dark alone. In general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how other people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so unconscious of that pit of insecurity beneath the surface of life. . . .I have always thought that this experience of melancholia of mine had a religious bearing.\\"Similar to John Bunyan, James has had, to quote Woody Allen, \\"a moving religious experience.\\" To deal with this experience, James eventually dabbled in occult studies to account for its significance. The result was that James came to embrace a gnosticism. The core of gnosticism, whether framed in classical terms or in terms of existentialism, is to wipe out the subject/object relationship. In order to do this, the elimination of consciousness as a really distinct reality becomes pertinent. We see this in James when he writes an essay entitled \\"Does 'Consciousness' Exist?\\" This essay can be found in a volume of James's work entitled \\"Essays in Radical Empiricism.\\"James's experience, as narrated by himself, resembles Sartre's character Roquentin, in Sartre's \\"Nausea.\\" It also relates to the experience of Edward John Carnell.Why these idiots at Ivey League colleges ignore James the man while trying to understand James the thinker, puzzles me.

James places much emphasis on personal experiences, and less emphasis on religious institutions. James looks at the religion of the healthy minded from the perspective of making you active. He describes the religion of the healthy minded as \\"a tendency which looks on all things and sees that they are good.\\" This is different from the sick soul that groans and worries over evil. The worries of the sick soul must faint away in order for conversion to take place. James looks at conversion as \\"... the process, gradual or sudden, by which a self hitherto divided, and consciously wrong inferior and unhappy, becomes unified and consciously right superior and happy, in consequence of its firmer hold upon religious realities.\\" James gives two ways in which one can overcome the worries, anger, fear and other undesirable affections: when an opposite affection overpowers us and by getting so exhausted with the struggle that we just have to stop and don't care any longer. I find these two ways very true. James insights here are very helpful for counsellors and spiritual directors. I highly recommend his work."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"William James's position is simple: he claimed to have no living sense of commerce with a God, deity, and the Divine for his life was limited to impersonal and abstract concepts which, as ideals, interested and determined him. The Varieties of Religious Experience, therefore, in apropos to his living philosophy, is not a pedagogy of religious doctrines, creeds, and channel to salvation. It is rather an objective treatment of the various phenomena encountered in religions at a psychological perspective. James disclaimed to emphasize readers' mind of the enormous diversities which the spiritual lives of different men exhibit. Each of the subtopics (i.e. healthy-mindedness, sick soul, conversion, saintliness, mysticism, and philosophy) contributes an extraction from the privacies of religious experience some general facts which can be defined in formulas upon which everyone may agree.James has laid out the ultimate goal of the book in the first chapter: The quest for a mandatory general theory as to what the peculiarities in an entity should be which give it value for purposes of revelation. Such a theory, James throughout the book reminds and contends, should be a spiritual judgment according which an entity lays its foundation of values. Whatever conclusions one might arrive regarding religion, which is, after all, a private collection of a person's thoughts, emotions, and feelings, can be reached only by spiritual judgments which prompts sobriety. James concerns religion only at a personal level for religion is nothing more than the inner dispositions of man himself which form the center of interest, his conscience, his virtues, his vices, his helplessness, and his incompleteness - aspects that are at complete contrariety to the ecclesiastical organization. Religion appeals more like man's conscience or morality.James for the purpose of better illustrating his points on many occasions throughout the book uses very extreme examples. For example, ascetism practiced by saints could be self-mortifying and pathological. But James constantly reminds us that only through the most eccentric and extreme case studies are we able to see the more profound and distinguishing information. The plethora of examples also safeguard the book from the common downfall of over-simplification in defining religion, which is the root of all absolution and one-sided dogmatism by which both philosophy and religion have been infested. The examples also demonstrate the reason for a variety of religions and the need of different religions. Lives of all men should not show identical religious elements because it is impossible that human beings in such different positions and with such different powers as human individuals are should have exactly the same functions and the same duties. Each from his peculiar angle of observation should take in a certain sphere of fact and trouble, challenges and goals, which each must deal with in a unique manner at the appropriate time.Another battleground is the conflict between science and religion. Knowledge about life (which is usually corroborated by religion) is one thing, effective occupation of a place in life, James contends, with its \\"dynamic currents passing through\\" one's being, is another. For this very reason, the science of religion may never be an equivalent of a living religion, which primarily concerns the interest of the individual in his private personal destiny and the thoughts that are carried on in terms of personality; and if one obdurately turns to the inner difficulties of such a science, one sees that a point comes when science must drop the purely theoretic attitude. Metaphysical attributes of God, so much as they are merited by the intellectuals, must go because the meaning of any thought that finds its rest in belief is only determined by the conduct it is fitted to produce. James believes feeling is the deeper source of religion, and philosophic and theological formulas are secondary products. Philosophy therefore can act as a mediator to redeem religion from unwholesome privacy and to give public status and universal right of way to its deliverances. For in theology, verbality has stepped into the place of vision and professionalism into that of life, resulting in a conglomeration of abstract, pedantic terms that have given the gist of one's knowledge of deity. After all, what really sustain religion are the private emotions, feelings, and sentiment.James also devotes a great deal of his book on mysticism and sub consciousness. Human beings are alive or dead to the eternal inner message of the arts according as they have kept or lost the mystical susceptibility. Mystical experiences are ineffable, transient and passive. They are like sudden invasions of vaguely reminiscent consciousness. The conviction that \\"something\\" is genuinely transacted in this consciousness is the very core of living religion. James explains that this subliminal region is a continuation of the ordinary consciousness and manifests in the shape of a set of thoughts, feelings, and memories which are extra-marginal and outside of the primary consciousness altogether, but yet must be classified as conscious facts of some sort. And this is the central idea with which James pieces everything together: In religion we have a department of human nature with unusually close relations to the transmarginal or subliminal region. This religion, which is obviously the larger, unplumbed part of each of us in regard to among all states of consciousness, is the abode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of everything that passes unrecorded or unobserved. It harbors the spring of all our obscurely motived passions, impulses, likes, dislikes, and prejudices. Our limitations, hypotheses, fancies, superstitions, persuasions, convictions and in general all our non-rational operations come from this region. People, regardless of what religions they belong, share this common trait in the subliminal region. In persons deep in the religious life, the door into this region seems unusually wide open.The Varieties of Religious Experience gives a closer look in the behaviors evoked from the various religions. It is not meant to discredit any religions nor promotes specific faiths; it aims to map out how far certain attributes, be they metaphysical or moral, can be considered true."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"I read this book while I was a doubting Mormon missionary.

He explains the logic behind various ways of thinking without entirely condemning any of these views. James dips into sixth sense experiences and discusses the validity of these experiences based on their unanimity as well as the insignificance of unanimity and more importantly the changes personal experiences can cause in someone's life. Touching on various topics James leaves little unexplained and at the same time stresses the lack of scientific knowledge on many of these subjects and therefore our inability to draw specific conclusions. This book is carefully constructed and can be enlightening for those of us who lack in-depth knowledge of the subject or for the most seasoned researchers."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"William James's &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; is about the psychology of religion, two subjects which under normal circumstances hardly interest me, but its appeal for readers who have no interest in the psychology of religion is literary rather than scholarly. Transcribed from a series of lectures, James's book investigates man's need for religion -- the stimuli, besides institutional or parental influences, that compel a person to be truly religious, to have a deep spiritual communication with a higher power that surpasses in significance the mindless attendance of prayer services and recitation of liturgies by rote at the prompting of some guy in a robe standing behind a pulpit.James discloses that he is neither a theologian nor a religious person himself, which gives him two advantages -- first, that he presents his subject as an empirical science rather than groundless philosophy or internal speculation, and second, that he is free of bias, for how could a religious person be trusted not to sway the study exclusively towards his own experiences? Variety is the key, and religious experiences are necessarily as various as fingerprints; James's purpose is not to identify the commonalities that group a certain selection of people into a single organized religion but to highlight their differences.The religious phenomena discussed in the book cover a wide range of concepts like conversion, fanaticism, asceticism, sacrifice, saintliness, and mysticism, which James defines more or less as a state of consciousness invoked by a transient surge of sensation rather than by mental effort. The religious urge, James concludes, comes from an inherent sense of &quot;wrongness&quot;: Man, being imperfect or aware of imperfections in himself, needs God or a higher power to represent perfection and to save him from his wrongness.One thesis is on the happiness that results from religious satisfaction, to which &quot;mind cures,&quot; involving the association of a healthy body with a healthy mind, are related. James then introduces the idea of the &quot;sick soul,&quot; in which he asserts that evil, by which he means hopelessness and pessimism, is a disease -- a notion, incidentally, that had been satirized by Samuel Butler in &quot;Erewhon.&quot; Another interesting insight, reminiscent of the theme of Flannery O'Connor's &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; is the observation that the atheistic denial of God has a religiously zealous temperament of its own.Even though these are lectures, James doesn't do all the talking. He frequently relates people's religious experiences in their own words; in fact, I estimate that quotations and footnotes constitute more than half of the text. The recipient of a thorough education, James was one of the great American intellectual voices of his century but is never pedantic; his fluent prose bears strangely little resemblance to the garish constructions of his novelist brother Henry. The book's emphasis on psychology may surprise a reader who expects a work on traditional theology, and its impartiality may offend one who insists on the absolute sovereignty of his own religion, but James deserves credit for a perspective that is original and intelligent without intending to be controversial."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"I wanted to read this book because I heard it discussed by Mervyn Bragg and a panel of academics on BBC radio4. Although written at the beginning of the 20th century, the series of lectures which make up the book, seem to address some of the preoccupations routinely highlighted today among scientists who dispute the validity of religious experience, and its enduring importance in all human cultures. James did not set out to prove the existence of God when he took up the appointment of Gifford Lecturer on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh in 1902. As a psychologist his main focus of interest was to be 'the religious propensities of man' which he considered to be just as interesting as any other human mental experience. James describes the nature of religious conversion, with special emphasis on its startling suddenness, especially in relation to former sinners. In another lecture he considers the experiences of mysticism, and in others he looks at the characteristics of sanitliness, devotion and asceticism. In all these deliberations James combines a scientific detachment with a keen absorbtion in his subject matter. This attitude is what makes the book so interesting, despite the fact that it is written in a discursive and extended style characteristic of that period in history."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This one book has done more to change the way I look at religion than any other work I have ever read. What I truly love about this book is the way that William James looks at the micro instead of focusing on the macro. He looks at the individual experiences with religion instead of looking at the group. This gives the reader the much more personalized view of religion, and how it interacts with the individual. His interviews with a broad range of people with an equal range of differing religious experiences gives the reader a rich assortment of the varieties of religious experience.The most important aspect of this book, though, is the method of analysis used by James. Looking at religious experiences through psychology allows the reader to not only look at the personalized religious experience, but also lets us see that experience broken down by one of the world's foremost experts of his time and one of the greatest minds in U.S. history. This is the strength of this work.The only criticism I will offer is that some of the material can become redundant. After James describes a particular religious experience he then provides numerous personal examples of this experience. This allows the reader to see the similarities along with the subtle deviations as well between individual experiences of religious phenomenon. The problem is that sometimes he provides more of these personal experiences than needed which makes certain sections seem a bit tedious and redundant. This problem is easily remedied by the reader if he/she will simply read enough of these experiences to get a good understanding then skip the rest of these when they start to become redundant.This book was an invaluable contribution to my own understanding of religion. This greater understanding has enriched my life, and helped me to become much more understanding of the people around me. While I am not religious, this book has helped me understand those who are in a whole new way, and it has also informed my own agnosticism. I would recommend this book for anyone even remotely interested in religion."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This 1902 publication still takes pride of place as a landmark study and remains one of the most influential books ever on psychology and spirituality.

Wilson was admitted to hospitals repeatedly for his drunkenness, and the doctors had declared him hopeless, that he would soon end up in the grave or an insane asylum. During his last hospital stay, he surrendered his will to a God he hadn't before believed in, and he never drank again.\\"The Varieties of Religious Experience\\" is a series of twenty lectures given by James in 1901 and 1902. His lectures examine the enormous diversity of religious life exhibited by humankind. It is a fact that religious and spiritual beliefs are a large part of human nature, and James examines how the wants, susceptibilities, and capacities of humankind vary greatly and result in different types of religious experience. It's also a proven fact that we benefit from religion in many ways. It gives us serenity, moral poise, happiness, and meaning and purpose.In his lecture on the sick soul, James describes Tolstoy's religious melancholy and \\"thirst for God.\\" In his fifties, Tolstoy fell into a state of anhedonia which is characterized by an inability to enjoy the pleasures of life and the feeling that life is absurd and meaningless. He also delves into the divided self of St. Augustine, who notoriously said, \\"Lord give me chastity and continence - but not yet.\\"His lecture on the value of saintliness could also be a commentary on the consumerism of our culture. As he says, lives based on having material possessions are less free than lives based on doing and being. We cling to our worldly possessions and seek God at the same time the way a drug addict seeks recovery but cannot accept total abstinence. \\"The wealth-bound man must be a slave, while a man for whom poverty has no terror has become a free man.\\"I also gleaned much twelve step philosophy from these pages. James included several examples of men being saved from drunkenness by conversion experiences much like Bill Wilson's. He lists case after case of men receiving instant peace upon surrendering their will to God after much struggling and resisting. This is step three in action - We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood him. Thus his description of letting go: \\"Passivity, not activity; relaxation, not intentness, should now be the rule.Give up the feeling of responsibility, let go your hold, resign the care of your destiny to higher powers, be genuinely indifferent as to what becomes of it all, and you will find not only that you gain a perfect inward relief, but often also, in addition, the particular goods you sincerely thought you were renouncing.\\" His description of confession as soul-cleansing is also a description of steps four, five, and ten. \\"For him who confesses, shams are over and realities have begun; he has exteriorized his rottenness.\\" It's a shame the Protestants didn't keep this spiritual purification practice when they separated from the Catholic Church.\\"The Varieties of Religious Experience\\" contains much more than what I've mentioned here. His lectures cover topics such as mysticism, philosophy, religion and neurology, the sick soul and conversion just to name a few. He tackles these subjects as a psychologist and not a theologian, so you get an unbiased view of the nature and origins of religious belief. It has given me a better understanding of my own spiritual nature, and I believe my life is more enriched for having read it.David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"The book is a series of lectures given by the author in 1901-02.

He does get into philosophy a bit, but it is not so encumbering that the individual untrained in philosophy will have a difficult time following. That is the power of James' writing.

So, I just had to say something. This is one of the greatest and most readable books ever written on the subject of religion. Don't be surprised at what you find. WJ is not making a &quot;case&quot; for belief here, or any case for any particular religious &quot;system&quot;. He is studying religious experience, trying to get to the bottom of what brings it about and what it means for human beings. Thus, he pays little attention to what we call &quot;organized religion.&quot; He spends his time, rather, with the various ways that people have experienced God or the supernatural or the spiritual. James's style is very subtle, ornate, and powerful. Just let yourself soak in it for awhile and then try to learn. His metaphors are so stunning as to be memorable for the rest of your life. His discussion of the healthy-minded, the sick soul, and the mystic will entrall you and thrill you with his erudition, and they will become touchstones in your own religious experience and your own study of religion for the rest of your life. Religion is a living reality for WJ. He gives a powerful analysis of what it can, should, and does mean to men and women in the modern world. If you wish to understand modern thought on religion, by the way, you must read James, for much of it springs from his thought. Lastly, James is the kindest thinker who ever put pen to paper. For those of in the William james Society, this is why we love him so. He never chides or derides or condemns. He gently disagrees, looks for the best from every idea and every experience and every person, and lavishes praise on what he finds excellent and meaningful. His thought and writing and philosophical depth and style are an inspiration. Spend some time with one of the greatest thinkers ever. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"The previous reviews are very good descriptions of this book. I'd like to reiterate that it helps while reading to remember that this is primarily a study of many case histories of very personal and profound experiences with God. They are mostly in the form of excerpts from autobiographies and memoirs, mainly Christian and contemporary (the book was published in 1903), but many also from other times and faiths. There is no addressing the pros and cons of organized religion here, or, for that matter, of questions like whether miracles really happen, etc.This book is a microcosm, though. James touches on so many matters of religion and, indeed, life and philosophy overall that the book makes valuable reading for anyone interested in humans generally.He talks, of necessity, quite a bit about the subconscious, which had just recently been &quot;invented,&quot; showing that profound religious experiences comes from there, though that doesn't mean that they're not of divine origin: perhaps it's our subconscious self that connects to God.James then analyzes these experiences from the pragmatic point of view of, Are these experiences healthy? What are their &quot;fruits&quot;?But there are no ultimate &quot;Answers&quot; of the kind you find suggested in other works of philosophy or theology. Despite some heady speculation towards the end, James sticks to the facts, and never expects his audience to accept anything unproven.Especially interesting, I thought, were the descriptions of \\"conversion,\\" a two-fold experience consisting of spiritual crisis and of release from that crisis and the reaching of a profound state of surety and, usually, happiness. Besides many others, he describes the conversion processes of John Bunyan (a schizophrenic) and Leo Tolstoy. James makes the very interesting comparison of the process (nowadays called &quot;being born again&quot;) with the natural process of adolescence, and speculates that conversion crisis, as encouraged by the Protestant churches, is perhaps one of the healthiest and safest ways of attaining adulthood.Also fascinating is James' description of \\"the Healthy-minded Individual,\\" who is born with a trusting assurance of God's loving presence, and who never goes through any crisis of conversion because he doesn't need to. I myself would doubt the existence of these lucky people, but then I recalled a person (my children's teacher) who is always cheerful, energetic, and kind, and who I sincerely believe has never lost her temper or been anything more than necessarily stern with her students, parents, and other teachers. She has a profound, almost instinctive, faith in God. That for me is living proof of the veracity of James' categories and conclusions.And James' own almost chivalrous kindness, honesty, and respect for us, his audience make me feel that he himself, whether \\"once-\\" or \\"twice-born,\\" had reached that higher level of morality and happiness; it made reading this book a profound and inspiring experience.Oddly, the preface (by Martin E. Marty) of the version of &quot;Varieties&quot; that I have (Penguin) does not mention the following, found in the preface to the William James volume of the &quot;Great Books&quot; series:&quot;James had been concerned with religion from an empirical point of view as early as 1869, when he had noted in a review the 'anomalous' and 'discreditable' attitude of a so-called enlightened society toward psychical phenomena. To ascertain the appropriate 'stall or pigeonhole' for these 'wild facts,' he helped organize the American Society for Psychical Research in 1884. Two years later he was invited to give the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh.&quot;On a vacation climb in the Adirondacks in 1898, James underwent a variety of religious experience: 'It seemed as if the Gods of all the nature-mythologies were holding an indescribable meeting in my breast with the moral Gods of the inner life....Doubtless in more ways than one, things in the Edinburgh lectures will be traceable to it,' he wrote his wife. The climb, however, overtaxed his heart, which would not have impaired his health if he had not essayed the Adirondacks the following summer and lost his way. There followed two years of complete collapse. Thus the Gifford Lectures were not finished until 1902, when they were also published in book form as 'The Varieties of Religious Experience.'&quot;"},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"You will not draw the nectar out of this book unless you are aware (the earlier the better) of James' premise that the stronghold of religion lies in individuality. These lectures are not a study of &quot;religion&quot; nor even a study of religious &quot;experiences&quot; in toto, but a study of &quot;individual&quot; religious experience. Singular. It sounds narrow only until you add the other word of the title... &quot;varieties.&quot;Why such an emphasis upon the individual? Because, as James states, the pivot around which the religious life revolves &quot;is the interest of the individual in his private personal destiny.&quot; All proper &quot;religion&quot; by such a definition must consist in an individual experiencing connection with that which he considers to be the higher power(s). In fact, at one point James states that &quot;prayer is real religion.&quot; And further, &quot;Wherever this interior prayer is lacking, there is no religion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises and stirs the soul, even in the absence of forms or of doctrines, we have living religion.&quot; A thought-provoking principle.You will never appease your hunger by staring at a menu. You have to actually open your mouth and &quot;experience&quot; the eating of some food. Similarly, we can only learn about religious experience by recounting the experiences of those who've done some profound religious eating (so to say). This is James' method. He renounces the ambition to be coercive in his arguments (this is not an apologetic work) and simply focuses on &quot;rehabilitating the element of feeling in religion and subordinating its intellectual part.&quot; He does this by the examination of diverse case histories.And he uses the &quot;extremer examples&quot; because these yield the profounder information. He called these types &quot;theopathic&quot; characters; those who tend to display excess of devotion. His reasoning is thus: &quot;To learn the secrets of any science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be eccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils. We combine what they tell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form our final judgment independently.&quot;Concerning this &quot;final judgment&quot; I found the following principle in the lecture entitled &quot;Mysticism&quot; to be particular liberating. As regards the extremely theopathic: &quot;No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those who stand outside of them to accept their revelations uncritically.&quot; A good word to hide in your heart against the next time some well-intentioned saint feels that their eccentricities should be yours.To be honest, I found the lecture entitled &quot;Philosophy&quot; to be fairly technical and daunting, but such criticism I charge to my own lack of knowledge in this area rather than to any deficiency in the book itself. Upon closing its covers, I was a satiated bee. The book is total nectar."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"Coming from an essentially secular upbringing, I thought religion was something I should learn about as part of a well-rounded liberal arts education. This book helped me to see that religion might also have something to say to me personally (as did Thomas Merton's \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\").\\"Varieties\\" is a wonderfully written exploration of the psychology of individual religious experience--whether within or without organized religion--by one of America's greatest philosophers and psychologists. It includes lots of interesting case studies and lots of insight. Major topics: conversion, saintliness, mysticism, and James's illuminating distinction between \\"healthy-minded\\" religion and that of the \\"sick soul.\\" Fun fact: the panicky, melancholic \\"Frenchman\\" near the end of the \\"Sick Soul\\" section is actually William James. Also noteworthy: this book was an important influence on \\"Bill W.,\\" co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous.(Another book I highly recommend on the psychology of religion: Gerald May's \\"Will and Spirit: A Contemplative Psychology.\\")"},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"This is a classic work explaining in a remarkably objective manner the many varieties and possibilities of religious experience. It well avoids the common trap of falling into a polemic either for or against religion; nor does it become a tract supporting Protestantism over Catholicism or vice-verse; or even Christianity over Islam or vice-versa. The book is extremely well-reasoned and liberally dosed with examples of the extremes of religiousity. These extremes not only make for entertaining reading, but James argues that we can learn more from the people who have felt the religious impulse strongly than we can from those who neatly fit religion into their otherwise secular lives. An over-weaning theme of the book is James's respect for the individual's experience of religion. As a result, this is not a book about the varieties of religions, as it does not compare Protestantism and Christianity; nor Judaism and Buddhism, or any other forms of established religion. In fact, in his chapter about mysticism, he argues that the established religions customarily treat mystics and mysticisms as heretics and heresy. Mysticism then either succumbs or successfully survives to either break off to become its own established religion or becomes absorbed into an established religion. By the time that has happened the individual aspects of mysticism are lost and are replaced by still further dogma.This book should really have been titled &quot;The Varieties of Christian Religious Experience,&quot; for it is only for Christianity (and to some extent Judaism) that James is well-versed enough to give a thorough examination. It is not that he does not respect Islam or Buddhism; it is that he doesn't know them well enough to draw them fully into the discussion."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"To call &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; a classic is an understatement. What I find really amazing is that it was written in 1902. James was first known for his work with &quot;functionalism&quot; in psychology, essentially making him the first modern psychologist --- moving psychology away from the realm of philosophy. Thus, we have psychology becoming an empirical science. The empirical methodology was used to explore items of interest in psychology and religion.Many books on religion express an interest in religion from the point of view of a theologian or person who studies religion from the point of view of religious institutions. To many people, religion means different things. It could be from the point of view of a &quot;born-again Christian,&quot; or it could be from a more personal point of view. We come to see religion as an existential phenomenon. We learn that it is an incredibly personal relation between the individual and his concept of the Divine. There is a definite emphasis on the personal aspects of religion.With experimental psychology, we deal in matters that are seen and are easily quantifiable. In the psychology of religion, we deal with how the individual deals with the reality of the unseen. We have a feeling of the presence of God. Some people can feel a mystical experience, whereas others have a more rational approach. People experience the divine in different manners - on the one hand, it can be impersonal and transcendental, and on the other hand it can be solemn, personal, and passionate. The religious tell us that religion can have the result of &quot;healthy mindedness&quot; -- in fact, it leads to a systematic sense of &quot;healthy mindedness&quot; diverting our attention from disease and death. This is more than just &quot;faith healing,&quot; but rather a prescription for a life of action. It leads to practical effectiveness. Another area of interest is sin and the &quot;sick soul&quot;, and the healthy effects of &quot;redemption.&quot; Other areas of interest are conversion, religious &quot;back-sliding,&quot; saintliness and living the good life, empiricism and skepticism, mysticism and philosophy, and aspects of religious worship service.I found that this book should have interest not just to students of the psychology of religion. It also has appeal to the religious, and those who want to find out more about the religious experience from a point of view that is a different from the views expressed in Church and Sunday School. The point of view is one that will appeal both to religious conservatives and to religious liberals. Its presentation is sensitive and logical. For some people, it may even produce the &quot;aha!&quot; response that they are now seeing religion with greater perspective.

This 1902 publication is justifiably considered as one of the 20th century's most influential books on psychology and spirituality.James considers the feelings, actions and experiences of individuals, insofar as they understand themselves to be in a relationship with whatever they consuider the divine. It is thus about the religion of everyday life and has nothing to do with churches and dogma.He writes objectively about a wide spectrum of religious experiences and quotes from the autobiographical writings of famous mystics from many traditions and of people like Whitman, Luther, Voltaire, Emerson, Tolstoy and many others. No religions are compared, only the experiences of the individual, and his arguments are well-reasoned.In his own words: \\"Both thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct may be determined either by feeling or thought. When we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have prevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian and Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories which religion generates, being thus variable, are secondary. If you wish to grasp its essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct as being the more constant elements.\\"This book is a treasure trove of insights and collected wisdom that simultaneously serves as a trenchant plea for religious tolerance. And yes, it does sometimes read like a gripping novel, especially the chapters on the religion of healthy-mindedness, the sick soul, and mysticism.The reader should be patient though. Although it is not a difficult text to grasp, every sentence is loaded with so much meaning that one has to return regularly to previous paragraphs in order to fully understand and process the arguments and insights. A thorough, patient study of the text will richly reward the reader.An even more rewarding experience can be had by studying Richard Maurice Bucke's \\"Cosmic Consciousness\\" and Stephan A. Hoeller's \\"The Gnostic Jung and the Seven Sermons to the Dead\\" at the same time.

For those, like me, who have a love and interest for the study of both psychology and religion, this is THE book on the psychology of religion. This book is the fruits of William James' appointment as Gifford Lecturer. The Gifford Lectures are a series of talks that have been given for the past century on natural theology at prestigious European universities.James eloquently outlines many, hundreds, of writings from the religious public. His list includes Jonathan Edwards, Martin Luther, Thomas Aquinas, Augustine and other prominent religious thinkers personal experience with their faith. Among these prominent members many more experiences from the common man are laid out in this book.James leaves doctrine and creed out of his observation and focuses strictly on individuals reported experience with their religious beliefs.James focus on experience and his use of self reports, memoirs and autobiographical writing can seem to go overboard at times. Those who follow James will find themselves skipping through the religious testimonies to hear James critique, which can be rather short at times. Nonetheless James offers a fairly objective critique of the experiences individuals have found within religious systems."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"A timeless and proufound book! Whatever you believe, there is much to be had in the Varieties. James weaves through the experiences of many different individuals, clarifying and illuminating both their inner and practical meaning. Decidedly, the book focuses on mystics, gnostics, the extremely devout and the chronically depressed at the exclusion of more mundane religious experiences. A very interesting bunch. Perhaps the most fascinating thing about the book: One of the depressed characters James mentions is none other than James himself! Similar to his father, Henry Sr., William had a psychological breakdown at about the age of thirty. As James describes it in his memoirs and letters, the nature of the breakdown was such that he had lost faith in free-will. As he asks in his psychology, are we merely automaton slaves to our underlying biology, or do we have the ability to act independently and free? A quagmire any relentless self-examining philosopher could get hung up on. And James was just that - relentless in self-examination. Indeed, his quest for the truth was epic. You can never go wrong reading anything he wrote. Always well-thought-out, clear and penetrating. This man illuminates everything he touches."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"It is said that William James influenced every great writer of his time, that his work had a deep influence on psychology and investigative thought in that area. What was to become a literary style without peer in the modern age was the style of stream of consciousness, the flow of words to represent the stream of thought - a style which originated in the work of William James. So when I approached the Varieties of Religious Experience I expected no less than a riveting and compelling study of human and individual experiences of the divine. I was not disappointed. However I did make the assumption that a book about human and religious experience would at least make a scant mention of scorpions and at the very least select crustaceans. When I had finished flicking through this tome to discover no scorpentine mentions whatsoever I really was disappointed - closed the book and snuffed my candle at once. Come on, James, what do you take us for? I have to say that this experience took away from my impression of what could have been an excellent book."},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"William James' masterwork is based on a series of lectures on &quot;natural religion&quot; that he delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 1901. He defined religion as &quot;the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.&quot; He is the great enunciator of the idea that all religions are equally valid and valuable, that since they can contain no animating truths, they should be measured merely by their effects on individuals. He is profoundly wrong.He is wrong in the way that all of the great artists of the Romantic period, from Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats to Picasso, are wrong, in his emphasis on the individual and his denial of the universal and the absolute. James offers a view of religion as a wholly personal matter, the utility of which lies in its benefits for each person. Like all of his intellectual cohorts, he had lost faith in universal truth. Indeed, one biographer has suggested that the succession of short term jobs that he held lead him to posit the equal value of all experiences. Because of this crisis of faith, he was unable to make judgments about the truth or value of different religious beliefs or ultimately to believe that any belief system had value beyond the effects on individual believers.The great challenge that confronts Western man is to reclaim the primacy of Judeo-Christianity from James and his ilk. Genesis, the Ten Commandments and the Gospels are not merely inspirational for individuals, taken together they express the aspirations of the species. Mankinds struggle to rise from the sheeplike state of Adam (before the fall) towards eventual Godhood, is the organizing story that has produced most of our greatest achievements. We should not surrender the centrality of these beliefs to the multiculturalists and moral relativists, no matter how gracefully they write.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature (Gifford lectures)","review":"I have a degree and some background in psychology, but I couldn't understand a word of what James Joyce was saying or trying to say, it's so &quot;thick&quot;, and that's unfortunately the way a lot of the top 100 greatest novels read for me; like Ulysses for example. That book was so thick with aulde Englishe, one would need an interpreter or something. My only thought is, what a bunch of stuffy people, those literary &quot;scholars&quot;, who voted many of these books. I am reading all the way through the bible, my objective, but I am also reading and enjoying many of the greatest classic novels as an objective, just to do it. But I don't need to read this book &quot;varieties..&quot; to gain a single grain of wisdom or whatever. I am a born-again God-Man with a most wonderful life experience. Handcuffed in a police car and at the breaking point, I silently cried out from someplace desperately deep inside, &quot;O God... Take me out of this world&quot;, and true to my prayer, God answered. One day hitchhiking, I met a household of &quot;brothers&quot; headed by a middle-aged Japanese couple. The Japanese man asked me, &quot;If you could have a treasure chest, that every time you opened it, there was something new and [exciting], would you take it?&quot; When I looked into his eyes, they were shining, not as if he had been weeping, but glistening as with life and joy. I didn't answer; in fact I put up a fighting argument the whole time, but I stepped out to the curb, and whispered, &quot;Lord Jesus Christ! If you are real, get me a ride.&quot; Almost instantly, a VW bug pulled over with a young college music student inside and took me home. Another day, I tested again, &quot;.. If you're real, please give me a ride.&quot; A car again pulled over, I got in without saying a word, and the lady handed me some christian gospel tracts, &quot;..Here. Hand these out to people you meet. Praise the Lord.&quot; Again another day, I tested, &quot;Lord, if you're real..&quot; I got in without saying a word, and the lady exclaimed, &quot;..I just had to pick you up. God told me, 'Pick up my Child'... &quot; After that, no more of those prayers, I just gave thanks and praise to God. My experience of salvation was very special, like nothing I had every thought or felt or [seen] before, and a &quot;brother&quot; in that same house I revisited didn't say a word. He just stood by my bedside [they let me rest on a bunkbed] enjoying and knowing the very same experience he had enjoyed. Everything I saw as black and white became a spectrum of color; and not just one spectrum of gold or silver, and the joy was just like a passage in the bible &quot;..a well of water springing up..&quot; I once repeated over and over &quot;Praise the Holy Spirit of God. Thanks and praise and honor and love to you O Spirit of God..&quot;; an incredible feeling slowly swept over me, starting at my head and moving all the way to the bottom of my feet, a feeling of powerful invincibility, like I was made of solid iron. I rushed out of the room to be with others; And many more remarkable experiences over the years, not all is fun and play; God has &quot;..many things to show you, but you are not yet ready or able.&quot; I went through many difficult times, as life just often is; I didn't say a word about God to anybody, not a word or gesture, but I was surprised when a lady stepped outside at work where I was standing and said, &quot;Oh Lord, you are so good, [and we can be so obstinate sometimes].&quot; I would rather read any of Watchman Nee's or Witness Lee's works than this boring book &quot;Varieties..&quot;; specifically , The Economy of God, a most important book, a classic masterpiece; I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have discovered it just once. Some of the principles set forth in that book can only be compared to something like the map to the treasure of Monte Cristo- a hundred fold. My only slight disagreement with Witness Lee is when he gets a little too preachy at times, maybe alluding to things of the spiritual life, &quot;.. the sisters just know [from the inner life], not to buy a certain thing.&quot; Sometimes, Mr. Lee may not have explained something as well as I think he should, but the book is a classic nonetheless. A greater read to me than &quot;Varieties..&quot; would be a compilation of born-again or life experiences; How about several volumes at least. &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; is an extremely boring read and I think a complete waste of time. Only one [thing] is important really, one focus, hinted at again and again thoughout the bible: Strive to enter [The Kingdom of God] at the strait gate. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are there already, Mary chose that better part, and few there be that find it.

Mel Rolfe is one author that has worked at filling that gap; LOOKING INTO HELL being his latest book on Bomber Command at war.The night battles waged by RAF bombers were equally as horrendous and costly as the day missions flown by USAAF crewmen. In one of the 20 stories Rolfe relates in this book -'Stretching Luck to the Limit' - he mentions that 35 crewmen reported to 102 Squadron in March 1941. Seven months later only one(!) was still alive.Rolfe has a nice writing style. You get to know each member of the crew involved in that particular mission and then follow them as they wing their way into Germany. First-person narratives abound in this book as pilots, air gunners, navigators, etc. relate how their shot-up Wellington struggled home on one engine, how they survived when their Lancaster disintegrated after a mid-air collision and the adventures of a shot-down crew adrift in the North Sea. The reminiscences are exciting, harrowing, and oft times sad as when the sole surviving member of a bomber relates the last flight of his aircraft.In short, this is a wonderful, poignant tribute to the brave men of Bomber Command."},{"Title":"Looking into Hell: Experiences of the Bomber Command War","review":"Looking Into Hell is a highly readable book about the crews of the RAF.

Rolfe writes exceptionally well about their adventures and incorporates the crews' oral history along with his own narrative. I found it quite readable.If you are not familiar with any of the RAF airplanes, I recommend viewing the aircraft via the internet to give you an idea of what they flew.

A closer look shows that it wasn't quite that simple. Certainly, the trains brushed aside the competition over medium and long distances, but there was still much work for horses to do at a local level, at least until motorized vehicles became available.The first chapter here covers the history of horse-drawn transport before the coming of locomotive-hauled trains. The remainder of the book explains the various ways in which horses remained useful in transporting people and freight well into the twentieth century. While focusing specifically on the area covered by the GWR, the basic story is likely to be fairly typical of Britain generally during the same period.The GWR employed horses on a variety of duties as this book clearly demonstrates. Unfortunately, this aspect of train operation has been largely ignored by authors, who have shown much greater interest in railway construction, architecture, locomotives and train operation, forgetting (or perhaps not realizing) that horses played an important role in the service of trains during the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. As such, the personal stories that employees might have been able to tell about their experiences are missing, but it seems that the archives contain plenty of official records (including pictures) to provide sufficient material for this book.Every aspect of train operation involving horses gets coverage, beginning with their employment in the construction of the railways. Even after their construction, the trains didn't go everywhere, so horse-drawn vehicles were required to transport people and freight to and from the trains. The GWR sometimes competed for this traffic by keeping their own fleet of road vehicles and horses to pull them, but they found other uses for horses too. Sometimes, horses were used instead of locomotives for shunting operations, while waste disposal and other light transport duties provided other tasks for horses. The book shows pictures of the little carts with the barrels used to contain the waste.Horse lovers may also appreciate the pages devoted to the GWR's care of their horses including their purchasing policies and stabling arrangements. Apparently, the GWR also held its own competitions to encourage employees to look after their horses well, knowing that horses work better if looked after properly.While much of this book is devoted to the service given by horses to trains, the GWR recognized that trains could sometimes provide a service for horses. Specially designed railway wagons (horseboxes) made their appearance in the 1840s. Apart from their usefulness in transporting the GWR's own horses, these horseboxes attracted other customers too. Racehorse transportation became a very important market for the GWR as this book explains, but the foxhunting and agricultural communities also appreciated these horseboxes.As trains became heavier and faster, locomotives gradually replaced horses for shunting duties, while motorized vehicles eventually replaced horses on other tasks. The book does not track these developments, but I know from other sources that horses were still employed in the service of trains until well into the 1950s, while the transportation of horses by train continued into the 1960s, when motorized horseboxes for use on the roads replaced the railway equivalents.Given the limited research material available, the author did a remarkable job in putting together this book, which covers a much neglected aspect of British industrial history."},{"Title":"Self-Fullness: The Art of Loving and Caring for Your Self","review":"&quot;Self-Fullness: The Art of Loving and Caring for your 'Self'&quot; takes the genre of the &quot;self-help&quot; book to an entirely new level.Though we are always told that we cannot fully love someone else without loving ourselves, &quot;Self-Fullness&quot; demonstrates this theory with practical self-evaluations and activities.Dr. Forman gives clear examples of how you can evaluate the situations in your own life and achieve the goal of what she terms &quot;self-fullness,&quot; which is really an enhanced all-around self-esteem.&quot;Self-Fullness&quot; isn't just for those who see problems in their life or seek therapy; it offers valuable tools for all of us to find ways to true inner satisfaction."},{"Title":"Would You?: Questions to Challenge Your Beliefs","review":"Many people who have been faced with moral temptation report that they are unprepared to deal with the issue. This sometimes means that they cannot decide, and in other cases makes it easier to choose the wrong way. Educators have found that by thinking about issues before we actually confront them, we are more likely to make good choices in a timely way. I found this book to be an excellent guide to that type of moral learning.The book is designed to take you into moral areas where you may not have to treat (but who knows what life will bring?). &quot;Most of the questions in this book you will never have to answer. (Unless your life is very interesting.)&quot;What follows are 250 questions in 125 pairs. &quot;We suggest you answer the first question in each pair before reading the second question.&quot; The reason for that instruction is because the first question is often a set-up for a more difficult question designed to help you see any potential hypocrisy (such as a double standard) in your reactions.For example, one opening question is: &quot;Would you be able to forgive your child anything at all?&quot; Now most parents will probably answer pretty liberally here. We are all familiar with the picture of the Mother crying at the execution of her son, the condemned murderer, protesting that he was a good person.Then, you get hit with the second question: &quot;Would you forgive your mate anything at all?&quot; From overhearing many people talk about that subject, most people have a long list of things they would not forgive a mate for.My assumption then is that you are supposed to think about why you would treat your mate differently from your child. Naturally, that might make sense of your child is still very young, with diminished capacity to hew to the straight and narrow. But what if your child is 40? Shouldn't the standard be similar, if not the same? Only you know what you would answer, but that is the sort of thinking that these questions will stimulate.The subject matters cover stealing, cheating, priorities for your life and society, preferences in family relations, relationship values, relationships to strangers, priorities for character traits, sexual attitudes, sex role attitudes, choices between self-interest and self-sacrifice, racial attitudes, life span versus quality of life issues, faithfulness, trust, law versus morality, and self-interest versus morality and legality.The questions are short and pretty simple. How you answer them is not so short and simple, especially after you see the second question. Leave yourself the option to go back and rethink your answer to the first question.I found the experience of reading this book and answering the questions to be a very valuable and rewarding one. I think you will, too.The only weakness in the book is that the design makes it unnecessarily hard to keep from seeing the second question too soon. You should keep an opaque piece of paper with you to cover the bottom of each page as you go. A better design would have been to have had the first question on a right hand page, and the second question on the following left hand page. That would have increased the cost of the book by making it longer, but it would have worked much better.I suspect that this would be a good book to discuss with other members of your family. You may be able to add even more moral muscle by thinking some of these questions through together. Certainly, you will understand each other better.Choose better and choose well!"},{"Title":"Would You?: Questions to Challenge Your Beliefs","review":"This book is a fabulous way to ease yourself into the entire &quot;If ...&quot; collection by Evelyn McFarlane. The questions aren't quite as &quot;open ended&quot;, so there isn't as much deliberation and/or internal insight required when reading it. But the questions are still great and provoke fabulous converstations between friends, loved ones, etc."},{"Title":"Would You?: Questions to Challenge Your Beliefs","review":"This book is easy to get right into. Everyone becomes interested with just the first question. It is also fun to guess what the other person may say before they give their answer. My husband and I went through the whole book the day I got it (and he is NOT a conversationalist). Definitely worth it to pick one up."},{"Title":"Would You?: Questions to Challenge Your Beliefs","review":"&quot;Would You?&quot; is a book in the &quot;If&quot; series and it has 250 questions that will challenge you to discover how much character you, or anyone else, actually has. The questions are thought provoking and some almost impossible to answer. This little book will force you to THINK in ways that test your values and beliefs. It is a great conversation opener as well as something to spend a few hours in deep contemplation over. It would be a great idea for the next presidental debate!"},{"Title":"Would You?: Questions to Challenge Your Beliefs","review":"This book helps is great for exploring the beliefs, values and ethics of others and ourselves. The 250 questions in Would You? are designed to generate answers that give us an insight about each others priorities and a better understanding of what they stand for.I really enjoyed considering my answers to questions such as, \\"Would you rather age well physically or mentally?\\" \\"Would you rather your child make you proud or show you great affection?\\" This book is a great tool that can be used to entertain friends and family. The structure of this book is similar to that of \\"How far will you go?\\" also written by Evelyn McFarlane and James Saywell with the difference in the choice provided with each question of whether you would do one thing over the other."},{"Title":"Would You?: Questions to Challenge Your Beliefs","review":"Great for sparking convo at parties and in groups. Semi-Socratic approach to figuring out where you and your firends stand on day to day issues!

Some of them as mexicans DO have higher rates of crimes and at the same time have higher rates of victimization by other mexicans because they have a subculture of violence that Chinese or Japanese, for example, dont have.Also you cannot say they are \\"victims\\" of discrimination when you cannot blame the rest for noticing the obvious, that they are people who come from different ancestry sticking to their own culture; They are only experiencing what is natural when you are an outsider living in a different culture. the host population doesn't obliges any minority to enter they societies and is not responsible for their ethnic, values, abilities and lifestyle differences, if they enter to a new society even with that on account is because they a getting a benefit and not being \\"victimized\\" and we can see that their crime rates instead of being caused by their minority situation are less than the ones of their origin countries.if you want some politically correct rationalization of crime based on mental gymnastics this is the book for you but if you want to see the real face of crime look somewhere else."},{"Title":"So Many Men... (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Like the first book, this book was a great story. I can't wait to read the third book. I'm sure I won't be able to put that one down either."},{"Title":"So Many Men... (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Sex with Tess McClellan is the best experience of Mason Davies' life. He's never met anyone so passionate, so giving. Their time together has a magical touch and he hasn't felt this good in years.Problem is, all her former lovers apparently feel the same way. Every time Mason turns around, he's stumbling over another old flame. It's enough to give a guy a complex - even with all her assurances that those men are just friends. If Mason wasn't so captivated by Tess, he'd walk away.Since leaving is not an option, he's decided to convince her to drop the entourage. With a few sexy moves and some seductive persuasion, he'll prove he's the only man she needs.[2nd in the Sexual Healing series]"},{"Title":"Red Odyssey : A Journey Through the Soviet Republics","review":"Marat Akchurin &#65533; an Uzbek poet and man of letters - set off on a tour of the Central Asian republics, just as the Soviet Union was crumbling into extinction. This is the travelog of his journey through states and countries that were being thrown into turmoil. It&#65533;s fascinating, partly because he&#65533;s an Uzbek and therefore able to go to places where westerners can&#65533;t, and partly because he went there just at the time the split was getting into full swing.Even in those days, the Central Asia republics weren&#65533;t particularly happy places. Ethnic cleansing in Uzbekistan & Kirghistan rivalled anything we&#65533;ve seen in recent years in the former Yugoslavia. Destitution was rife as the final death throws of central planning removed any regularity and certainty from life. And the withdrawal of Soviet troops meant that gangs, mafia and warlord factions were rife. Akturin had a number of lucky escapes from mafioso along the way.His travels also take the reader thorough the fascinating old Moghul/Silk Road cities of Alma-Ata (now Almaty), Samarkand and Tashkent. You&#65533;d be hard pressed to describe them as either glamorous or affluent these days. He finally ends up in Baku, a former naval base for the Imperial Russian navy, and the place where Russian agents used to set off on their journey&#65533;s across the steppes to fight their covert war against the British Raj.The style is free flowing and extremely readable. He may be a poet, but this is factual travel writing with an eye for fascinating detail. The translator has done a fine job in bringing Red Odyssey to an English speaking audience. The maps of his travels are also very good. Four stars."},{"Title":"They Dared to be Different, Revised Edition","review":"I grew up among the Tzotzil people and this book gave me insights to things that I never realized were around and to things that I took for granted. A wonderful book for anyone where ever you are in your Christian walk."},{"Title":"Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History of the Self","review":"Much of Dr. Anthony Stevens' life work has been attempting to connect Jung's theory with the achievements of modern biology, psychology, and sociology and showing the relevance of Jung's ideas to modern science.In Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History of the Self Dr. Stevens succeeds in doing just that. The main premise of the book is that Carl Jung was well ahead of his time, and that Jungian theory, in author's opinion, has been, for the most part, validated by scientific research in the last forty years.The ideas presented in the book are complex, but their understanding is made easy by Dr. Stevens' impeccable style and clearly presented arguments. In the best Jungian tradition, the author is not shying away from applying theoretical considerations to contemporary mores, which makes for valuable practical lessons, as well as welcome and refreshing commentaries.It may well happen that this and other books of Dr. Stevens (most notably Evolutionary Psychiatry written with John Price) will be viewed ultimately as what brought Jungian theory out of relative obscurity and into the mainstream of psychology and biological science.I found this book very interesting and useful for understanding the key ideas, practical implications, and contemporary scientific proof of Jungian psychology. I highly recommend this book to anyone (especially someone with medical or biological background) interested in Carl Jung and his theory."},{"Title":"Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History of the Self","review":"Fabulous! \\"The findings of the two new disciplines, evolutionary psychology and evolutionary psychiatry, in no way contradict or supersede Jung's original insights into the nature and influence of the archetypes which make up the human collective unconscious. On the contrary, they corroborate and amplify them. They confirm that human experience and human behavior are complex products of environmental and hereditary forces . . . . What evolutionary psychology is studying is the psychic unity of humankind. This is not, as some critics have suggested, a reductive universalism but an attempt to establish those psychic structures and functions, those strategies and goals, which we all have in common by virtue of our humanity. Far from diminishing our uniqueness as individuals and rendering us prisoners of our genes, this perspective enables us to celebrate with deeper appreciation the ways in which people living in widely different environmental circumstances work out variations of great complexity on similar sets of archetypal themes . . . . In the presence of pervasive cultural uncertainty, it becomes a matter of urgency to understand the basic archetypal needs and resources of humankind.\\""},{"Title":"Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History of the Self","review":"Insightfully written by Anthony Stevens (a Jungian analyst, and psychiatrist of 30 years' experience), Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History Of The Self is now in a greatly expanded and updated edition. Dr. Stevens provides Jungian students and scholars with a thorough exploration and stimulating study of the connections between archetypes of the fields of ethology and sociobiology, while addressing archetypes in practice such as the family, the mother, the father, masculine and feminine images and more. Archetype Revisited is a worthy and welcome contribution to Jungian Studies reading lists and reference collections."},{"Title":"Archetype Revisited: An Updated Natural History of the Self","review":"I've followed the literature of Jungian psychology for over 30 years and believe without a doubt that this is one of best books I've read. Stevens \\"de-mystifies\\" the concepts of archetypes and of the collective unconscious and grounds them in biology and evolutionary psychology. He not only explains what archetypes are, but more importantly he describes the implications they have in our daily lives. His writing, while scholarly, is extraordinarily readable -- frankly I found all his books to be page turners!! -- and he brings clarity and insight to a sometimes convoluted field. This is an excellent book for readers both new to the field and familiar with the subject."},{"Title":"Acting in Believing.","review":"This was our assigned text in beginning acting. I was first skeptical about how much one could learn about from a book. The answer is, \\"quite a bit.\\" The book, in spite of its slim appearance, holds a good amount of information and is packed with acting exercises. All in all, a good supplement to anyone's shelf."},{"Title":"Acting in Believing.","review":"The book is a good read so far. I got in just in time for class. I ordered it late.

These people really try hard to make the customer happy."},{"Title":"Nonviolence in America: A Documentary History","review":"I was required to buy this for a terrible class I took in law school. It is a left wing propaganda book. If you voted for Ralph Nader and think that Howard Zinn is a proper historian, you will love this book.

The opening line of the opening story in Aaron&#65533;s Intifada: &#65533;You need to leave your mind alone.&#65533; What would the shade of an African-American martyr to the American Revolution be thinking as he rides the Boston subway? Can a man with incessant noise in his head hear the sound of Truth? Intelligent plotting, richly offbeat characterization, elegant pacing, a knowing laugh here and there, are prevailing features of a Ken Goldstein story. Nice for his readers, isn&#65533;t it? Ken Goldstein can&#65533;t leave his mind alone."},{"Title":"Aaron's Intifada: And Other Short Stories","review":"Ken Goldstein's debut anthology of short stories, Aaron's Intifada And Other Short Stories offers the reader a diverse collection of memorable characters who must face challenge, hope, loss, and the path to personal redemption. Some are confronted by violence; others find a way to create beauty when pressed upon by despair. Aaron's Intifada And Other Short Stories is strongly recommended as a impressive and engaging anthology that reflects Goldstein's skillfully original storytelling talent."},{"Title":"Aaron's Intifada: And Other Short Stories","review":"Ken Goldstein is quite a creative story teller, with the ability to take us by surprise in each piece. The variety of subject matter and settings make Aaron's Intifada far from boring!

Thoughtful and funny and filled with Linda Goodman's unique humor, it walks you through your possible combinations and pitfalls. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I remember this book from when I was a little girl and my mom bought it home. I just remember liking the cover. Then as I got older and began to like to read, I discovered what was inside that cover and the rest was history. I love it. It was a great read from start to finish. Over the years every member of our house has consulted it to plunder its wisdom. I don't know much about astrology but the writing is what keeps me coming back for more. I love it's whimsical spirit and whisdom. The bits of poetry are wonderful and inspiring. Of a rainy evening you could do worst than to sit down with this one. There are no boring parts. You will enjoy reading about every sign and combination trying to glimps discriptions of yourself or people you know. I just dont have a bad thing to say about this book except that is too short. I wish there were more signs in the zodiac just to read what Linda Goodman has to say about them.Her other books are good but this one is definately the keeper of them all."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE THE BEST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ ON ASTROLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS. IF I HAD READ THIS BOOK EARLIER, I WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH A 30 YEAR MARRIAGE TO THE WRONG LOVE SIGN. I NOW READ IT BEFORE I GO OUT ON A DATE AND I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE ON TARGET ALWAYS. I HAVE GIVEN SIX GIFTS OF THIS BOOK TO PEOPLE I RESPECT AND I HAVE JUST ORDERED ANOTHER FIVE BOOKS FOR FRIENDS TODAY!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"A friend told me she was an air sign (Libra) and I was probably a fire sign. This sent me off to the bookstore to pour through astrology books. I too am an air sign (Gemini) after all. The number of books on the subject was overwhelming, but Goodman's books were the most succinct and the only ones where humor played a part. I am a Christian and usually stay away from this stuff, but her insights are accurate and helped me to see myself and others so clearly, I had to buy Love Signs. Now I am going back for Sun Signs and her new book. I wouldn't base my life on this, but it is always helpful to have insight into people, especially ourselves. Love Signs is entertaining, has a ton of information, and covers every possible combination of relationships. I especially like the fact she covers basic relationships and not only romantic ones. If I were to buy one book on astrology, this would be the one!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"This book is very comprehensive regarding general pairing of astrological signs. However, despite its stout appearance, it really just skims the surface of true astrological insight."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I love everything about this book -- the extra charts she provided, the wonderful stories, the positive attitude -- but especially the compassion Linda Goodman projects to every reader with every word she's written. (Being a Pisces, I am impressed by this quality most of all!) When I meet new people, I check out the descriptions of their signs and they are 9 times out of 10 dead-on accurate. (Usually, I've got my birth dates mixed up if it's wrong!) I've read Sun Signs (also a great book), but this is my dog-eared and beloved bible -- buy it today!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I discovered Linda's Sun Signs first. I read it and was completely amazed by its content. Up until that time I had been a complete skeptic. I then discovered Love Signs and it probably has been the most helpful book I have read on the subject of relationships. She is such a great writer and truly has a gift. I have given her book to all of my friends, and they still thank me for it. Do yourself a favor, buy the book, read the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"A book for anyone who has relationships with others--in short, all of us. Linda Goodman, in her usual delightful writing, paints clear and certain pictures of each Sign's relationship, love or otherwise, with each other sign. Ms. Goodman, from a dedicated Leo, I have to say I liked the Leo parts best. (The rest was good too!)This book belongs in any library or treasury of reference books, astrology books, or books for you and your loved one."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I gave this such a low rating bcause of tthe terrible formatting on kindle. Half the words missing in places. I would give it much higher for paperback but unfortunately I purchased it on kindle."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Linda Goodman was as good as it gets when it came to nailing personality types through astrology. She never tried to give us lottery numbers or tell us what kind of a day we were going to have. But if you want to know what makes that Gemini so elusive or why Virgos are anal-retentive perfectionists, then this is the book for you. She also gives some sage advice on the topics of how earth and fire, or any combination of the elements, will combine. If you are into astrology, you know what I mean; if not, buy the book and be enlightened.Her language is a little Age of Aquarius for many people today, but it is definitely worth looking into just to see what makes us tick. Don't be surprised if you think she is talking directly to you, about you or someone you know. I did. She knows me and my wife like a book."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Incredibly witty and clever, very fun to read.

Came before the estimated date and this was also a nice surprise. Recommendations for the seller.Book itself is an excellent guide for the signs. Mrs. Goodman so detailed and lively describes each sign with a perfect accuracy. We are all determined by our sign and, whether or not we admit, we are exactly how it is written in the book. With this personal approach, in the funny way she is explaining some life situations, which makes this book even more interesting to read."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"No other astrologer will ever surpass Linda Goodman.

It lasts a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"When I was a young graduate student it began to occur to me that most of the girls that I dated were Scorpios--while I was a Capricorn. Somehow I stumbled upon this book during this time in my life. After reading the sections on relationships between Scorpios and Capricorns I was too fascinated by this book to put it down. Perhaps at the time I was simply delusional, but some of the things in this book seemed valid. Interestingly, I found my way out of the cycle of dating Scorpios and married an Ares."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Linda Goodman was the best writer astrology has ever had, period. Sure she only reviewed general sun sign compatiblity and yes there is much, much, much more to compatiblity by the stars. Despite only being general its quite accurate and one of the best reads you will find. I'm sick of people saying she was a hack or fake astrologer, the woman's heroes were Sydney Omarr, Grant Lewi, and Alan Leo 3 of the best astrolgers of the 20th century and I'm sure she tried to immulate them in her actual profession."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"...because only Scorpio fits with how I love. All those things I mentioned in my title are in Scorpio and the 12th House in my natal chart.However, I'm also a Libra Sun, so the Scorpio's kind of tempered -- but not by much. This book proves that. It also proves that one should have their own natal chart done and *then* dig in!I love Linda Goodman's books, across the board. This one's no different -- but I've also had my own copy since 1998. Her books are not only informative, but entertaining to read.She was one great lady. Sorely missed."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I read a portion of this book in a book store and started crying at the accuracy. I felt as if Linda Goodman knew me and was talking to me as a close friend. I love this book. Even on signs that are not supposed to be compatible she brings up more of the good than the bad, and how every combination can find a way to make things work. I LOVE this book!! I would recommend this to any one interested in astrology and those looking for ways to get insights about their partner."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. It's the third one I've owned in my lifetime. It very informational. No matter how many times I read it, I always learn something new.

It is dead on about many aspects of relationships between the signs and sexes. Linda Goodman borrow little from other astrological writers of her time, instead she did most of the research herself - giving her work uniqueness and integrity.However, she wrote this book a long time ago, and many of the cultural issues surrounding the time period such as women's lib and the application and social requirement of prescribed sex roles color her explanations and insights. This gives her book an out-dated feel and can be very frustrating to for today's women to read for such reasons as her tendency to warn men that there women might be just as good at business as they are.I wish someone would follow up Ms. Goodman's research with current, if any, cultural issues."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"As an Astrology buff for many years, with @ least 20 books, three are my favorites & this one is one.

Linda Goodman possessed an uncanny knack of expressing the pure gist of the various signs weaving poetic metaphor with articulate character descriptions. Her books have changed my life and to this day have granted me deeper perspectives into the nuances of the human psyche and human heart. Timeless wisdom that never bores nor tires, a must have."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Not only is this book an excellent reference tool for astrology enthusiasts, but it's for anyone whose ever fallen in love; Goodman's writing style is fluid, creative, and beatiful.

Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Love Signs is truly an awesome book. Its content doesnt simply entertain and inform the adult population. I used to take this book to school to read on the long bus ride to and from and everyone on the bus involved in a relationship wanted to know. These aren't wild, vague guesses at your personality or compatability but time proven astrology.

I refer to it so often that I wore mine out and had to buy a replacement.

Want to know a probability of level of compatibility with all the details?

Love rereading it again."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"This book doesn't accurately explain Sun Signs. It does for a general view, yes, but when it comes to people, you really need to make a birth chart for them, interpret each, and then synastry - it's all in the details! On the other hand, I will give credit for being fabulously funny, witty and romantic. It really did fuel my interest in astrology, and bettered my understanding by giving examples of the character of each sign as human beings, along with the season they prefer and the body part they affect."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Always insightful, well-written, and spot-on.

I refer to it when wanting to know how different star signs mix. It is so thorough that there are at least a few pages for each combination (eg. Aries and Leo who are not romatically involved; Aries Man, Leo Woman; Leo Man, Aries Woman). I would thoroughly recommend it, and if you only buy one astrology book in your whole lifetime, make sure this is it. It is very comprehensive (over 1000 pages long) though it deals of course only with sun signs and doesn't go into great detail about the other planets but Linda does mention how other planetary configurations can affect a relationship."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I love this book and so did the friend that borrowed it from me a couple of years ago, this is why I had to purchase another one.

Linda Goodman shows a lot of herself on the many pages, funny,genuine,loving, but that's an Aries for you."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Linda Goodman was a very eccentric woman, but very loving and humane. And she was a fantastic writer who could write as if she was your best friend and somehow knew you intimately. This book is meant to show people how the different zodiac signs relate to each other. Linda chose to use the Sun sign influence because it's the most prominent one in a person's birth chart. But Linda stresses that it's very important to know a person's whole birthchart, especially the Moon, Venus and Mars placements. For example, Mars has much to do with a person's sexual nature. A Taurus person with Mars in Scorpio will be much more sexual and less inclined toward cerebral pursuits than a Taurean with Mars in Aquarius. I feel that Linda's spiritual perspective is what makes her books very interesting. She puts astrology into its proper spiritual perspective as nobody else has ever been able to do. Also, Linda stressed that anybody can love anybody else, no matter what their Sun sign is. However, Earth signs will definitely get along better with fellow Earth signs than with Fire signs, for example, and Linda explains things like this real well. The book should be used as a guide for tolerance and understanding of others. It should not guide whether or not you dump someone. Maybe you're an Aries person and the other is a Cancer. A probable no-go? But if the Cancer person has many planets in Gemini and Leo, they could be your soul mate. As Linda wrote, learn the other person's entire birth chart. This stuff should be taught in school."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Linda Goodman's Love Signs has been a classic in the field for decades, and for very good reason. Her material is very helpful in guiding you through the maze of relationships and relationship building. Reading about the different signs and their compatibilities can help you not only when you have fallen in love or met someone &quot;interesting&quot;, but it can also help when you are having problems or if you are trying to formulate what we know in the metaphysical field as a &quot;wish list&quot;. When you learn more about the different signs and their capabilities and drawbacks in love, you will be able to refine your own taste and expectations. If you are a beginner at love, you may not even realize that there are as many different ways to court and express love as there are signs (12). Do you know what you are looking for? Maybe there's something you want that you didn't even dare dream of. Look in this book ... you may find it in one of the signs. I recommend ordering this book today and keeping it by your bedside! (There is also no better way to learn beginning astrology as with Linda Goodman.)"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"This book teaches so much more than the dynamics of relationships. In the same way we learn about ourselves through our interactions with others so can we learn about the sun signs by their relation to the other signs. Also, personal perception affects much of horoscope interpretation and Linda Goodman's Love Signs accounts for this in a way more books don't; indeed, the book transforms it to the readers' advantage."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I have owned this book for 12 years. Both my daughters have used this book and most of my girlfriends. This publication has given me the best insight to people in my life and how and why they are like they are. I have in many occasions called this book,\\"My People Bible\\". When I meet someone new, female or male, co-worker, special person in my life or whatever I always ask when their Birthday is. I then refer back to my \\"bible\\" to see how I interact with that sign. I was so very sad when Linda Goodman passed away. It was like a death in my family. I recommend this book to anyone who really wants to make relationships work."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"This book is wonderful if you are looking for the deeper implications of relations between different signs. Instead of just &quot;this will work, that won't work&quot; standard one would get from any other work, this goes beneath the surface. The thoroughness is what impressed me the most, as well as looking at relationships from both sexes' point of view. Quite informative and expertly written."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I've had this book for years and it's the only one that I go back to at least once a month. It is well worn and proud of it. I cannot live without it. Linda Goodman tell us what differences you might encounter and how to make the most of it. I feel truly lucky that I found this book. Nothing, and I mean nothing compares to this book. You will not regret getting this one."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"This book is not just a beautiful book on astrology. It is a beautiful book. Goodman analyzes every astrological combination with love and care. She doesn't feel that a relationship will/will not work. She plays more like romance therapist, coaching each sign to work through and appreciate the other's ideosyncrasies. She explains why we're attracted to our opposites as naturally as those who seem to be cut from the same cloth as ourselves. After dozens of cookie-cutter horoscopes, Goodman stands out as the only rational, informed astrologer. Whenever someone can't understand why I believe in Astrology, I let them borrow Love Signs. It will make a believer out of anyone."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Searching for a dictionary a few years ago on my father's bookshelf, I came across this book instead. It was serendipitous the moment I opened the book. The version I have was published in 1978, and yet, all of her sign analyses have withstood the test of time. Goodman provides the reader with such detailed and accurate information about each sign, you'll feel as though she were there with you in person providing a personal astrological/psychic reading. This extends, in particular, to her interpretaion of the compatibility between each sign. This book helps to explain those things about your personality and love life which you always wanted to know. It is an absolute must have for those who believe in astrology. And, for those non-believers and skeptics, I guarantee this book will change your mind. I do, however, have one critical statement to make about this book. Throughout the text, Goodman refers to Sun sign numbers, ascendent and descendent influences. Her explanation of these concepts, which appear in the appendix, fall short of providing the reader with a thorough understanding. Perhaps a more updated publication of this book has expounded on the aforementioned concepts, in which case my critique will thereby be moot. Nevertheless, Linda Goodman's Love Signs will help you to better understand yourself, friends, lovers, and mates. This is a book that you can pass down for generations to come.Ciao Bella!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"As you can gather from the book's title, LINDA GOODMAN'S LOVE SIGNS describes the typical relationship for each combination of Sun signs. It doesn't delve into the intricacies of entire birth charts, but neither do most romantically oriented astrology books, and the ones that do are drastically shorter than this 900-plus-page tome. Mentions of Moon and ascendant placements are frequent throughout the book, so they are indeed taken into account, but this book will not help you find them. You will need to know your and your lover's Moon, Venus, and Mars placements to get a more complete understanding ofyour compatibility.Before cracking this weighty volume open, you need to know that Goodman employed a writing style that would probably be considered hokey if someone used it today. As befits the passionate, idealistic nature of Aries, Goodman's writing--in all her work, but especially in this book--frequently reads like \\"a New Age Bobby Goldsboro song,\\" as one third party put it.Perhaps you don't care about that, however, and simply want to ascertain some idea of this guide's usefulness. Unlike some romantic astrology books that try to dissuade the reader from starting a relationship with a member of a conflicting Sun sign, Goodman asserts that any pairing can be compatible; the two halves only need to undertake more work to understand each other. This interpretation is quite refreshing, and an approach that more occult books would do well to follow.Unfortunately, the guiding flaw of this book needs to be addressed, particularly because it colors the advice this book gives and has gone unmentioned in the other reviews. LOVE SIGNS falls prey to one of the most persistent bugaboos of astrology books: gender binarism. Linda Goodman's Sun Signs set a precedent for this; the worst of it occurred in the \\"Taurus Man\\" and \\"Pisces Woman\\" sections. I can forgive this book for concentrating exclusively on heterosexual relationships, since the author was a heterosexual writing in the 1970s and probably did not believe that she was qualified to discuss homosexual relationships in any detail, but today's occultist in love may not find her views of men and women relevant. The gender binarism sometimes combines with the sentimental writing style to produce passages such as this, from the \\"Aries Woman/Aries Man\\" section:\\"[R]eally now, dear Aries girl, when you're honest with yourself, would it all have been quite so magical if the fiery courageous Princess had come charging bravely into the woods on her horse to claim her Prince and rescue him from the Wicked Witch? ...Imagine dainty Cinderella, red-faced, puffing and perspiring, as she tried to shove a glass Hush-Puppy on her Prince's foot, to see if it fitted him. Mother Nature knows what she's doing. The Aries man-woman relationship will stand a better chance of success if she permits him to steal her Mars thunder\\" (44-45).\\"Fiery, courageous\\" heroines are common in folklore: consider, for instance, the Goose Girl, Kate Crackernuts, Marjorie in \\"The Juniper Tree,\\" and, of course, Gretel, who saved Hansel from the wicked witch who intended to eat him. But maybe they're simply \\"astrologically uninitiated\\" for failing to realize that they can only participate in the best kind of romantic relationship if they need princes to rescue them. Similarly cringe-inducing passages occur in other sections: \\"Capricorn Man/Pisces Woman\\" contains and makes no effort to criticize Muhammad Ali's infamous rant about keeping his wife at home; \\"Aries Man/Pisces Woman\\" implies that \\"Mother Nature smiles\\" at a man who ensures that his wife is \\"barefoot in the winter and pregnant in the summer;\\" \\"Leo Woman/Leo Man\\" approves of the literal interpretation of the ending of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW, which is that an aggressive woman needs a man to dominate her; \\"Leo Woman/Pisces Man\\" encourages the man to rise above himself (or sink below himself, depending on your perspective) and \\"put [his woman] in her place\\" but gives completely different instructions to the Pisces woman who loves a Leo man--treat him as if he were a king and you were his loyal subject. If you're a fierce fighting woman who loves a nurturing, timid man or a nurturing, timid man who loves a fierce fighting woman, then this is not the astrology book for you.Not to misrepresent LOVE SIGNS, Goodman's advice is useful, and her analyses are accurate. Furthermore, LOVE SIGNS is an interesting work; it is over nine hundred pages long, but never becomes boring. How many books can make that boast? In this case, the writing style helps; Goodman likes to use concrete details and imagery in her work, so the result is less like a cookbook of abstractions and more like a collection of spiritual short stories. Moreover, Goodman expresses feminist sympathies that clash with the \\"man of steel, woman of Kleenex\\" tone that blights other sections of the book. She frequently expresses support for the ERA, and in \\"Libra Man/Libra Woman,\\" she writes, \\"Male chauvinism is just so uncoordinated...so unpoetic\\" (655). This book is a tough act for today's occultists to follow, and someone needs to write an astrology book about same-sex relationships that goes into as much detail as LOVE SIGNS.Above all, the word that describes LOVE SIGNS best is \\"dichotomous.\\" According to this book, characteristics are either masculine or feminine, and what characteristics are which depends on the way they have been viewed traditionally. Thus, in LOVE SIGNS, dominance, power, determination, and obstinance are masculine; submission, gentleness, passivity, dependence, and receptiveness are feminine. In other words, the liberated Aries woman and aggressive Aries man are so because they are \\"masculine;\\" the submissive Pisces woman and meek Pisces man are so because they are \\"feminine.\\" This mindset produces a book that promotes both gender polarization and the women's rights movement, all while providing insight into archetypes of human personality. But it's never boring!"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I guess nearly every astrology student is aware of this text -a worthy follow up to her &quot;Sun Signs&quot; It's been loved and treasured as well as teased. Linda Goodman writes with passionate conviction about all of the astrological combinations and this book indeed appears a labour of love. She explains the harmony/disharmony that commonly exist between the different sign elements and modes and what each sign is here to learn and can best teach. The literary quote before each analysis is delightful. Eg: Cancer/Pisces: &quot;Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound, at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world - the mermaids talking to the moon.&quot; It is not as clinically scientific as many texts but the author is irresistably enthusiastic about her subject. Don't expect total accuracy - the book is general. Some statements are contentious. Eg: She says that Aquarians and Pisceans have much in common and are good for each other. Astrologer Teri King was far less enthusiastic about this combination saying that a cool, detached Aquarian is not a good mate for the emotional and sentimental fish. Either writer could be write depending on the specific planetary emphases in each subjects chart. I hope this book encourages budding astrologers to keep delving into this beautiful and mysterious science. Anything by Liz Greene could be a next best step."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"I have read many, many horoscope books.

I enjoy reading the chapters of this book over and over again. This book covers all the combinations of men and women of each sign in relationships. There are the 2 sections of romantic relationships (for example one part would be on the male virgo dating a female capricorn, and the other part of the same chapter would be the opposite: the male capricorn and female virgo dating relationship) and 1 on a general, not necessarily romantic, relationship between people of those 2 signs.

I totally beg to differ. This book is much bigger than &quot;Sun Signs&quot; but ironically not as useful. The size of the book is a result of what the author has to say about each pairing of the signs, male and female. It does not tell you whether they are compatible or not, but only gives you the plus and negative sides and let you decide. Well, if that is the case, why bother even pairing the signs? I can be the judge after reading the sign of my potential partner in &quot;Sun Signs&quot; and then I'll decide whether she is right for me or not.

I give Linda Goodman VERY much credit for being a wonderful business woman and for her marketing efforts which are what made her so popular. Plus, she somehow got ahold of the work done by Cheiro and copied it in her book and used his knowledge of numerology to further her advancement for popularity.

However if you are poor and unwanted then you are \\"mentally disturbed\\" if you act a little strange. I personally think this book is 5 pounds of horse manure packed loosely into a 10 pound bag and am of the opinion that Ms.Goodman could have greatly benefited from some Serious Heavy Duty Medication and Therapy..

It my first glimpse into traditional astrology, and as such, it was useful for its time, as a first glimpse into astrological \\"types\\" (or stereotypes).However, as I continued to delve into astrology and my understanding of it increased, I increasingly found it wanting. First, Goodman's characterization of the astrological types is by necessity highly stereotyped. The reason people are so complex is because they are more than their individual sun signs; the signs for the moon and ascendant, for example, are just as influential regarding how people respond emotionally-- not to mention the romance and sex planets, Mars and Venus, which are very important for this kind of a book! Of course, one cannot blame Goodman for her stereotyping, as she could not consider all these aspects in a book that only deals with the basics. However, and this is the second point, even allowing it to be so, I still find her characterization of the signs overtly simplistic, sometimes slipping into something that appears a little superficial, even silly.Goodman's book is in fact a superficial skimming over how all the signs interact, and probably did not require all the text she used in describing the relationships, especially as much of it is her own interpretation, which is sometimes, as I said, just too superficial.This book will introduce you to all the stereotypes you wish to entertain about the signs and how they interact; but really, not to much more."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Linda Goodman's best book is her synastry book Relationship Signs. That book does tend to be accurate. The problem with this book here is that it is based on a lot of ideas in astrology that sadly do not pan out. You are not mostly like to marry people who are the same element as you. That is true for the fire signs, however, those marriages do not always last. This kind of relationship astrology proves to be the most difficult because compatibility actually depends on the ruling planets and not the elements. The meaning behind peoples relationships deals with an understanding of astrology that is deeply esoteric; you really have to understand your planets.The problem here is that relationship compatibility is actually a kind of astrology that tests. The results are not as romantic as Goodman would have it. You are most likely to marry and stay married to another person that is your same sun sign. The reason for this is because people believe that the way that they are is the way that everyone should be. It is a kind of narcissism that everyone possesses and it is sad, in my opinion. That being the case everyone is most likely to marry someone of the same sun sign excluding Leo; Leo wants to be the one and only.Another possibility for why you do mess with someone who is the same element as you is because you are doing a kind of same sign reception. If I am a Taurus that loves Virgos it is because I am a Taurus that was born under the Virgo decadent of Taurus so 11-20 degrees of Taurus. My Virgo lover may also be born under the Taurus decadent of Virgo 21-30 degrees Virgo. We are therefore ruled by the same planets. By decadent I am a Mercury ruled Taurus and he would be a Venus ruled Virgo. Goodman does not explain this.This is the real reason behind a lot of fatal attractions evolving people of the same element. We are looking at receptions.The truth behind this stuff is really complicated. Other factors in the chart can also mess around with how you are going to relate. You need to read The Astrology File: Scientific Proof of the Link Between Star Signs and Human Behavior by Gunter Sachs and When Stars Collide by Paul Western.A lot of what Goodman claims here is true, but it shouldn't be your bible. It is also based on a lot of astrological ideas about elemental compatibility that end up being dead wrong. An example would be that Aquarius and Gemini split up frequently because neither signs are possessive enough to make the relationship last. Do they get along yes. It is a match made in heaven, no. There are a whole lot of these little astrological corks in astrology and you wouldn't learn them reading this book."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"Seller shipped book fast and safe!

If you know your ascendent it helps.Love Signs is a great follow up to Linda Goodman's Sun Signs. Sun Signs was like a Bible for a lot of us girls in high school in the 70's and the books still hold true to the astrological personalities today. There are few astrologists that can match Linda's work. She was the best. What a loss that we don't have her with us anymore."},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Love signs: A new approach to the human heart","review":"In her first book sun signs Linda spoke of each sunsign . in this book she deals with the relationships between people of different(or same signs) .Through simple language(there s little mention of trines, squares etc.)she deals with all the questions you want answered . all you have to do is look up your sun sign in the convenient table provided and then along with the sign of the person you want to consider , you look up the respective chapter( this book covers every combination).

A manager, Trish borrows an operator's number for her tickets, meaning Emma Bailey will get credit for her calls. The frantic pace of the night and her inexperience lead to a mistake.Trish overhears part of a call to Hawaii, and the man placing the call believes that she has heard too much. The following day an orchid arrives with a commendation for the operator handling the Hawaii call. When her shift ends, a car runs down Emma, killing her. Police believe it was kids joyriding. Trish suspects murder.No one believes Trish's story regarding the Hawaii call and its link to Emma's death. Driven by guilt, Trish begins her own investigation. Research links the call to a phone booth near an old mansion that has been subdivided into apartments. A convenient vacancy allows Trish to move in so she can watch the tenants and track a killer. Events soon escalate, however, leaving Trish isolated and unable to trust anyone.Readers who remember the movie Sorry, Wrong Number will recognize a chillingly similar theme in NUMBER, PLEASE, by Sheree Petree. When no one takes her suspicions seriously but the killer, Trish struggles with whom she can trust. As danger closes in, tension runs high. Only when she enlists the help of others will she be able to solve the crime. Petree writes in a compelling style, making NUMBER, PLEASE impossible to put down. A richly developed mystery, NUMBER, PLEASE comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Number, Please (Telephone Company Mystery)","review":"In 1965 Santa Cruz, California during the worst storm of the season, Trish Malcolm, a less than three-week management hire by Ma Bell, is forced to work the switchboard, devices she knows nothing about. Inadvertently, she accidentally overhears a part of a pay phone conversation placed by someone named Jay Jay. The next night a telephone operator is run down in the parking lot and Trish believes it was no accident but a killer gunning for her.She locates the street where the phone call was placed and sees only one building in the vicinity. There's a sign in the window saying there's a room for rent and Trish decides to take it thinking she can find the killer. During the course of her investigation, somebody shoots at her, kills a tenant living in the building and set fire to the place. Only when she comes out in the open and enlists the help of her co-workers does she have a chance of exposing the killer.Sheree Petree has written a very clever amateur sleuth novel that captures the ambiance of the 1960's America. The heroine is an admirable and determined young woman who acts according to her own convictions, not caring if everyone thinks she's a fool though taking matters in her own hand as opposed the police seems today as foolish, but remember the time and generation involved. The mystery is so well constructed that readers won't guess who the killer is until the author chooses to reveal him.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Number, Please (Telephone Company Mystery)","review":"A very well written book and a definite page turner. Ms. Petree makes one feel like they are are part of Santa Cruz and \\"Ma Bell\\" in the 1960's.

I can't wait for Sheree Petree's next book!!!"},{"Title":"Number, Please (Telephone Company Mystery)","review":"and a cup of tea on a rainy afternoon and you won't be disapointed. Number, Please is a fun, engaging read from the fresh, unique setting (the phone company in the 1960s) to the multiple cast of characters, that amazingly do not overwhelm the reader with too large of a cast while still giving a three-dimensional view of each character. The tension is built slowly and with a few surprising twists that kept this mystery buff reader entertained and not quite sure who did it until the very end. I look forward to more novels from this author."},{"Title":"Number, Please (Telephone Company Mystery)","review":"The phone company in Santa Cruz in the sixties might seem like an unlikely venue for a mystery, but it's one of the best things about this book. The side commentary on the lives of working women is there without being heavy handed. The mystery plot was so-so, and the pacing lagged at times. But the basic premise is happily reminescent of classics like Sorry, Wrong Number and I liked it well enough that I'll read the sequel."},{"Title":"The making of South Africa","review":"The book has its moments, but it downplays a crucial part of the history of South Africa: the concentration camps of Anglo Boer War II. The book barely mentions that farm houses were burnt down.It does not say anything about the anxiety, pain, and disruption the Boer women, children, sick, disabled and elderly had to suffer - i.e. being whipped onto soiled trucks built for animals to concentration camps. It denies the hunger and thirst suffered, and the ways in which the children died. It also denies that such shock shaped the Afrikaner to a great extent - some lost all their children.The book is heartless - written by a man who probably never saw a picture of some of the emaciated children. The writer is one of the most callous towards the suffering of the Boer people - a people who had their two (twin?) republics destroyed.The book also ignores the fact that the British could have done the same for the Boers as Aramco did for the Saudi's. Geen insists on the uitlanders not having the right to vote, but ignore similar circumstances in oil rich countries.The writer (Geen) is greatly misinformed regarding human suffering and the extent it could carry into the future.British terrorism against Boer civiliansBRITISH TERRORISM AGAINST BOER CIVILIANS tells how the Boer children were terrorized by the British soldiers."},{"Title":"The Motley Fool's Guide to Couples and Cash: How to Handle Money with Your Honey","review":"This book is for people who need to know things about wills, living wills, insurance benefits, powers of attorney, etc. This is not a book about how to budget groceries, merge checking accounts, or move in with somebody that you will probably not spend your life with. It is the nitty gritty financial stuff you need to know and plan on when you are in a lifelong partnership with another person. I found it very helpful and easy to use, and it offers practical advice for hammering out this often unpleasant business with your significant other."},{"Title":"The Motley Fool's Guide to Couples and Cash: How to Handle Money with Your Honey","review":"People never talk about money and when they do it is always with a ton of 1/2 truths. This book gave me the courage to get started and helped my husband and I have productive and painless money conversations. Now we know what is really going on with our lives, what we can afford to spend today and what we need to invest (and where) for tomorrow.And the best thing is -- it wasn't all bad news. This book helped us realize that we are doing a lot of things the right way and that we shouldn't be scared to talk about our finances with each other.

I often don't, as it can be dreadfully boring. But not this book! It's breezy and funny and yet offers critically important information. It's also full of anecdotes and examples from real-life couples who are addressing the financial issues in their lives. The book clocks in at less than 150 pages, so it shouldn't intimidate anyone, and it includes an extensive section of handy worksheets at the end, too. Relationships should only grow stronger, when the folks involved aren't nervously ignoring their finances, worried about how they'll pay for their kids' educations and their own golden years.

I would've liked to see more substance, but I didn't find it. I understand that most couples in America don't discuss finances before or even after getting married, but all of the concepts in the book are simple and basic. I think it's good that the book encourages the reader to be honest with you and your spouse as far as finances are concerned, but it is such common sense, that you're better off reading more content rich books from David Bach (Smart Couples Finish Rich) or Susie Orman (9 Steps to Financial Freedom)."},{"Title":"The Motley Fool's Guide to Couples and Cash: How to Handle Money with Your Honey","review":"I feel a fool to have been misled into purchasing this book.I'm planning on moving in with my boyfriend for cohabitation, and wanted to know the consequences.I was hoping for info on how to share our life together financially.NO WHERE in the book could I find anything about signing rental agreements or mortgage papers,a pre-nup-type form for living together and tips on sharing expenses, or ways to save together,what to do if one is working and the other is attending school, etc.It should mention that different states have varying legal aspects of co-habitation or marriage(automatic 1/2 salary after split-up after one year living together as man and wife).Some common-law aspects.This book only had one small paragraph on buying a home together,and it is continuously referring you to go to their webpages. That's all it does, is refer you to their webpage.Now be aware, I haven't read the book entirely: I have tried their table of contents, and index, and slowly flipped thru the pages to see what was in the book. So the TOC was useless, the index didn't show any useful information.UPDATE: Wow! Like 1 out of 116 people liked my review!I still stick with what I said.I don't need to read a whole book word for word to see if it has useful info in it.One can tell from the table of contents, and the index guide, to see what's in it.

This book has six editors, which, it seems to me, results in this book lacking a clear sense of direction. Many of the selections are questionable. The section on \\"Exchange and Rationality\\" suggests that these topics are more important in *contemporary* sociological theory than they really are (we simply skipped over this section on my theory class). The section on \\"Modernity and Postmodernity\\", simply put, is inadequate for getting a grasp on this (possible) shift. Many of the particular selections are not well edited. Some of the readings for Bourdieu and Giddens, for example, although they take up only 10 or so pages in the book, are culled from much larger selections in the original texts. (A paragraph from here, a paragraph from there.) This results in more confusion than clarity. I think it would be much better if each selection were complete, or nearly so. Surely most of these thinkers have essays or presentations short enough to be included without severe editing?"},{"Title":"Treasure Maps of the Superstitions - The Peralta Stone Maps Show a Route to a New and Different Treasure Than the Lost Dutchman's Mine","review":"Anyone interested in the Lost Dutchman Mine or the Peralta Stone maps or any other true accounts or legends about gold in the Superstition Mountains must get this excellent book.

What a terrific book!We decided to take a weekend trip to St. Augustine, FL this past Wednesday, and left after work on Friday. With very little time to plan, I dug out this book and quickly flipped to the chapter dedicated to St. Augustine. There, the author gives a quick and interesting history of the city, as well as a map with recommended family resorts, attractions, and restaurants clearly marked. This section is followed by impartial reviews of each.The family resorts section goes over a number of cozy historical hand-picked bed &amp; breakfasts and inns, with an eye towards children. It is very helpful in telling you what aged children are welcome, whether breakfast (and what type) is included, accurate rates, distance to nearby attractions, etc.The restaurant section focuses on dependable family-friendly local restaurants. This list is a godsend when you cannot stand the sight of another fast food restaurant, yet are afraid to try anything else.The place where this book really shines, however, is in the attractions section. Here the author and actual readers list and rate each attraction's appeal by age group! This feature is extremely handy in trying to sort through Florida's myriad of attractions with limited time on your hands and with an even smaller budget! We really liked the fact that the author points out lesser-known and less crowded attractions that are often overlooked by unprepared families.For instance, although we normally would never have stopped at anything called the St. Augustine Alligator Farm (I still grin at the name :)), we took the advice of the book and gave it a chance. It turned out to be terrific, one of my 3 1/2 year old's favorite parts of the trip! Another attraction that we would have certainly overlooked was Marineland, listed at the end of the chapter under side trips. Normally we wouldn't have given the park a second look, but we followed the book anyway and spent a fantastic Sunday afternoon there. Much smaller crowds meant that we got great seats at all of the shows, and we also got to spend a good bit of time talking with the animal trainers. My daughter even got to pet, feed, help train, and have her picture taken with a live dolphin! She was ecstatic, and I quietly whispered a thank you to author Pam Brandon for sending us here instead of the ultra-crowded Sea World where we could never have gotten that much time so close to the animals.I overrode the book's warnings about taking a preschooler to the Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum (rated in the book as 1 star out of 5 for that age group, although higher for older kids and adults). Sure enough, Ripley's was way too scary for my daughter, and I regretted not listening to the author's good advice. We could have saved $20 right there - more than I paid for the book!The Unofficial Guide to Florida With Kids saved us so much time and money in one weekend that it has already more than paid for itself. We are currently pouring through our copy working on our next trip. We spend a lot of time and effort on our family vacations, and we want to get our money's worth. We won't go back to Florida without this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Florida with Kids (Unofficial Guides)","review":"I live in Central Florida, so I can say first-hand what an amazing book this really is. It has so many fabulous ideas and great vacation strategies. As a mother of 5, I know how hard it it to plan a well-rounded vacation.

Give this book a read if you're going to Florida--you'll have the best vacation possible."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Florida with Kids (Unofficial Guides)","review":"Ms. Brandon takes the guesswork out of vacationing in Florida, with her common sense approach to this book. Information is organized in a user-friendly fashion that makes it easy and fun to include the whole family in the planning process! Her vast knowledge of the subject matter is apparent; she has given clear and concise descriptions of specific attractions throughout Florida, from a perspective rich with personal experience and humor. Indeed, it is an enjoyable book to read, even if a trip to Florida is not on the horizon!"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Florida with Kids (Unofficial Guides)","review":"We used this book on our trip to Florida this August and was a great buy. It is not a book that lists ALL there is in Florida, but what is BEST to see if you travel with kids. It gives insights that are a rarity in books of this type and it proved good both for things to do and for restaurants that pleased both kids and adults (from diner to real restaurants). We spared a lot of time and, consequentially, money.We used it together with a traditional guide book for reference, but we learned to trust the 'Unofficial' advice better."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Florida with Kids (Unofficial Guides)","review":"The book provides a very thorough representation of what there is to do in Florida with children, but I found a couple of things with which I take issue. First, on page 176, Brandon's advice for Waiting Line Strategies for Theme Parks suggests to use \\"elevator shoes for the short and the brave.\\" Maybe Brandon doesn't understand that the height restrictions for theme park rides is for the protection and safety of kids and small adults, and legal liability of the theme parks! Getting your kids to stand up straighter, or putting heel lifts in their shoes (Brandon's advice) just so they will be permitted to ride an attraction is pretty lame, not to mention dangerous.In addition, I was shocked to visit St. Augustine Beach and see cars driving on the beach. I thought I had thoroughly read the St. Augustine chapter of the book. Guess not. The only mention of cars on the beach is on page 78, listed under Northeast Florida's Best Beaches, NOT in the St. Augustine chapter. I was very disappointed and felt that the driving on the beach is a hazard for young families, and is obviously downplayed both in this book and by the proprietors of beachside motels (particularly the author-recommended LaFiesta Oceanside Inn). All in all, a disappointing book which I feel I can't trust for further Florida adventures with my children."},{"Title":"Christian Book Writers' Marketing Guide","review":"The most important thing about using a writers' marketing guide is accuracy, so a writer doesn't have to waste time and money sending to the wrong place or submitting their work to a company that really doesn't want it! This book is very accurate and up-to-date. It's also very focused and helpful for the &quot;book&quot; writer. If writing manuscripts is your talent, why spend more for a book full of information you don't need? This book has everything a Christian book writer needs to find a publisher and submit your work. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"What D.E.B.S. means to America","review":"This is actually a dramatization of Eugene V. Debs' life as well as a dramatization of his philosophies.

Good photographs, and interesting anecdotes and historical information. Not too deep or involving, but it offers some nice light reading for the theater and opera lover.I bought this for a friend who likes opera and architecture. Would have liked even more information on modern, American theaters, but I'm pleased with the book."},{"Title":"Theatres and Opera Houses (Masterpieces of Architecture)","review":"This volume gives a good overview of the development of physical theater in the western culture. Some color photographs are included of seldom seen theater buildings such as Wagner's Beyreuth Festspielhaus. What is particularly annoying with the book, though, is the frequency of careless mistakes and misinformation. The famous Gutherie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is inexplicably said to be located in Minneapolis, Wisconsin. An obvious late Roman modification of the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens is attributed to the Classical era in Athens.If the reader can get through these and other mistakes, this book will at least provide some extraordinary photographs."},{"Title":"Theatres and Opera Houses (Masterpieces of Architecture)","review":"Far too many artist renderings, and though this was about vintage THEATRES AND OPERA HOUSES a particular theater I was looking for in San Francisco - the Orpheum - was completely missing. (Perhaps the building is too exterior-plain to warrant inclusion.) What's really needed is a comprehensive book, mainly of photos, of these fancy older theaters that are still standing and in use, both interior and exterior shots. Otherwise, it was nice to recognize other theaters I've been to, including the Bolshoi and the Maryinski, though another distressing element is how few interior photos are available, and I think the focus is literally on architecture, so they're serious about the title. Mainly there are exterior shots of standing buildings, with less attention paid to interior construction or decor. Accompanying text is included, of course, though i found some theaters with photos had no text to accompany the inclusion."},{"Title":"Theatres and Opera Houses (Masterpieces of Architecture)","review":"It's a good book about operas throughout the world.

But I'm fascinated by WWII, and compare the WorldWar series to THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY series about the Cold War. THE GUNS OF THE SOUTH was terrific, if Turtledove could continue the WorldWar series with the style and pace he delivered there it would be better for all concerned."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"This book is the 2nd in a series of four. The backdrop is excellent, but there is a real shortage of action in this installment and some of the dialogue gets downright corny. The character development also stopped at some point, because 950 pages into this series, the baseball player characters are still referencing everything they do back to their baseball careers. It does read quickly and a couple of the story lines are intriguing, so not a complete waste, I just expected better with the hype."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"It was a fun read, a pretty decent continuation of the story line from the first book - almost like picking up the same book and it'd grown. However I really have come to expect something more from Turtledove, after Guns of the South. This series really doesn't compare well. It was fun but it left me unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"The study of history today is a perilous profession. Considering the fact that so many &quot;alternative&quot; histories have sprung up in the past decade, it is quite refreshing to see a book like Harry Turtledove's &quot;Tilting the Balance&quot;. In it, Turtledove does what he does best; blend fact and fiction to create a true alternate history- one which never occured, but certainly would have been more interesting than what did transpire in that fiery time of World War Two. The premise is simple: &quot;What if aliens invaded Earth during the Second World War?&quot; The book has adventure, humor and a numer of historical in-jokes, for those that might catch them. My largest complaint about the book is that it tends to simplify things a bit. The actual facts are a bit more entangled than what Turtledove lays forth- yet he brilliantly covers such lacking details up by the simple arrival of his alien Race. The facts don't matter anymore, after that point. Even so, it is plainly obvious that a great deal of research went into writing this novel. Perhaps not as much as Willis' &quot;Doomsday Book&quot;, but still a fair amount. Despite its slight distortion of history, this is a book that's just plain fun. You can enjoy reading it. In science fiction, that quality is essential; too often the writer gets stuck in the mechanics of the universe or the overly complex characters. But in SF, characters can play second fiddle. In conclusion, I give &quot;Worldwar: Tilting the Balance&quot; by Harry Turtledove an 8; great effort and great talent have gone into writing this work, and it would be a shame if I dissuaded some innocent young browser from ordering the book. Whatever is amiss in the book, let us forgive and forget."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I slogged through 3/4's of this novel, having really enjoyed the first one. I felt the author really must love baseball as many characters seems to be affiliated with it in some way. I could care less. Then there is the annoying plot device with Jen's Larsen and his wife and her new fling. I felt the wife was terrible and unsympathetic person and the way she was cold to Jens was awful. Her new husband was likewise a really annoying person. I felt very sympathetic to Jens and it was exactly this plot device and the annoying authorial intrusion where the wife and the new hubbie were talking about Jens like he was a loser which made me decide I couldn't finish this one. From my perspective, the wife and the new husband were jerks, and trying to justify their behavior (which was quite cold) to Jens by being absolutely the least sympathetic people imaginable. Jens had tried very hard to reach his wife, and to be with her but she seems to have dumped him emotionally and mentally. I just can't believe if you love someone as much as she was supposed to you'd switch it off instantly like that. You can love 2 people at once you know. Eh, and then there are the lizards who seem to have developed space travel but cannot conquer earth. They are very idealistic childlike and incompetant. I just could not finish this one. It was too lengthy, not enough action and the Lars Jensen character assasination was irksome, plus the lizards aren't a worthy foe."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"The first book was great, the various sequels are pretty much standardized chapters plugged into a semblance of order by some auto-writing computer program. If you want to find out what happens to those happy-go-lucky guys with ginger on their finger, buy this book and the rest of the series. I classify it as good airplane travel reading. Professor Turtledove writes well and I like his ideas, but some of these books are obviously written only as a sequel. The sex is ok but needs to drip and throb a little bit more. Carnage is pretty standard, maybe some more burning acrid flesh needs to be plugged in. None the less, its a good read so buy it and read it and, hey! keep out of those ginger snap cookies we're sending those to the Admiral of the Overlord Fleet."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"An excellent sequel The fact that The Race isn't these unstopable monsters from the stars in an interesting difference from most books where aliens try to take over Earth.

My favorite characters still strive on despite drastic changes in their lives. Sam Yeager, the ex-ballplayer and sci-fi junkie, continues his role as guard of the Lizard prisoners. He even finds time to develop a relationship to Barbara Larssen.Liu Han and Bobby Fiore get transferred to a prison camp on Earth after she becomes pregnant. There they develop a relationship with Chinese Communists.Some old friends die, but then what would you expect, this is war. What Turtledove does with the remaining characters is enough to keep me interested in the outcome of the series."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Continuing to chronicle an alien invaded WWII earth. In just the second book turtledove numerous plot threads start to slow things down. Where, a chapter about 1 interesting character is followed by 2 you couldn't be the least interested in."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Volume 2 is not nearly as good as volume one. The author gets too lost in the sex thing which detracts from the theme of the series."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Basically taking up where the first book of the series left off, TILTING THE BALANCE continues in the same vein of interesting characters, plus exciting war-time situations & sex/romance, aliens, and technology development.The subplot I found most interesting in this book is the ginger drug habit developed by a significant number of the lizard-like aliens. Mr. Turtledove does an excellent job of describing the mindset of the addicts - for some reason I especially enjoy following the progress of the Veteran Alien Tank Driver Ussmak (who has to face both Nazi Panzer tactics as well as his ginger addiction), and the Alien pilot/prisoner Teerts (whom the Japanese purposefully addict).This 2nd book from the series literally \\"ends with a bang\\", and I'm looking forward to continuing with this series - which is turning out to be almost as addicting to me as ginger is to the Lizards."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"It wasn't until I got into this book that I began to realize that the first volume (&quot;In The Balance&quot;) was a package of preludes rather than a story in itself. This one has some delicious concepts. Such as a woman who remarries when her husband is missing and presumed dead. Only to have her ex show up alive and well. The lizard invaders have a weakness--ginger is a drug which gets them high and is addictive (&quot;don't bogart those ginger snaps, my friend...pass 'em over to me&quot;). Winston Churchill makes a tour of inspection of military readiness on a bicycle. A minor-league baseball manager utilizes his civilian skills when he becomes a sergeant. One of his ballplayers, along with a Chinese woman, becomes an experimental animal so that the invaders can study human mating. The couple end up proving that not speaking each other's language and not having chosen each other in the first place are not necessarily obstacles to love. FDR has to deliver his &quot;fireside chats&quot; from &quot;somewhere in America&quot;, because the country is as much a battleground as anywhere overseas. I still think &quot;Guns Of the South&quot; is Turtledove's masterpiece, but this 4 volume set is still worth the read."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I liked the first book so much that I hurried out to by the second installment in the series. Now that I am two books into the series, I am somewhat disappointed in emphasis Turtledove puts on average human characters that do not have a birds-eye view of the political situation. He attempts to show us progress by repeatedly using Atvar (the alien fleet commander) as a sounding board by which to reveal the political situation to the reader. It doesn't seem as though we get enough of this from the human point of view, however. I'd like to see what is going on in the White House and in British Parliament. I'd like to know what the great historical figures think about the situation. The closest we get to such points of view are narratives about Molotov or occasional glimpses of FDR or Hitler that are far too short.One subplot that had me on the edge of my seat was the Jens storyline. I felt a great deal of sympathy for Jens and was earily suspicious about the fate he would receive. Without revealing the plot, I would just like to say that I wish I could have seen more reaction from Barbara, who seems rather callous in regard to Jen's situation. Why has she reacted (or rather not reacted) this way? I would like to see some more depth of character from all involved in this plotline.All in all, this book is still worth reading, despite a few disappointments. The knowledge that Turtledove brings to his writings is certainly rare and I still like the attention he pays to various historical details, many of which were likely to be lost on me. That I recognized many such details only indicates that there must have been many more."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"The book was mostly enjoyable, though did seem to sometimes skip about and dwell on unimportant characters. My main problem with this book was the subplot dealing with Jens/Barbara/Sam. This seems forced and unrealistic. My impression is that Sam would have been in serious trouble for shacking up with someone elses wife. Instead the author wants us to feel that the husband is the bad guy. It just doesn't play out. Sam, you cheating scoundral, I hope you get nuked in the third book. (and don't beg off that you thought the husband was dead. Missing for a couple of months does not a death make.)"},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"In the first volume of this series, Turtledove has set up the intriguing premise of 'What if alien invaders had arrived in the middle of WWII?'. In order to tell his story from a variety of view points he has introduced several 'main' characters including Americans, Chinese, Russians, Polish Jews, Germans and alien invaders.TILTING THE BALANCE picks up pretty much from the end of IN THE BALANCE with the same characters and various subplots. The aliens had expected an easy victory but where surprised to find how much the humans had progressed in short few hundred years since their survey ship had left. They were also appalled to discover how wet and cold the earth was, they had never before encountered a planet with such a wide variety of conditions and were totally unprepared for the conditions. The humans were proving to be distressingly adaptable, former enemies were forming alliances to fight back, they were even managing to reverse engineer captured alien technology which was causing the invaders no end of problems. But with the colonizing ships already enroute, just twenty years behind the aliens had no option but to press on.This is a very interesting concept but it would probably be much better as a single volume, two at the most instead of the planned trilogy that grew into four volumes. As is usual with stories told from many viewpoints, and with multivolume stories, the author reintroduces each character when their storylines return. Turtledove carries this a bit too far, repeating the same information over and over. He also drags out each plot line, going into far too much detail which makes the overall storyline drag. I found myself skimming over much of the last half of the book, looking for something new and more interesting to happed.Overall I would rate this series a solid five, but due to the overlong execution of the story, this ready should be two volumes at the most, this particular installment just barely makes a four."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"After reading the first book in this series I was pretty much hooked. I thought it was a very interesting idea to have invaders from space interrupt WWII. What is most interesting is that the aliens have our current level of technology.However, In the second book I started abridging Mr. Tutrledove's writing pretty brutally. There are so many contributing plots that really don't contribute, and each sub-plot just rehashes the same themes. When I came to the sections with the Russian Pilot Ludmilla, I knew we would hear about how her German mechanic was always trying to get in her pants but he was such a good mechanic she'd put up with it. Every Time. So I'd read the first paragraph and the last in her section. Yawn.Heavy handed abridging was the key to enjoying this series. The idea is fantastic, and I'm still tempted to read further into the colonization series."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"The whole idea behind this serie is kind of lame. What if during the second world war aliens invaded our planet? I mean, come on, you got to be kidding, right? No? You'r serious?But it works great. The combination of that well familiar WW2 flavour, the historical characters in bizarre situations (Molotov negotiating with the Lizards was worth a laugh) and a well executed what if scenario is highly entertaining. Its a fun read and I enjoyed it a lot.About part II in particular, the story simply continues, it is not worse of better than part I and I haven't finished part III yet. It doesn't really make sense to review the independant parts, its one story in four booklets."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"The original concept of this series was intriguing, and the first volume was worthwhile. However, the author just didn't have enough story to fill FOUR volumes. Aliens with essentially late 20th Century earth technology invading the Earth at the height of World War II sounds a little pedestrian, but the author brings in the aliens' glacial concept of time to the mix. It starts off well, but then Turtledove drags us on and on, with no thought to constructing a real story, just rambling, with his characters' inane dialogue sounding virtually indistinguishable whether the speaker is a German tank commander, British pilot, American scientist or Alien commander. He even manages to make sex boring! With a little skill and some input from a competent editor, this series could have been a knock-out book of 600 to 800 pages instead of a prolongued agony of 2,400 or so pages. (I should be fair and note that I barely made it through this second volume and couldn't stomach an attempt on the other two, even though I had purchased them. That's what used book stores are for.) A relatively minor point is that he doesn't give us any sense of perspective for the size of the alien invasion force. They make a big deal of losing four or five of their modern tanks, which plausibly concerns them since the earthlings aren't supposed to be able even to scratch them, but do they have 100 more, 1000, or a bazillion?"},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"In Worldwar: Tilting the Balance, spring is returning to the northern hemisphere. With the changing weather, the advantage in battle shifts back to the Race. The aliens come from a world drier and hotter than Earth, and even in summer they are uncomfortable. The winter was almost unmanageable.But with the warmer weather, the Race finds itself facing other difficulties. Since the aliens planned for a fast conquest against medieval warriors, they find the unexpected resistance quickly draining their supplies. More importantly, they find themselves battling corruption within their ranks. To them, ginger is a highly addictive drug which creates a sense of overconfidence, and an underground drug trade has developed. Aside from the basic disciplinary problems, soldiers under the influence frequently commit blunders leading to human victories.In the first book, the Russians and Germans managed to steal some plutonium from the Race. Polish Jews forced the German courier to give up half the German share, which they smuggled to the United States. No country yet understands how to make plutonium, and now only the Russians have enough to make a bomb. But Japan learns some key details from a captured alien pilot, and the other countries are progressing. The Race has already used nuclear weapons to destroy Berlin and Washington. Now the world waits to see which country will be the first to use nuclear weapons against the Race.Turtledove's huge cast of characters is the focus of the second Worldwar volume. At this level, the novel is quite eventful. Turtledove gives readers an unfortunate love triangle that arises when one of the principals is mistakenly assumed dead. He also adds a major nuclear accident and the subsequent scapegoating, a subplot around unrequited love, several characters who go into hiding, and some effective use of real historical persons. He even kills off a couple of major characters.Meanwhile, Turtledove's portrayal of individuals from the Race is commendable -- he manages to make them different from humans, but with analogous positives and negatives. Unfortunately, until an eventful final chapter, little of this seems to effect the global situation.A larger problem with the ongoing saga concerns the motivation for the conquest of Earth. The aliens repeatedly complain about how wet and cold it is. Presumably their probes were sophisticated enough to report this. So why are they bothering? Turtledove emphasizes how carefully and deliberately they make their decisions, often taking centuries. Yet they've already sent a colony ship to a world unsuitable for them. Perhaps Turtledove can justify this, but after two volumes, it looks like a major plot flaw.There is still much to like in Worldwar: Tilting the Balance, and Turtledove has plenty of time to overcome the present flaws. If he doesn't, at worst he will still have created an interesting work.Despite my critical comments above, I am enjoying this series. Even where it seems padded, Turtledove still makes it entertaining."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Turtledove doesn't always write well. Sometimes he can get bogged down in the minutiae of all his knowledge, I think, and the story drags. Not so in the World War series. I am learning more about WWII, and enjoying it as well. The characters are excellently portrayed, and Turtledove really gets into their minds. He can balance out a multiplicity of characters, keeping them all separate and easily understandable, unlike say Robert Jordan in his fantasy series. And Turtledove really sees it from the perspective of each of his characters! Male or Female, Chinese or Russian, Human or mythical lizard, he's done his research, and projects himself in a believable way into the mind of each character, so we see the characters come to life and act true to life.This story continues the fight of the ware to end all wars. Turtledove uses the standard of this genre of multiple stories progressing at once, switching between them soap opera style. There are times when the story does bog down a little, but there are so many stories going on at the same time that one can breeze through that section to move on to the next more exciting part. And this isn't just one subject, as some alternative history gets into. There is military conquest, love and romance, cultural anthropology- there are a number of different themes progressing concurrently through the text, to satisfy any reader's whim. So far, I would definitely recommend the series."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I support Jen Larrssen's actions in this book.If i were in his place, i would have done the same thing and instead of the poor colonel and his bodyguard, i would \\"given it\\" to Barbara and the colonel.Jens should have silently gone to the lizards without raising any suspicion. That way the Lizards would have sent denver a very good present."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"The first book in the series was passable, but weak.

I must say that I don't get it. His novel's plots are like poor versions of 40's serial stories. This book is no exception. On the advice of a friend I made my way through the whole series. Take my advice. Don't waste your time. The plot is thin and hacknied. The historical characters are flat. The characters he creates are little more than props to move the predictable plot along.Where to begin? Does anyone ever believe that the Alien's have a chance? Are the german's really this dumb? Are the people who fought world war II really this simple minded? Please.Turtledove, I am sure, has made a lot of money churning out these books. Good for him. Just pity those who read them.If you want good speculative fiction, I suggest K. Dick or Harry Harrison. Both have done better and more intersting work."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Even for those who didn't read Harry Turtledove's In the Balance, Tilting the Balance is still first rate reading.That's because in this installment Turtledove brings readers up to date with the story he told in his book: of an alternate history where World War II was interrupted by invaders from space, a group of lizzard people who look sort of like human salamanders.In the first book, humanity was kind of getting its butt kicked. Picking up where the Germans had left off the Race had not only made themselves masters on the Russian steppe but they'd also expanded their holdings across the rest of the planet. With technological superiority they'd not established footholds on every continent but they'd also detonated nuclear weapons that turned both Berlin and Washington D.C. to dust.In this series Turtledove answers the question of just how humanity will strike back. Though this book does take a little getting going by the end it's nothing less than a thrill ride as Turtledove answers the question of whether human ground forces can outpower their alien competitors in Croatia and also what lengths the Soviets will go to prevent the Race from conquering Moscow.While the answers to these questions are best left for readers to discover on their own, this book is nothing less than an exciting thrill ride and a worthy successor to the first book in the series."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I have to give 3 stars for the books condition.

I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"If you are a Turtledove fan - as I am - Tilting the Balance is more of what we have come to expect. Like all Turtledove series, it begins and contains lots of review and recap - in case you are not reading the series in sequence or forgotten the overall issues and characters from the preceeding novel.Lots of action, good character development and portrayal, and the ever-typical Turtledove development of alternative historical events. Truth! (emphatic cough).I did not give it 5 stars because Turtledove is such a prolific author and I have read almost all of his work that it is almost \\"too much the same\\" as prior works."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I was really torn between giving this four stars and five, since Amazon won't let me rate it 4.5 when it is a solid 4.5.The story in the first continues, even longer, and with really little development save for just the bare minimal progress for humanity, due simply to supply issues for the Lizards.The Bad:Turtledove's writing is still amateurish as in the first one, but thankfully there aren't as many instances of its showing.Like another reviewer complained, Turtledove also isn't keen on too much subtlty in the subplots; in much the same vein of TNA's Eric Young and Don West with their almost inadvertantly comical bashing-us-over-the-head with \\"Rellik, that's Killer spelled backwards\\", Turtledove regurgitates the same summarization of subplots over and over and over again to a point where we just wish something would happen to change the same old story; Ludmilla's pants attempting to be penetrated by Schultz and NKVD guy who's name I forgot, Ussmak's complaining about his crappy ginger-laced prior crew and his love for his new crew, Atvar's bitterness towards Straha's uppitiness, etcetera.The Good:The story progresses far more efficiently with regards to the war in general being basically a stalemate, with major minor actions going on on both sides, and the focus being a race to adapting Lizard technology---jets, radar, and nuclear weapons...Every time I read from the Race's perspective, I bitterly complain with them, the savageness of the Japanese on their prisoner (whose name I forgot), the German panzers being so damn incessant and brutalizing the Race's landcruisers no matter how many losses they sustain. And when I read from Humanity's perspective, I gripe over the seeming punctuous accuracy of Lizard tanks and artillery, the irritation of their constant air barrages, and their clarity in radar and satellite that makes Humans the equivalent of the lowest of Gallic barbarians trying to fight Caesar's legions.There's is a definitely more realistic and mature tone to this edition rather than the first, where main characters die suddenly in the heat of action where the first book had lead you to view these characters as invincible---for one, Bobby Fiore, gunned down while assaulting a Lizard stronghold in Shanghai, Lucille Potter, with the top of her head sheared off by an artillery shell right in front of Mutt Daniels, even Drefsab, our favorite junkie Lizard.As with the first, high-ranking leaders are very scarce, with Winston Churchill making what can only be called a cameo appearance at an RAF research camp, Franklin Roosevelt checking on Brigadier General Leslie Groves at the Met Lab in Denver, and Joseph Stalin pushing hard for the use of Soviet Russia's first nuclear bomb.And at the end of the book, Stalin gets his way...The final words of the book are clear indication that the pace of the war is going to shift in the last book... the Soviets haved nuked a major Lizard invasion force. What now? Straha asks Fleetlord Atvar. Atvar can only say, \\"I don't know\\"..."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"An excellent sequel The fact that The Race isn't these unstopable monsters from the stars in an interesting difference from most books where aliens try to take over Earth. It's interesting to find how humans and our planet create difficulties for them"},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I bought the first book of the saga supposing that I would find a story similar to The Guns of the South. That is, I thought that WWII would be won by the Nazis, in my original view, a much more interesting story than one featuring a invasion from an unknown planet. My initial disappointment, however, was more than compensated for by a nice, enjoyable story, that although pure science fiction, it perfectly makes sense. Maybe the second part is somewhat boring compared with the first book, but it still deserves to be read. To find out how Turtledove will manage to solve the saga continues to be a good reason to read the third and the fourth books."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"It dosen't matter if your not intrested in war you will get caught up and you'll never be able to put it down.

I am certainly excited to read the next installments of the series!"},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"First, the good news. I found Book Two of the Worldwar series readable (though a tad drawn-out); the saga is developing nicely, the ongoing tussle between alien invader and Allied-Axis resistance well depicted, especially in the last pages. However, halfway through, it suddenly occurred to me that the Lizards must be either masochists or have some kind of deep-seated deathwish. Why do I hold this opinion? Think about it. You command an invasion force from a distant star system. Your primitive, pre-Sputnik adversaries are crawling about at the bottom of a steep gravity well. Literally, you hold all the high ground. Then why waste valuable soldiers, pilots and hardware at all? WHY NOT SIMPLY DROP HEAVY ROCKS ON TOSEV 3 FROM ORBIT? All right, that's a bit of a simplification. But the solar system is littered with ample ammunition for your purposes. With big chunks of meteoric iron and rock you can flatten the largest cities, with no need for nukes; with smaller chunks you can pulverize factories, farms, airstrips and railroad stations. Operating from space, you are in effect fighting a three-dimensional war against two-dimensional opponents, able to strike easily at any point on the globe. And yet here are our spacefaring Lizard enemies floundering in the cold mud, harrassed by our tanks and infantry, stretched to their very limits. What's wrong with this picture?"},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"After beginning this book I could not put it down. The suspense that had been building throughout the series was coming to a magnificent climax. The allies and the aliens were destroying city after city, and both sides were getting desperate. The use of actual historic personalitites in alternate-history roles draws mild humor into the book. Where else but in this series could you find aliens addicted ginger? Turtledove paints a fantastic picture that produces a feeling of reality in the reader. After reading this novel I had to reread the series to appreciate the magnitude of the conflict that the author created. This book is a grand close to a truly fantastic alternate-history series."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Often in a series of novels, the first is the strongest while the others offer a less satisfying read. Not the case with this second entry into the World War series.The power of the initial invasion has faded and the long struggle is engaged in earnest in this volume. The invaders are faced with unexpected opposition in the most unlikely places. Among the humans, unlikely heroes emerge.Strongest among the heroes is Heinrich Jaeger, a colonel in the Wehrmacht. Jaeger finds it difficult to accept the unthinking compliance required of him by his Nazi masters, but he is a man of honor who will fight for the survival of the human race against impossible odds, no matter what the personal cost. He is capable of great physical heroism and has a depth of character that questions blind obedience. He grows beyond the nationalistic self interest still evidenced among the fighters of Earth.As the struggle continues, a strange phenomenon occurs among the fighting forces. Each side finds itself drawn closer to the other, not in ideology, but in the details of day to day survival. Both sides are changing as the conflict continues. Neither remains as it was in the beginning.Turtledove's insightful prose strips away the mask of &quot;heroism&quot; to examine the soul beneath the warrior's mask. What he reveals there is a startling examination of the individual spirit.This is not to say that the book lacks action. Far from it. The battles are drawn with stark clarity and heroes die easily at the hands of an enemy. He has also managed to create a credible foe for the human forces, despite their &quot;alien&quot; nature, with a complexity of character that makes the prolonged struggle believable. Some of the &quot;bad guys&quot; grow to be admirable in their own fashion.The skillful blending and bending of history with a strong narrative is sure to capture interest. Add to that characters you really grow to like and respect. The result is a strong second part of the series that demands to be followed to its conclusion."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"After a rather disappointing In the Balance, I was a little wary about starting Titling the Balance. But, thankfully, this second installment in the World War series was a whole lot better. The story and characters have already been set up, so we got into a lot more action. The story got really exciting in the end, what with the Jager/Skorzeny/Drefsab stuff at the end and the stunning conclusion in Russia. I surely wasn't expecting what happened to Bobby Fiore-- that took me by surprise, but it gave me the sense that nobody was invulnerable against the Lizards. Still, like all books, this one had its problems. One of the major ones was the Jens/Sam/Barbara stuff. First of all, in nearly every scene with Sam and Barbara, they're naked and in bed together. That got old real quick, considering I hate this Sam guy. Jens is my favorite character and he certainly gets a kick in the-- as the book eloquently puts it-- nuts. I agree with a fellow reviewer that Jens was treated as a jerk here in this book, while Sam was goodie-two-shoes. Sam's a punk. And so's Barbara, who had no faith in her husband and concluded he was dead and moved on way too quickly. Whatever Harry Turtledove was trying to do here, he didn't do a good job of making the readers sympathize with Barbara and Sam. Instead it felt... disturbing. Nonetheless, that was the only problem I had with this otherwise exciting novel."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I've read, and reviewed, Worldwar: In The Balance. The first book was interesting and a good read, if also flawed. Alas, the second is a huge disappointment.Pretty much all that was wrong with the first book is wrong with the second one as well. Very important is that NOTHING happends. Except for one 'big' event, that is supposed to be shocking even though it was refered to a million times, the situation remains pretty much the same as it was in the first book.Everything is very repetitive. We have millions of battle scenes, which get old quickliy. We get needless descriptions of sex, we get a really bad soap Opera sub plot( more on that later), and we get endless alien bitching about hwo &quot;Chaotic&quot; humans are. It was OK the first book, but now it's terrible.The worst thing, are the characters. now we have no less then three ex baseball players as heroes. Compare that to soldiers(2), scientists(1), resistance fighters(1-2), pilots(2) politicians(1)... way too much baseball.But the worst thing, and the very reason I stop reading this series despite all the good things I said about it in my review of the first book, is Sam Yeager. I just can't stand him. He's simply the worst, most annoying charicature of a character, the brainless brawn that saves the day and gets the girl. I hate his character so much it alone would have been enough to make me desert almost anybook, no matter how good.Fortunately or unfortunately, this isn't a great book in the first place."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"I read the first of this series and was bored to tears with Harry's long-windedness. For some reason, a few months later, I decided to buy this book to see how the lizards made out.What a mistake. This book is so boring that I just skipped entire chapters to avoid having to read one more narrative about some arrested-development adolescent shooting his gun and thinking with his crotch.The one exception to this is the Jens Larsen character who gets utterly reamed by the author. (Note to Mr. Turtledove: you are not Charles Dickens. When you try things like this, you come across as crass and manipulative. Stick to your standard simplistic and silly descriptions of combat.)The villains in these books have to be the biggest morons in the universe and they have so many vulnerabilities (they can't handle the cold? Geeze!) that defeating them is a challenge only for the twits populating the pages of this book.Stay away. This book is a waste of money."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"As with the previous novels, Turtledove shows his talent for getting inside the minds of very different characters.If you are even considering not buying this, it is probable that you haven't read the previous book, because they are addictive page-turners. Buy all the books in the series and enjoy."},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"This was a quick read, the story moves tolerably quickly, but the premise and plotline is pretty weak. As other reviewers have pointed out, the technology employed by the lizards seems primitive for spacefaring aliens from many light years away. However, as a number of other reviewers have pointed out, there is something fundementally wrong with the &quot;love triangle&quot; that involves three of the characters.What I cannot decide is if the rather unbelievable development of the scientist's wife falling for the failed baseball player Science Fiction buff (very droll that)is compelling or revolting. I certainly could not read the book for several days as I realized that this was the way the the author was about to manipulate his characters. The deliberate manipulation of Jens to destroy the integrity of the character in the eyes of the reader is painful. The promotion of the Sam character with the near fawning of a supposedly intelligent female character is blatent and demeaning. In the end I finished the book, because I had to find out - but I strongly dislike this level of manipulation. Given the response of many other reviewers so did they.Overall I will probably have to read the rest of the series just to satisfy my curiosity, but I am not inspired by the books either on an emotional or intellectual level. I would strongly caution anyone about reading the series for the same reason. You are likely to feel compelled but will you really enjoy the compulsion ? I think I will stick to Stephen Baxter"},{"Title":"Tilting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 2)","review":"Turtledove is great, his alternate histories manage to be very authentic (well apart from the use of English slang as I can testify) while not dragging the reader into factual tedium.I find the Race more interesting than the humans however. The use of alien idioms is obviously human generated but still effective. My favourite is: egg-addled. It's a term all of us should use!I felt particularly sorry for Ttomalss in the Russian gulag, which brought home to me the fate of Stalin's human victims.Turtledove resists the opportunity to make the Race a terrible breed of monsters from the stars. Indeed, in work like 'The Two Georges' turtledove seems to have sympathy for Empires (naturally his PhD is in Byzantine history).The Race are an ordered, civilised people, unlike the squabbling humans! Turtledove successfully throws up many scenarios from across the globe with such fluid transitions you wonder how much research the supremely-bearded master of alternate timelines does every day.As a bit of a sci-fi geek there are some things I don't understand. If the Race has the ability for interstellar travel why don't they have better weapons than tanks and jets? What happened to lasers and transporters? Why didn't they bring or manafacture more nukes along for the ride? The answer is that humanity could not have put up much of a fight with such items banging around.Why are the Rabotevs and Hallessi also slow and cautious in development while humans are innovative? Isn't that a bit convenient? Won't all the nukes going off around the place seriously irradiate a much bigger portion of the planet than shown so far?Just how many males does the Race have? Also, wouldn't it have been easier to wipe out humanity with a DNA encoded virus or something? If they have holographic projectors why not something like this? I mean we already have or will have such a weapon.But this is nit-picking. Turtledove is excellent entertainment with brain. I would have liked to have seen more of Hitler's reaction to the race, but this was probably omitted for ethical reasons.

The awkwardly titled \\"Black in Time\\" probably won't come back into print anytime soon, though it's quite a nail-biting period piece. This effort by Jakes is dated at a pretty fundamental level, as it was published in 1970 and was directly informed by the specific civil rights struggles and racial strife of that day, and there are also related issues with crusty slang and dialogue. But these issues are tolerable thanks to a pretty strong premise. In short, a scientist has introduced a time travel device in a near-future America that's on the brink of a major race war. A black militant and a white supremacist both attempt to use the time machine to go back and alter history for the benefit of their respective races. The protagonist Harold, a peaceful black scientist, tries to prevent both bad guys from the unknown effects of time travel (the handy \\"don't alter the future\\" theme for all post-Bradbury time travel stories), while also exploring his own racial sympathies and internal struggles. This is a suspenseful and rip-roaring story with some deep thoughts on human nature and racial conflict, though Jakes zooms through his plot devices way too fast to really explore the full ramifications of his story. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"BLACK IN TIME.","review":"\\"Black in Time\\" by noted author John Jakes is an entertaining and perceptive time-travel novel. America's future as envisions in this story is bleak indeed. A riot which resulted in a white policemen being killed is all the reason a charismatic white minister needs to goad his acolytes to start a race war so the blacks can be put in their place once and for all. A man of color forces a black scientist to take him back in time so he can do the unthinkable - alter history by any means including murdering so the black race rules the future not the white. The charm of this book is the author's use of actual historical events and personalities - it's almost a black history primer.In his introduction to \\"Black in Time\\"(1970) Jakes states the following: \\"Of the two dozen or more science-fiction novels I wrote during the 1960's I am fondest of two or three, \\"Black in Time\\" is one of those. The author's admiration aside this title has only been published twice, both paperback editions - the last being in 1988. Bart Book published the 1988 edition.John Jakes, author of several very popular historical fiction series, started his career writing fantasy and science fiction stories for pulp magazines in the 1950's and 1960's. This may come as a surprise to many of his fans since none of his early fiction has been republished for many years.I am no fan of time-travel stories - I just cannot buy-in to the idea. I will say this: the author has considerable talent breathing life into a historical place and event. Overall an interesting book if you are so inclined."},{"Title":"BLACK IN TIME.","review":"One advantage of this book is that it has a hilarious cover: leaving it on your coffee table will guarantee a hit conversational piece.As for the text itself, it pretty cheesy. It's a time-traveling story about a Black militant and White supremacist who each try to go back in time to change things around in favor of their race. Like any time-travel story, though, there are serious problems with the plot."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I first read this story nearly 30 years ago, when I was not quite yet a teenager; I've read it many times since. It never fails to delight, fascinate, amuse, and enthrall me. It is by turns hilarious and innovative, combining science, fantasy, whimsy, and adventure in an intoxicating magma that explodes in an eruption of high drama. OK...perhaps that last sentence was over the top, but when you're trying to describe a fantasy tale about the explosion of the Krakatoa volcano, you can get burned by using too many cute metaphors and adjectives. Look...let's keep it simple. This book rocks. It rolls. It even shakes and rattles. The story is funny, the scenes are well-choreographed, the premise is captivating, and the narrative is told in a splendidly droll manner. So, if you are 10 years old, or 20, or an old geezer like me who still likes a good kick in the head every now and then, buy this book and read it. It's got balloons, diamonds, sharks, a volcano, exotic foods, fantastical houses, and stuff that will blow your mind. Now...please tell me you liked this review!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Kids obsess over the darndest things. Scooters. Small electronic pets. Plastic accoutrements that somehow incorporate the word \\"jelly\\" into their titles. And while I am an ancient 26 years of age with only dim recollections of my idyllic midwestern youth, I think I can say with perfect certainty that there is one subject that very very few kids obsess over. Ballooning. When was the last time your child begged you for a lifetime subscription to (actual publications) \\"Ballooning Magazine\\" or \\"Aerostat Hot Air Balloon Magazine\\"? This isn't to say that when the local carnival comes to town, some kids wouldn't leap at the chance of hopping into one of those balloon rides that go up and down. But will they seriously seek out literature that feeds this all-consuming hunger for all things dirigible? William Pene du Bois apparently thought so. And so, with his 1948 Newbery Award winning, \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\", Pene du Bois gives us a tale that is part Jules Verne part H.G. Wells with just a touch of Rube Goldberg for spice. And while I doubt that many children today will pore over the intricate technical aspects of this otherwise fun ride, they will at least be intrigued by its tale of a man, his dream, and his encounter with a truly original society.If there was one thing Professor William Waterman Sherman was tired of, it was teaching mathematics to little children. For years and years he'd done it and finally, once retired, he was given a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. Sherman would outfit himself a fabulous balloon. It would be the second largest ever commissioned and would carry a small wicker house, in which Sherman would be able to sail in perfect peace and comfort. Containing a great deal of food, the hope on his part was to be able to sail around the world for at least a year without having to come into contact with another human being. On August 15, 1883 he sets out above the Pacific in a single balloon to live in the sky. On September 8, 1883 he is picked up by a passing American freighter in the Atlantic while, \\"clinging to the debris of twenty deflated balloons\\". How is this possible? Where did the balloons come from? How did he travel around the world so quickly? And what stories has he to tell? \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\" is Sherman's wild, impossible, and truly original tale of his time spent on the island of Krakatoa, mere days before it exploded sky high. And what he found there will astound.Pene du Bois begins this book with a rather touching caveat. He points out that just prior to publication his publishers couldn't help but notice similarities between this story and F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, \\"The Diamond As Big As the Ritz\\". Pene du Bois admits that some of the similar details are a bit striking, but that he really hadn't heard of Fitzgerald's version before. A quick perusal of the two stories is enough to convince me that Pene du Bois is certainly telling the truth. Though in both tales we view rich opulent societies that own a mountain filled with diamonds and use their wealth to maintain both secrecy and a higher standard of life, Fitzgerald's story is obviously a slyly clever critique of his contemporaries while Pene du Bois concocts a delightful confection of various \\"what ifs\\". Kids reading \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\" will instantly wish to find themselves on Krakatoa (pre-volcanic eruption, of course) and to eat at a different restaurant establishment every night.The best word for this particular book is \\"innovative\\". When Sherman crash lands, nude, on Krakatoa, he meets its European inhabitants. Because they are so incredibly rich (all due to Krakatoa's diamond core) they spend their days inventing wild games and conveniences while indulging in delightful foods and expansions of the mind. Pene du Bois's original illustrations bring Krakatoa brilliantly to life while also explaining the technical aspects of everything from balloon merry-go-rounds to beds that change their own sheets. Though I sincerely doubt that any publisher has gone so far as to print this book without the original pictures, make absolutely certain that your book has them if you're going to purchase it. In some ways they brought to mind the delightful scribbles of Ronni Solbert in the equally amusing children's book, \\"The Pushcart War\\".Many kids find themselves saddled with the assignment of choosing and reading one Newbery Award winning book for school. And a child could do far worse than choose the charming, \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\". I like to think that the book is as much fun to read as it was for William Pene du Bois to write. Brilliantly conceived and full of lovely little ideas, this is one award winner that's certain to remain much loved for years and years to come. A pip."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I have just about every Newbery Award winning book on my bookshelf and I've read most of them. But not all. In particular, many of the ones written before 1950 or so still need my attention. So, periodically, I try to pick up one I haven't read and give it a go. Having just finished reading Simon Winchester's Krakatoa, where he gives such a glowing report of this book, I pulled it down from the shelf.This is a fun book. It tells the story of a retired math teacher, William Waterman Sherman, who builds a balloon to help him get away from it all by spending a year floating through the skies. Instead, he quickly finds himself downed on the island of Krakatoa where he finds a secret colony of people living quite comfortably. He joins them. Unfortunately, in a couple days, Krakatoa erupts, destroying the island almost completely. Fortunately, the colony had prepared for the chance of eruption and everyone is saved.Published in 1947, this book is filled with a little interesting science and a lot of fantasy. If it has a weakness, it is that this book feels a little more dated than some of the other older Newbery winners. It doesn't feel dated because of its content, however, just its prose style. Its a little formal and relates a post-Victorian view of the world which many young people probably will not understand very well.Still, I enjoyed this story and the drawings by Mr. DuBois very much. When it comes right down to it, you can hardly go wrong with a Newbery winner. Still one of the best signs of excellence in the world of fiction--for children or no."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"My teacher read this to me in the fourth grade,and I was so into it, I insisted upon reading it with my Dad and my seven-year-old brother.

I could never tell you the whole story, so I suggest you go check out this book, or buy so you can read it anytime! This good for people who like adventure, geography, wealth, and a good imagination!

When the book arrived I decided to read a few pages just to make sure it was something he might like. I never put the book down! I read the entire book, being careful not to bend the pages. Oh! what a delightful story. At 59 I was saying to myself, \\"Well, if he could do that, I wonder if this, or that could be done too?!?!\\" I knew then that this book was perfect for anyone, young or old.

In all fairness, I seldom have ever read fiction, but this book has a unique plot about it and offers fascinating elements of a story. At 19, I'm tempted to pick it up again as a refreshing escape from Macroeconomics and Brief calculus.The Twenty-One Balloons is an excellent read at the surface. However, it also offers up serious literary excellence. Any middle school English teacher, who would have their students read this book, would talk endlessly about the merits of the book. Foreshadowing, dynamic characters... it all flows evenly to produce a work easily readable for younger crowds but intense while still somehow whimsical for older kids.Overall, you won't be able to put the book down, and that's a serious assertion."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Wow--this is a book that I will never forget, but let me expand on that seemingly gratuitous comment. \\"I will never forget\\" this lovely tale in a variety of senses that most texts fail to entertain or touch upon that later come into my daily life. As a girl forced to read such dull societal \\"classics\\" as Little Women and the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, this book was the first that addressed my love of science, a blend of imagination and what the future can hold, and a modest suspension of disbelief while still fascinating and entertaining with every page! And the illustrations are quiet and beautiful, telling and spare, and lend a reality to the words as icing on the cake. I now bequeath this book often as a gift, since not many have heard of it, and every recipient has enjoyed it--truly! I highly recommend this book as an escape from prescribed reading at any age"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"William Pene du Bois creates a fantasy for all children in the Newbery medal book The Twenty-One Balloons. When Professor William Waterman Sherman, an old school teacher, is found drifting in the Atlantic Ocean among the wreckage of twenty-one balloons, America is struck with mystery. Only two to three weeks before, he had flown off over the Pacific Ocean, in a balloon from San Francisco, on a one year voyage to peace and quiet. Professor Sherman has an adventure of discovery, between his liftoff and crash , with people from his hometown. For this adventure, though, he won't need his survival skills. I liked the way William Pene du Bois gives you a very discriptive mental picture of everything that happens in this book. This makes it very easy to understand, but it also makes it a little slow for advanced readers. He combines a little adventure with a lot of fantasy to create this imaginative book. It is though, I think, more for children going into middle school because of the reading level. This book was first published in 1941 and I think that its popularity still now tells how good it is."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The Twenty-One Balloons by William Pe'ne Du Bois is a very good book. It starts with W. Waterman Sherman, a schoolteacher in San Francisco, who wants to get away from it all for one full year in a hot air balloon. Just going any where the great winds took him. He thought he would have a nice long ride, and then something went (perfectly) for the better.Back to Sherman, in a heap of wood, barrels, and twenty large balloons almost drowning! But, his story starts when he goes in one huge balloon (the Globe, a huge one room apartment in the sky) across the ocean and is attacked by seagulls. With that, he lands on an island, not any ordinary island though. He lands on the island of Krakatoa, that island is a volcanic island.Though this book leaves you hanging a little too much, it describes this island place very well. This fiction book is set far back, for me, in time (1960's) and is funny. On Krakatoa there are lots of people like Mr. F, Mrs. F, F1, and F2. Every one is named that way on the island, from Mr. A to T2 every letter is there. Also on the island there is one thing that always helps the islanders, the largest and vastest diamond mines that are under the volcano!!!!This book is very good at pulling you in and never letting go. I would like to thank Mrs. Shaffer, the great teacher that told me that this is a great book and then made me read it, thanks. This book is great for kids 8-14 because it has a lot of neat things most people dream about. Also because it is kind of like a fairy tale but, a adventurous one. I would recommend this book to any one so, happy reading every one! KRAKATOA!!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"What a peculiar story!

Instead of finding a deserted island, however, he comes upon a strange community of people.The community has a source of wealth, a magnificent diamond mine, that allows the people to do anything they wish. The people have created a zany civilization founded upon the idea of restaurants, eating out at a different family's restaurant every night. Sherman is shown novel designs for homes and odd inventions that have come from the clever minds of the island's residents. Despite their apparent creativity and great wealth, the people choose to live on an island that, every hour of the day, threatens their lives. And, of course, as one might expect, the moment comes when Krakatoa blows. Somehow, the people are able to escape without harm and Sherman is able to return home to San Francisco.

I enjoyed the book's easy to understand descriptions of his life on the island. While reading it, I was never caught wondering why this book was written. It has was written for the enjoyment and pleasure of reading it. The compelling story makes you want to go out and try to ride around in a hot air ballon the rest of your life. Rich, but easy to understand details flow through a perfect plot. We learn that life is enjoyable even when you don't have something to do or somewhere to be and you are away from society.The 21 Balloons starts out with a man, Professor Sherman, who wishes to go around the world in a hot air balloon. He starts on his journey, but soon disaster strikes. A seagull tears his balloon forcing him to descend and crash land. He eventually wakes up on the island of volcanic Krakatoa where he is greeted by a man. The island is not thought to be inhabited, but it turns out that 20 families of four live there in a village that is situated far from a volcano that contains a secret. Under the volcano, there is a cave that is so full of diamonds that you have to wear sunglasses to look in it. This is the main reason the families stay on the island. Although they each own a share of the diamond mine, if they were to spend them diamonds would become equal to dirt, because diamonds would be so common. The families each run a restaurant that serves a certain type of food. For example, the F's serve French food and live in a French style home that they built by trading a few diamonds for materials in outside countries. Their life is simple. After their day of cooking they don't have to worry about cooking for another twenty days. The children and parents just relax and do nothing the entire day, that is until the volcano erupts.I enjoyed The 21 balloons. It shows how relaxing and enjoyable it would be to live on an island away from society with no worries or work. It illustrates the simplicity of spending a day doing nothing and not having to worry about it. The book describes a place were food is good and you never have to worry about money. I also enjoyed the fact that throughout the book there were scattered inventions that would still work well in today's society. As the characters are introduced we learn about them and their background which helps us understand the book better. The book is a simpler story, bursting with details, that is for all ages. The author points out many flaws of the outer world to make the island seem like a paradise, but if you read the story you will find out the island is not. If I could change anything about the book I would have had Professor Sherman live on the island longer and get to know the people better because I felt like we only know the main characters and all the other characters barely interacted with him.I found it interesting that it seems that the book could possibly be true. The island of Krakatoa did actually explode around the time of the story and it seems that there isn't anything mentioned that was not around at the time of the story. I think that people who enjoyed this book would also enjoy The Phantom Tollbooth because they are both books that are easy to understand but can be enjoyed by all ages. They also make the outside world seem different.The 21 Balloons by William Pene du Bois is a story for all ages. It is a set in a relaxing paradise but has a twist in the plot. It is easy to understand and I enjoyed it. It was written for enjoyment and was not meant to be a book that would be groaned at by a group of middle schoolers. It makes you want to relax and throw away your worries. The details are simple but flow together perfectly. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I read this, plus other books written by the author, ~50 years ago.

After about five to six month on the island he leaves the island and returned back to San Francisco.I liked the book because he made it kind of realistic. Except for one thing, the diamonds where the one that was not real. The book was also like an adventure movie. If you are really into an adventure book you'll like this book. I liked how Professor William Waterman Sherman acts because he likes to fly.I chose this book because I heard this book was GREAT! The person that told me that it is good is Eric Wynn (my brother). I also picked it because I had nothing read. Once I read a few pages just to check if its good; I thought it was pretty good because of all his inventions."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"This book was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It tells a fasinating tale of a secret island. The island of Krakatoa is thought to be complety unihabitable, but one group lives there anyways. When Proffesor Sherman stumbles upon the island on cross Pacific trip he must stay there for life. The island has many odd iventions and ideas. One of these is the restaurant government. The children have also built a ballon merry-go-round. This book had a great storyline, that left me unable to put it down. It makes you think, can there realy be a secret land right under our nose."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The Twenty-one balloons is a very good book.

I liked the way that Williams responded to all the news in the book, when he was stranded on the island because his hot-air balloon popped becouse a sea-gull rammed into the balloon and made a hole.

Professor Sherman left his head quarters, The Explorers Club, with one balloon. Fully lavished with any basic home supplies that you would find in your very own house. Chairs, walls, doors, plates, and even clothes.The real mystery is that when Professor Sherman was found stranded in the Atlantic, he didn't just have 1 balloon but he had 20 of them. Throughout the story the professor gives his mysterious story of what happened; like all most becoming some sharks dinner and how he survived.He was stranded on an island called Krackatoa. Krackatoa was an island that was abandoned due to a volcanic eruption. Could it be that there are really people surviving on that island? Fooling the rest of the world so they could be in peace? Or can the island just be an abandoned island that the professor has to live on? Read the book to find out the real story of Professor Sherman's island.I thought that the overall book was very good!! At the start it is slow; but once two chapters pass the book is hard to put down. The book holds loads of details that make the book interesting and worthy of the Newberry Award that the book earned.

He was also creative in the sense that he thought of all the neat inventions the Krakatoans have. See, an explorer,(former math teacher)was tired of the monotonous days of his busy life.Spit balls, gum, paper airplanes, the usual for every teacher. So, he constructs a large, grand, balloon and sets off to wherever the wind may take him. You see, his intention was not to land in a certain destination, but to simply drift around undisturbed for a year or so.But, alas, how could a creature as tiny as a seagull ruin this magnificent balloon? It tore a hole in it, and the balloon, unable to keep the helium in its curved dome, sank into the sea. But the professor woke up on the shores of the island of Krakatoa. Will he die? After all, this is a wild, desolate island isn't it? You will see after you read this book full of creativity, fantasy, and imagination.My thanks to Mr. William Pene du Bois for this wonderful masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Anybody would love this book.

There is very little plot actually; the narrative mainly consists of stories within stories, told by the Professor himself or Mr. F. But the book is fast reading and highly imaginative. We discover mind-blowing inventions and a hidden, American society on a volcanic island called Krakatoa. He finds a Gourmet Government, all financed by secret diamond mines of incredible abundance.

Then the book was renewed in 1975. I'm talking about the newest addition. This book won the Newbery medal. The story's time period is the 19th century. The main character is the professor by the name of William Waterman Sherman. The professor takes a hot air balloon from San Francisco, California. He intends to fly across the Pacific Ocean. Instead through a twist of fate, he lands on an island called Krakatoa.The theme of this book is the secrets of Krakatoa.Krakatoa is a tropical island apart of the Pacific Islands area. Krakatoa is a legendary island of unimaginable wealth, eccentric inhabitants and fantastic balloon inventions. When the professor finds out the secrets of Krakatoa he must stay there forever unless he can escape.In one part the professor falls on the ground because the earth's shaking and then Mr. F, another important character, says \\" You can now see why Kraktatoa was always considered unfit to live on\\". There are only eighty people who live on Kraktaroa. After arriving on Krakatoa the professor asked Mr. F, \\" Am I dead'. Then the professor asked \\"Is this heaven\\". On the island the professor mainly went into diamond mines and went swimming.In my opinion the reading level of this book is for 4th graders and higher.The professor received a pair of diamond cuff links made from four diamonds the size of a lima bean. He said \\" these were given to me by Mr. F on the first day I arrived at Krakatoa\\".The problem of this book is that a mountain causes earthquakes and there is going to be an earthquake hitting Krakatoa and they have to build something so that they can escape. What would they build and how might the escape? You'll find out if you read this book.Written by Drew"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I was absolutely shocked at how much I loved this book! I did not expect such a magical, fun-filled, and adventurous plot. The author begins the first chapter at the end of the story. This was a unique introduction to the main character, Mr. William Waterman Sherman. Mr. Sherman is a quirky, retired math teacher who sets sail in his hot air balloon, the Globe, in search of a peaceful, yet exciting adventure. However, a mischievous seagull has a different plan in mind for Mr. Sherman, after tearing a hole in the beautiful Globe balloon, and causing it to descend rapidly. What happens next is unpredictable! Mr. Sherman finds himself in a Utopian wonderland called Krakatoa. The society and lifestyle established on this island is extremely unique. Mr. Sherman hopes to fulfill his retirement dreams on this bizarre and unknown island, loaded with wealth from the infinite diamond mines. Will the native Krakatoans welcome Mr. Sherman, or is this the end for the old math teacher? You owe it to yourself to read this amazing novel. It will keep you at the edge of your seat and most likely, out of any hot air balloons you may encounter.

This book inspired me to read more about travel. -Jazz"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The book I read was The Twenty-one Balloons by William Pene du Bois. This book was about professor William Waterman Sherman and his adventures. He takes a balloon trip and crashes on the island Krakatoa. It's mostly about what he does on Krakatoa and the things he learns about the Krakatoa natives. The main plot is when Krakatoa erupts and they have to evacuate the island.I liked the book very much. The book was so exciting to read. The different ideas in the book were amazing. It was so creative. The information and how creative it was is the key of why the book is so great. I was also able to feel that I was \\"in\\" the book. I could feel this, because I was wishing that I was there and I could also feel and see what it would be like to be in their situations. The main conflict interested me, because I wanted to see how Professor Sherman got off the island. I also was curious about how he lived on the island, which was very exciting, because the island was so amazing and unique.The author's writing style would probably be very educated and informative. The vocabulary was very interesting or hard to understand, because many of the words were scientific and difficult. Even though I am sure everything he said was factual, it was also kind of boring and too informative at those parts. The author's ability with description was above and beyond. You would be reading about one of their balloon inventions in the book and he would describe how it works, what it looks like, and every other thing he could describe. All that description would take about 3-7 pages. Then when he was describing their restaurant calendar, he also went into that with great detail. So I think his writing style was descriptive, but maybe too descriptive, well at least for children.I would give this book 4 out of 5. I give the book this rating, because it was very descriptive and interesting. The plot wasn't the most exciting though. Also as I've said, it was a little too descriptive. This made it somewhat boring.This book seems great for anybody. It's really creative and most people will think most of the creativity is really cool and interesting. I believe that you will respect and enjoy how creative this book is, no matter what your interest or what your age is."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I thought this book was very interesting because it mixed non-fiction with fiction. I would recommend this book to anyone. I learned that there was a real island called Krakatoa, and it did explode in the late 1880's. Even though it was a good book, some parts were page-turners. Sometimes it talked about things that made my mind wander. There were some surprises in the story. When his balloon came crashing and he had to head for the island. I didn't know what was going to happen. At the end of the book the press asked, \\"What are you going to do now.\\" Professor Sherman said, \\"I'm going to build another balloon."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"It won a Newbery Award in 1948, and it will be obvious to any reader why it won.

And that's pretty sad, considering that I should be too old for that kind of stuff.THE 21 BALLOONS follows the adventures of Professor William Waterman Sherman as he tries to escape his old life of school days and bad kids. (He was a math teacher at an all-boys school. I pity him.)He sets out in a balloon, one that has a sort of mini-house as the basket. He spends a few days happily flying around the Pacific ocean, until one day a seagull makes a hole in his balloon. He throws everything overboard, and aims to land on a small island. The island's name? Krakatoa.He is received into the Krakatoan society, and given a share in the HUGE diamond mines that each of the twenty families on the island own. (By the way- I love the way that the society is described in the book. Very detailed. And the naming system, too... though I don't think that I would like to be called something like 'K-2'.)The families live in great wealth and comfort, and they have a society totally based on food. Each day of the month, a different family cooks, and they all have equal shares in the mines. But everything isn't perfect...There's a volcano on the island, one that is REALLY active. It causes the island's earth to continually move up and down in waves... a sort of blessing, and a curse, because it keeps the other people of the world away. Professor Sherman is the first person that had been to their island other than themselves, EVER.And, of course, while Sherman is on the island, the volcano erupts. Luckily, the families all have an escape plan; a huge platform with twenty balloons attached that lifts everyone up and away from the island. Again, problem; they only have 80 parachutes. So Sherman has to try and land the huge platform...As I said, I love this book. One of the best children's fiction stories that I've read, ever... and the magnificent sketches by Mr. du Bois that describe the island really make everything come together more."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The 21 Balloons is a great story for young and old- about the round-the-world travels of a balloon enthusiast/explorer set in the 1880s.

I liked it so much that I read it again when I was twelve, and again at thirteen. I went on to read several other stories by the same author, but they have gone out of print, and only this story has lived. It is a masterpiece that (as nobody seems to have noticed in their reviews) is based on Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon. I strongly recommend this story for all kids who love adventure and Verne's brand of science fiction. The illustrations are great."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"When Professor William Waterman Sherman, the main character of this lighthearted fantasy, attempts to pilot a hot air balloon across the Pacific Ocean, things do not go as expected. His personally designed, luxury-style balloon crashes on the island of Krakatoa.There on the island, which seems completely isolated from the outside world, live a group of incredibly wealthy diamond speculators who have left western civilization behind and created a society of their own. Their world is occupied by terrific time-saving inventions and a unique system of communal living. One example of their lifestyle: the families, who were re-named A-Z when they moved to Krakatoa, alternate the hosting of meals each day. The cuisine matches their letter of the alphabet (the C's specialize in Chinese food, for example).The islanders, eager to keep their fabulous wealth to themselves, have vowed never to leave. That is, until a volcano erupts, forcing all to abandon the island in a contraption made of 21 air balloons. The eruption of Krakatoa was an actual historical event, though the island was thought to be uninhabited. The addition of history into this fantastical story is a pleasant touch.This imaginative adventure was a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The twenty one ballons is written by William Pene du Bois. The main character is Professor William Waterman Sherman. Professor William Waterman Sherman wanted to be the first one to fly across the Pacific Ocean. He wanted a big balloon because he wanted to be on the air for a year or at least many months. On the big balloon there were chair and a table made out of balsa wood and bamboo. Professor Sherman had a library of paper bound books printed in small type. Professor Sherman's food and liquids were chosen with the idea of saving weight. Professor Sherman carried a strong shark fishing rod and he hoped to catch a few fish to increase his food supply. Professor Sherman planed to wear one set of clothes and wash the other by attaching it to shark fishing rod and dunking it in the ocean. All of Professor Sherman's laundry was done. After Professor Sherman left San-Francisco a lot of things happend. If you want to know more about it then you can check it out!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I read this fine novel as a fifth grader with my entire class. Adventure that even made the ongoing sand bomb wars of recess pale in comparisson. I truly believe this engrossing book started me on the path to a lifetime love of literature. The exotic locals are a great spark to entice ones intrest in Geography and travel. Absolutly first rate!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"My fiance' read this book when he was young and he insisted on us reading it together. It has been quite enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Our story kicks off with the exciting discovery and rescue of a sophisticated professor named William Waterman Sherman, who is stranded in the North Atlantic amid the wreckage of twenty-one sadly deflated balloons. It's the first sighting of this adventurous professor since is departure from San Francisco three weeks earlier. But that day he'd floated off the pier in one large balloon, not twenty one. How did he come to be helplessly adrift in this odd array of debris?Sherman's fans in America are desperate for an explanation, and after some rest and pampering for the retired teacher, they get it. Thus the exciting tale of The Twenty-One Balloons is born, masterfully told from the perspective of this eccentric and imaginative old man.Apparently Sherman's change of plans is all thanks to a seagull who punctured his balloon whilst he floated, carefree, above the Pacific. But it was all for the best in the end; Sherman's necessary crash landing led to the discovery of a secret island called Krakatoa, inhabited only by twenty families...and one incredible treasure store of diamonds. The lifestyle on this almost-magical island takes wealth, invention, and ingenuity to unprecedented (and extremely humorous) heights. Sherman's riveted audience only encourages his far-fetched descriptions and elaborate tales of what took place on the enchanting island...until the next catastrophe that led to the discovery of Sherman and the balloon wreckage in the first place.The Twenty-One Balloons is one of my favorite humorous family novels. Bursting with creativity and comical descriptions, it's the perfect lazy-summer-afternoon read for kids of all ages.Recommended read-aloud age: all agesRecommended read-alone age: 8 and upTo read more of my children's book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The Twenty-One Balloons by William Pene du Bois has become one of my favorite Newbery Medal books. This book has so many things going for it, and I want to list a few:1. The Story: The author tells a story that mixes fiction and non-fiction. The setting for most of the story is an island in the Pacific called Krakatoa. The natural events that happen on Krakatoa really did happen. The volcanic island exploded in the late 1800s creating the loudest audible sound in recorded history. I enjoyed reading the authors fictional account of what might have happened to the community on the island while all the explosions were building and actually happening. I also thought the style of writing was excellent and kept my attention. After I read the first chapter I was in.2. The Audience: Sometimes I get the feeling that the author envisions a certain gender reading the book they write, and in the Newbery Medal books, for the most part they seem to be girls. That's certainly not always the case, and it is just my opinion, but I sense that girls enjoy reading many of the newbery books more than boys would. BUT, I would say this book is certainly Adventure and certainly for boys! The way he even tells the story is the way my 9 year old would today. This alone makes it worthy of much recognition. I also read somewhere that this could be a great introductory book to science-fiction for young readers.3. The Author: William Pene du Bois was an amazing man. He not only wrote the book but he illustrated it as well. While this is not unique to Newbery books or authors it is rare. I Pene du Bois is a very acclaimed in his illustrations apart from his writing. Two books he illustrated won Caldecott honors(1953, 7) This puts him in a small company of people that have won both honors in children's literature.There is also a little controversy around this book, and the author recognizes that in his book. It turns out that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a story in the 1920s on a very similar subject. At best this is an amazing coincidence at worst it's plagerism. Pene du Bois claimed that he had not heard of or read the Fitzgerald's work until after he had written his. Apparently the writing community accepted this and no one made a big deal about it. After all he did win the Newbery.Overall this book is Excellent! A great book for young readers, especially boys. For sure one of the better Newbery books."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Bought this for my 9-year-old granddaughter and read it before bedtime when she is visiting. She has enjoyed it very much so far."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"O.K., 1947 isn't actually the Victorian era. But you get a whiff of that old Victorian air as you read this. Then add the inventions and marvels our hero discovers, and you have a sort of very gentle proto-steampunk kind of vibe. Add some whimsy that doesn't make your teeth hurt, a narrator who isn't channeling Rex Harrison's more manic turns as Dr. Doolittle, and some old-fashioned charm, and you really have something.Read a couple more reviews here and you will get a decent sense of this book. I think the most helpful observation is this: if the book really catches your young reader's fancy it could be a lifetime favorite read (my niece fits into that category). If the book doesn't grab the kid, it will still probably be counted as a decent or worthwhile read. It's very unlikely to be actively disliked, so as an experimental choice you sort of get a win/win."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I first read this as a kid, which was -- ahem! -- more than a few years ago. I think it is at just the right level for a child in the 8 to 12 range. It has the relatively brief length and the right mix of adventure and humor to hold the interest of most preteens, although I have to admit to being far from an expert at what attracts preteens these days!One note: There is no doubt that this book bears a very strong resemblance in a number of ways to F. Scott Fitzgerald's story \\"A Diamond as Big as the Ritz.\\" Du Bois has a brief note at the beginning of the book indicating that the resemblance is pure coincidence. While I don't believe du Bois consciously stole from Fitzgerald -- who would be dumb enough to steal the plot of such a well known story? -- it strains credulity to believe that du Bois had not read Fitzgerald's story at some point. I will hazard a guess that du Bois had read Fitzgerald's story many years before but had forgotten it. When du Bois came to write this book, he unconsciously made use of the earlier story. At this late date, though, I doubt we will ever know."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I read this book aloud to my daughters. It is the winner of the 1948 Newbery Medal.We loved it! What a great adventure story! It is about a man who yearns for a peaceful, solitary sojourn in his hot air balloon, only to end up on an inhabited but undiscovered island called Krakatoa.The book is very entertaining, and we loved the \\"way of life\\" on the island of Krakatoa. The author has a great imagination!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The twenty one balloons is an excellent book for children and adults. The story is well written and interesting and very imaginative. The story also holds up well with age. The only shortcoming of the story is that it is a bit too short for adults and you will be finished with the book all too soon."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The book the 21 Balloons by William Pene Dubois is a well-written story about a man who was so desperate to be alone that he used a balloon to stay in the air for a year. I enjoyed this book very much and wish I could read it again. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes comedy and adventure."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"If you liked Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne, you will enjoy this story also. A professor wishing for a peaceful, solitary vacation takes to his hot air balloon only to land on an inhabited island where life is anything but dull! This story is particularly interesting in light of the recent Icelandic volcano eruption."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"This book was interesting and forced you to have a good imagination! Some of the words were confusing, but detailed. The book provoked thoughts into your head like &quot;What if there really was a place like that?&quot; and &quot;What would I do if I were in the Proffesor's position?&quot; The book was interesting but sometimes draged out a little a long. If you like adventure and imaginable places a little more than me, you'll love this book!!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The Twenty-One Balloons is every child's dream come true. Fantastic adventures, mysterious locales, riches beyond imagining and exciting inventions that have not been invented to this day. The writing is easy-going yet even now as an adult, I find I keep picking this book up to read it again!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Fantastic adventure with peculiar touches, such as the cantankerous nature of the narrator. A great way for a child to start thinking about the fleeting nature of wealth. Very similar, in subject, to F.Scott Fitzgerald's great short story 'The Diamond as Big as the Ritz', a fact which DuBois acknowledges in a short foreward and professes ignorance of prior to his own book's publication."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Reviewed by a second grader. I can just imagine myself with Professor Sherman landing on the island of Krakatoa. Krakatoa is volcanic island filled with diamond mines. Some diamonds were as big as boulders.

Each family took turns cooking for eachother one day a month. Will they escape the volcano when it erupts?
