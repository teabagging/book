The first three chapters concentrate on general debugging ideas without being very technical. The next five concentrate on very specific parts of .NET (assertions, logging, ASP .NET/SQL, remote debugging, multithreading). Chapters 9 and 10 return to a somewhat non-technical focus by talking about bug tracking and source code control.The author talks mostly from personal experiences (\\"I had a coworker who did this. On further investigation, we determined that were doing [the basis of this chapter's section] wrong.\\") This makes the book engaging, but a few times, it leads the author into tangents on COM and interop. As someone who writes in 100% managed code, I didn't find those tangets particularly useful. I appreciated the absence of grammatical errors and poorly constructed sentences.Chapter 9 (\\"Defect Tracking Programs\\", aka bug management), Chapter 8 (\\"Multithreading\\"), and the first 3 chapters were very well-written with a good number of \\"Aha!\\" moments. Even chapters that concentrated on technologies that I do not directly use every day (ASP .NET, logging with TraceListener, remote debugging) were comprehensible without previous domain knowledge.Be warned that the few code snippets in this book are in C#.I also recommend \\".NET Gotchas\\" which goes into the idiosyncrasies of C# and VB. Who knows, armed with that knowledge, you might never have to debug! :-)"},{"Title":"Debugging Strategies For .NET Developers","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was so good that I figured I finally had to write a review, which I have often thought of doing for other books but never actually done. This book is full of great debugging techniques and strategies, many of which I was familiar with but just as many which I had not encountered before. The author uses an engaging style of writing making use of real-life examples from his own career that are both interesting and relevant to the technique he is describing. I found the author to be very knowledgeable and very good at communicating that knowledge."},{"Title":"Debugging Strategies For .NET Developers","review":"This is one of the best debugging strategies books I've read.

Keep up good work!"},{"Title":"Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography","review":"What makes &quot;Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography&quot;, such a moving work is its unique approach to the biographical format. Rather than just recount his research into Haring's life, author John Gruen has pieced together writings by Haring, the artist's friends, companions, mentors, and dealers. The narrative switches perspective quite often, resulting in a balanced and more revealing account of Haring's life and art, from different points of view. Among other things, Haring recounts his beginnings as a graffiti artist, his rivalry with the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and his coming to terms with being gay, and eventually, his contraction of AIDS. Profusely illustrated throughout, the book also gives an inside look at several aspects of the 80's art scene in New York city. By the end, the reader gains not only a thorough knowledge of Haring the artist, but more importantly, an understanding of the humanist philosophy and intent behind the art"},{"Title":"Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography","review":"I had always been under the impression that biographies were purposely designed to be dull and pointless, until I picked up this book. I have always liked Haring's work and wanted to find out more about the man himself. Not only is this book a biography but it contains words from Haring himself. It is very accessible, all chapters are broken down into easy to read sections and you can dip in and out of the book as you wish. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in his art (it contains many colour photographs of his more famous works) and all those who are interested in learning more about Haring's colourful life."},{"Title":"Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography","review":"I first became interested in Keith Haring as an artist when I saw a collection of his work at the Tampa Museum of Art in the very early 1990's. By that time, Keith had already passed away; however, he left behind a very large legacy of his remarkable work. I decided I had to know more about this man whose colorful pop art had caught my eye, so I went out and bought the book, &quot;Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography.&quot; This book is awesome!! It is part autobiography, part miniature art gallery. Keith's story is told in a very intimate, revealing way, and it really makes you feel as if you are right there in the middle of his life in New York in the 80's. All of the famous artists and people from the entertainment world that comprised Keith's social circle are also included in the book, offering up their observations and anecdotes of Keith Haring, his lifestyle, and his art. There are many personal photographs of the artist at work and with his friends included in the book, as well as eye-popping photos of some of Keith's famous works. Often Keith Haring is called a &quot;grafitti artist.&quot; When you read this book, you will realize that he is more than just that; Keith Haring was a down-to-earth man whose stunning and sometimes controversial art holds a universal appeal and a bittersweet social commentary of life as he knew it. Art lovers - don't miss out on this one!"},{"Title":"Folk Religion in Japan: Continuity and Change (Haskell Lectures on History of Religions, No. 1)","review":"Very informative, but a bit dry in places. Personally I like that, but another person may be put off by it."},{"Title":"Heat and Dust. Mit Materialien. (Lernmaterialien)","review":"This is a well written book that explores Anglo-Indian relations through the power of romance. Set in two distinct eras, colonial India of the nineteen twenties, during the time of the Raj, and the independent, freewheeling India of the seventies, during the time when India was a mecca for disenfranchised youth, it tells the story of two women.One story is that of Olivia, the wife of a minor district official in colonial India, who in 1923 caused great scandal by running off with the Nawab, a local Indian prince. Divorced by her husband, Douglas, for this scandalous transgression, Olivia remains in India, while Douglas remarries. The second story is that of the narrator, a descendant of Douglas and his second wife. During the nineteen seventies, fascinated by the story of the now deceased Olivia, she goes to India, visiting those locations where Olivia had lived and those which would have been a part of her existence at the time. As did Olivia, she falls under India's spell. As did Olivia, she, too, has an Anglo-Indian love affair, and picks up where Olivia left off, giving the reader a powerful sense of de-ja vu.The book is a beguiling story of two women from two different generations who come under the spell of India. The book is evocative of British colonial India, as well as of India of the nineteen seventies. During both eras, Anglo-Indian relations are pivotal to the budding romances. The book is evocative of the rythyms of Indian life in all its richness and tumultuousness, as well as its lingering poverty and superstitions. It is redolent of a time gone by and hopeful of what is to come. It is also an interesting dichotomy of the good and bad in both cultures, Anglo and Indian, and the influence that both cultures have on these two women, who are so different, yet so alike.This is a book that whets the appetite, leaving the reader wanting more than the author is prepared to give. It is, nonetheless, a book well worth reading. The book was also made into a Merchant Ivory film starring Julie Christie and Greta Scacchi."},{"Title":"Ashlee Simpson - I Am Me","review":"This is the matching folio to Ashlee's second album.

If you're a hoops junkie, you'll definitely dig this book with all the funny little stories Bill has about his college and CBA days. I give it only three stars though because it's your proverbial sports biography book and the writing is well...shall we say, not going to win any Pulitzers anytime soon. Heller will refer to something time and time again in the book, but not give you the full story until 100 pages after first referring to it. Case in point being the 1972 Minnesota-Ohio State fight which he constantly brings up, but nevers gets fully into until halfway through the book. It's a frustrating style of writing, but then again, so was Bill's defensive coaching style in the NBA (just ask Pooh Richardson). Not much is written about his T-Wolf days either with the book coming out just before the inaugural season began in 1989. Aside from the poor writing and lack of coverage during Bill's Timberwolf tenure, I'd say the book is worth reading if you followed a Musselman-coached team, especially the Gophers program. When Heller finally does write about the 1972 fight, it is the most comprehensive amount of info I've seen on it and he talks to a number of participants. I wasn't born at the time of the fight, but had always heard about it and never quite got the full story until reading this book. Hopefully though, Bill will be remembered for more than the Buckeye-Gopher skirmish like his 1972 Big ten championship, four consecutive CBA titles and tenacity of being the hardest-working coach in the NBA. Flip Saunders said that the popularity of basketball in the state of Minnesota would not be where it is without Bill and he's right with how Bill sold-out Williams arena every night and got fans interested with the Globetrotter-esque warm-ups. So thanks Bill for the memories and thanks Bill Heller for giving us fans a view into who that frenzied coach on the sidelines really was."},{"Title":"Timberwolves: Stalk the Nba Obsession : Bill Musselman's Relentless Quest to Beat the Best","review":"Biographical look at one of the most intense coaches in basketball history.

Would you allow your boss to put any name he liked on your pay check? NO, you wouldn't, so why do you think we can give the creator any name we want. Jesus and Jehovah are not the names of the father and son. These names come from the adversary Satan. The father and son both have Hebrew names this is confirmed in the original Hebrew text, and in your KJV. In the book of Psalms 68:4 we read this:Psalms 68:4 Sing unto the Almighty, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name YAH, and rejoice before him.Yes my people, the creator of heaven and earth, name is Yah. In your KJV the name listed, is JAH. That is incorrect, there is no letter J, J equivalent, or J sound in the Hebrew language. In fact the letter J is one of the newest letters in the English alphabet. It came into usage sometime after 1630; Jesus or Jehovah wasn't in the original 1611 KJV (King James Version).Many of the Hebrew Prophets carried the name Yah within their names.SUCH AS: OBADYAH which means Servant of Yah,ZechariYah - Yah RemembersIsaiYah - Yah is salvationZephaniYah - Yah HidesThe Phrase Hallelu'Yah means PRAISE YOU YAH.Notice in your KJV (King James Version) the spelling of those names are different, Isaiah doesn't have the YAH at the end, nor does the other names and Hallelu'YAH has JAH in the suffix. Why is that? Simple the adversary Satan is trying to take the name of salvation away from you. He is deceiving you into calling upon false GODS. YAH's name mean THE ETERNAL, THE SELF EXISTENCE, Jehovah means nothing, it's a vain name. Yah said not to take his name in vain, this is one of the first commandments.Exodus 20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of YAH in vain; for YAH will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.He will not hold you guiltless brothers and sisters, Christianity has put you into a confrontation with the most high. Christianity has deceived you into taking the creator's name in vain, you have made it useless, by calling him a false name. Jehovah is not a Hebrew name, Jehovah is not an English translation of the fathers Hebrew name. His name is on high; YAH does not need a translation for his name. All men on the face of the earth, in every language can pronounce his name, YAH.In the KJV (King James Version) Exodus 20 doesn't mention Yah's name, it calls him by two titles, Lord and GOD.Exodus 20:7, Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.The KJV says not to take the name of the Lord in vain. LORD is not a name it's a title, So is GOD. Lord and God both have roots in Paganism, both can be traced back to ancient pagan deities. Many bible dictionaries and concordance will tell you Wherever Lord and God is written in Scripture that the name should be YAH. If you have a concordance in your KJV bible, look under the name Yahweh, it will read this:.........Whenever the words Lord and God appear in large and small capital letters, the original Hebrew reads YHWH.YAH IS THE ALMIGHTY, THE CREATOR, THE HEAVENLY FATHER, THE MIGHTY ONE, THE ETERNAL, THE SET APART ONE. These are righteous titles, his name is above any title, he wants us to call upon him by his name. Jehovah is not his name, nor has it ever been.Yah the almighty didn't name his son Jesus. Jesus is a Greco-Roman- English hybrid name. Just as Jehovah, Jesus is not a Hebrew name nor does it have any meaning, it too is a vain name. Jesus was not in the original 1611 King James Version of the bible,, . Nor was the name Jesus Present in any of the earlier English bible translations. The name Jesus isn't 500 years old. So how can this be the name by which men must call upon to be saved, if it didn't exist at the time the messiah walked the earth?The messiah's true name is Yahoshua, it means Yah's salvation, his name tells his mission. Names are given in the Hebrew Culture based upon the character of the person. I was not born with the name Obadyah Ben Ysrayl, I took on this name after I found my true life calling. My name in Hebrew means Servant of Yah who is a son of Israel.When the angel pronounced the messiah's name to Joseph, he told him his name would have something to do with saving:Matthew 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son. and you shall call his name Yahoshua for he shall save his people from their sins.He shall bring Salvation to his people Israel. The name Jesus, on the other hand, has no association with any thing, but deception."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"throughly enjoyed this little book -it is stocked with treasures i had confirmation on and some stuff i hadn't known--Great Facts!!!"},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"I have seen this information in a number of sources, but never in one book.

When it started to get dark and I had to turn on the dome light, I realized that I had read most of the book. I don't think that I totally understand every thing in the book and I am sure that I don't agree with everything .

A fascinating book indeed, though he makes some interesting (to say the least) leaps to conclusions of coincidence with no documentation other than to say something like - Go ahead and research it for yourself. He gives no bibliography, works cited, comparative reading suggestions, or even a curriculum vit to show how he thinks he got to be an expert on the topic.

I agree with the man on his points and it was a HUGE eye opener that gave me hope beyond what traditional Christianity teaches on so many points (ie the pagan origins of Christianity today, the 10% tithe, eternal damnation in real fire, and the church today, how the Nazarenes believed differently and how the Bible has been misinsterpreted in many ways), HOWEVER, the spirit in which this book is taught is what I was uneasy about. The carnal mind CANNOT and WILL NOT understand the things of YHWH. I sense a great deal of pride and self-righteousness although I cannot judge anybody's heart. The point is, when you come into the fullness of the gospel and REALLY KNOW IN YOUR HEART THE ACTUAL GOOD NEWS (seldomly taught) THAT JESUS DIED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD AND IS RECONCILING ALL TO HIMSELF, you will stop majoring on the minors. For example, do I think Christmas is pagan by tradition, YES! However, God looks upon the heart of man and the reason we do things.. I would even say that messianics that refuse to take part in any of their families traditions because it's \\"pagan\\" and are arrogant and self-righteous/prideful about thier positions instead of resisiting BECAUSE of true conviction and a love for The Father are in the same boat with the religious Pharisees whom Christ condemned in their practices. It's important to be LED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT in all things and read everything WITH WISDOM \\"RIGHTLY\\" Dividing the Word of Truth!

There is no verifiable evidence for this.p16. He says the the Septuagint has the name of Yahweh preserved in in in \\"paleo-Hebrew.\\" There are a few fragments that do so, but this is not true of the majority of LXX mansuscripts.Some of these, most notably that of Aquila of Sinope, actually postdate the translation of the LXX by several centuries.

Who started them, where were they initiated and when?Now I understand the meaning of the title, &quot;Fossilized Customs&quot;.Lew White has done excellent work at uncovering the debris that has kept traditional customs &quot;worldwide&quot; from being revealed.In a simple way, he removes the camoflouge from the &quot;origin&quot; of today's practices of tradition and uses of symbolism, to reveal just how spiritually &quot;deadening&quot; these forces are in our lives.It is quite disturbing how much of man's tradition through the ages has &quot;replaced&quot; the truth of our Creator's Word. If you are seeking a life altering experience and outlook, read this book.Your eyes will be opened to the origin of many practices that are generally accepted and even &quot;expected&quot; by all in our day.This book seperates those who are hungry for the meat of our Creator's Word, from those who just want the easy milk.After reading this book, i have come to the conclusion that it is one instrument being used in our day to separate the &quot;wheat&quot; from the &quot;chaff&quot;.If you want to understand what is going on around you, rather than blindly going on with your walk of faith, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"ever wondered why many things are done in Christ's name and seem so far removed from the Bible?

But don't just take my word or the author's word. Examine it in the light of the Bible. And always ask God with sincerity to reveal the truth to you because He will reveal Himself to those who really seek Him but hides Himself from those who are casual enquirers merely.

Most of the information is readily obtainable from good household dictionaries and encyclopedias for verification. The &quot;secular&quot; sources often quoted serve to prove what people already generally know, and I've used Scripture to show how these ideas are the opposite of what the heart of our Father really expects of us (given what He has revealed to us through Scripture).&quot;Filled with lies&quot; -- We'll need to be specific so each &quot;lie&quot; can be exposed through whatever &quot;truth&quot; lense is being used.

Regarding the fact that many Islamic followers pray to Mary: simply go to www.google.com and put in the words; pray, Mary, Islam -- and you will find out the truth of the matter. Simply talking to someone who is Islamic may or may not reveal to you what is really going on; they are taught that Mary was an Arab, and you will learn that they do, in fact, pray to Mary. Many times in modern movies you will also see the &quot;prayer beads&quot; used by Muslims. The appearance of the &quot;rosary&quot; in Catholicism is tied to a supposed &quot;vision&quot; or apparition of the Virgin Mary to 3 young girls in the formerly Islamic (Moorish) city of Fatima.

It exposes the vast deception which has stood as the foundation for so much false doctrine. Lew has done such studious research than one must pay attention even if they don't agree with the conclusions. I have personally taken it upon myself to accept his challenge to examine his research - And I have found in my own research that what he says is true. Although myself and some others feel that he can be a little &quot;over-the-top&quot; or &quot;nit-picky&quot; about some things (wearing black, wedding bands, etc.), there is no doubt that his book has welled up within me a new truer love for the Torah and the entire TaNaKh. His teachings about the true name - YHWH - are fantastic. Although, I haven't found enough evidence in my research to agree that the &quot;New Testament&quot; was &quot;originally&quot; written in Hebrew, thereby giving weight to his claim that &quot;Lord&quot; &amp; &quot;God&quot; are wrong. The writers of the NT were familiar with &amp; used both Greek AND an aramaic Hebrew. And I see referring to YHWH as Lord or God as okay - They're not His name, but titles, just as &quot;Mr.President&quot; is not George Bush's name, but his title and both are applicable in addressing him. But overall, this book is absolutely amazing and should be apart of every Truth seekers library. But be forwarned; After reading this book, you'll know a lot of Truth and most likely, many things will need to change - but if it does for you, what it did for me, then you'll WANT to change. I am buying many copies to share, thanks to the very affordable price, compared to its limitless value.

Stick to Joel Osteen, TD Jakes, etc. But if you want the truth backed up by historical documentation then, you will appreciate this book even if you may not agree with everything that Brother White is saying in this very important book. Fossilized Customs is for those Messianic Believers who need a reference resource when witnessing to others about your faith in Yahshua. I would also like to suggest this book to anyone who is being guided by the Holy Spirit to flee and abandon the pagan customs of the modern christian church and need a resource in addition to Scripture. Don't let anyone fool you, you know if you're being called out of \\"Babylon\\" and if you're being called out this book helps to clarify scripture that for generations has been taken out of context to manipulate and deceive the masses to accept a Messiah who according to modern christianity, is more Greek than Hebrew.

In the first criteria, the book didn't disappoint; even as an accurate record of where many Christian rituals arose, it might be correct, although I am not enough of an expert to verify that. I hope no one reads this thinking that if one celebrates Christmas or Easter, which do have much in common with pagan ceremonies, one cannot be a \\"true Christian.\\" Please, seek other more reliable sources if you are interested in this topic. On the other hand, one cannot say that Mr. White's observations aren't colorful and interesting.What is a terrible shame is the poor editing.

First thing that I realized is that this is not a professionally written book. It looks like it was typed on a typewriter and printed in a basement. The second thing I noticed is every statement that was presented as fact was completely wrong. I've only thumbed around and read for about twenty minutes.For example:Pg. 86, \\"Catholics instituted this annual observance of passover into a weekly observance.\\" He is wrong and ill informed, Mass is held daily, actually every minute of everyday. Same page, \\"they would possess the powers of the deity (by receiving communion.)\\" What an idiotic statement that has nothing to do with Catholic teaching.Pg. 73, Eusebius is called a Church Father. He uses his statement to contradict what the actual church fathers wrote.Pg. 52, \\"Roma, the original name of the city,\\" No, not the original name of the city. If this author had actually traveled there he would know that it is still called Roma.Pg. 156, an illustration blames falling O2 levels and the rise of green house gases on Christmas, saying: \\"Christmas is destroying 100's of millions of trees each year.\\" How bout googling Christmas tree crop replenishment? As a matter of fact, how about googling anything?I will write a more in-depth review if I should be able to stomach reading this thing more thoroughly. I will say this in closing. All the Christian theology, history, and apologists books I read, Catholic or Protestant have footnotes and citations. They also have actual historical backgrounds to them. This book appears to be a collection of old-wives tales that grand-pa told Lew White 80 years ago while he was rocking back and forth on the front porch."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This book has an interesting thesis...that most of our current Christian customs can be traced back to pre-Christian pagan customs and ideas. While this is true, the author has allowed the book to be filled with inaccuracies. However, the inaccuracies are hidden among many truths in the book. One example is Mr. White's continually referral to Germanic deities as Celtic, and he also refers to Woden/Odin of the Germanic pantheon as a pagan sun god, which totally ignores what we know about Odin from any source on Germanic mythology. He also refers to the Angles and Saxons (both being tribes of Germanic descent) as being kept in control by Druids. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of pre-Christian Europe knows that the Druids were the priesthood of the Celts, not Germans. And I haven't even touch his glaring blunders made on his assumptions about Roman religion. All these things are said within the first ten pages of the book.Unfortunately, he makes all these mistakes and hides them among facts that anyone that has ever picked up a world history textbook can tell you ARE true.

It clearly shows how spiritually &quot;deadening&quot; many of our common practices have been.The book will refresh and revive the fire of truth that has been set within you by our Eternal Creator. Fossilized Customs is a fresh yet provocative look at how the human race has &quot;set-in-stone&quot; dangerous patterns of thought and reckless abandon for our One True Creator.After reading this book, I firmly believe it is one of the tools being used in our day to separate the &quot;wheat&quot; from the &quot;chaff&quot;.If you want a fresh look at the history of humanity, with all of our blatant disregard for our Creator, that continues to this very day, then read this book.Fossilized Customs is for the believer who seeks the meat of our Creator's Word and is no longer satisfied with just milk.

It points out the fact that pagan worship in any form is not acceptable to YHWH in any form. It literaly challenged what I have been putting my faith in all my life. I found out that I had put my faith in lies handed down to me by my parents and the &quot;christian church&quot; forefathers. It promotes the Truth in a &quot;in your face mode&quot;. It does give Scipture references to all that is said inside. Not only does it use the Scriptures for references but it uses encyclopedia's, world history,books that you can get in any library to see for yourself ect... . It proved to me that everything has an origin from which it started. It showed me that the Truth has been twisted from its original form.

He brings the believer back to the two fundamentals of the Messianic faith, namely belief in the Messiah, without whom there is NO salvation, and observing the Torah.Any sincerely Christian or Messianic believer should read this book.

I would definitely say this is a good book."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This is a dangerous book to read if you are not serious about the purity of your relationship with your Creator. The information in FOSSILIZED CUSTOMS can be easily verified from other sources such as encyclopedias, and yet the contents of this book will come as quite a shock to most people.My husband and I bought a case of these books to share with family and friends, and we witnessed a very wide range of reactions to the material. Some responses were positive, but for most people the comfortable traditions of a lifetime proved to be a stronger force in their lives than the truth of history or of the Scriptures. Some people wonder, as we did, why these things aren't being taught in churches by our supposedly wise spiritual leaders. Most pastors have even LESS desire than their church members do to \\"rock the boat\\" of the status quo.Does it really matter if we use the actual names of our Messiah and of our Creator, or are the names \\"Jesus\\" and \\"God\\" acceptable substitutes for the real thing? Should we keep ALL of the Ten Commandments, or can we slide by with just nine of them? And what about those Christmas trees and Easter baskets? FOSSILIZED CUSTOMS explores these topics and many more.Next to the Scriptures themselves, FOSSILIZED CUSTOMS is the most remarkable book that I have ever read. I highly recommend that you investigate the contents of this excellent book and that you verify the facts for yourself through other sources such as encyclopedias, the internet, and, of course, the Scriptures.Don't wait for your pastor or priest to tell you this stuff. Don't waste another day wandering aimlessly in the fog of man-made traditions and theology. The TRUTH will set you FREE!"},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This book observes its own set of fossilized customs: the custom of ignorant, feareful fanaticism. I would have given no stars if that were an option. This book is a mere distraction from what is truly important in matters of faith and love. It abandons one set of traditions and customs in favor of another. Furthermore, it reads like an angry rant, as opposed to a carefully researched book.I would also remind the author: it is not the readers' job and responsibility to catch and document the many errors in his book. He may challenge his readers to do so, (as he did in his post) but that turns his book into a scavenger hunt for fallacies, as oposed to an informational read. The burden of proof is on him, from Alpha to Omega, hopefully BEFORE the book is published.I'll help in one spot:The book states that Santa Clause was green, and elfish until Coca-Cola used him in their campaign, and dressed him in red, but this is simply not true. If one checks any children's book, or Christmas card from the 1800s, this statement is clearly false. But then again: what does this have to do with ANYTHING? I found myself asking this question throughout the book."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"As a Torah observant goy, the book is scary as to when it is or can be right. The implications are painful in that they will separate you as a cult from all of your Christian friends if followed to any degree. I had already incorporated most of Mr. White's advice before I had read the book, but if one were to incorporate the differences concerning the names and titles given to The Holy One and His Son, it would be impossible to have any spiritual communication with even society as a whole. I guess that Mr. White feels that his experts can beat up everyone else's experts concerning the proper pronounciation of the Names, though he seems to be his only Hebrew expert.Mr. White's arguments are frequently well stated and typically stand on their own without citing secondary sources, though others are right that he avoids citing his sources. On the other hand, any tenuous link between a pagan tradition and the modern custom is good enough for him (e.g. we put children on Santa's lap, they put children on Dagon's lap, therefore Santa Claus is Dagon). The links between items become laughable when they are drawn in the wrong chronology (e.g. individuals with low iodine in their diets were called \\"Crestin\\" by the early French Swiss, later to evolve to the term \\"Cretin\\" meaning \\"stupid\\". The reason they were called \\"Crestin\\" was that despite their physical and mental deficiencies, they were still worthy of respect. This does not mean the term \\"Christian\\" evolved from \\"Cretin\\" as he asserts, but vice-versa).He feels that people should separate Torah to a \\"Moral Law\\" and a \\"Ceremonial Law\\" and obey only the \\"Moral\\" portion (which would be a good start). He then does little to outline which of the 613 commandments are which. Finally, I can't help but shake my head at his horribly unfounded fear that the fissile material on the space probes could somehow cause Jupiter to flare up to another star. It's a very minor point in his book, but one that is in my field of work and gets under my skin.When he's right, he's really right. When he's wrong, he's painfully wrong. When you can't tell, it would be horrifying if he were right."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"Fossilized Customs by Lew White is a very insightful and thought provoking book. I started out about a month ago researching material for a bible study and came across Lew White's Fossilized Customs online which led me to his book by the same name and Jeff A. Benner's His Name is One. Yahuah certainly works in mysterious ways. Here I thought I'd discover names and supporting scripture referrences of our Creator, Saviour and Holy Spirit and have enough material to last a few bible studies. Little did I know that Yahuah had other plans - as he always does. All that I've been taught in church and accepted while growing up are now being challenged. I'm aware of what our bible went through with the rise of Emporer Constantine so I've been very receptive to all of what's been shared in White's and Benner's books. I know that Yahuah would not lead me where his hand can not guide me. The material that's been uncovered for bible study has turned into deep, meaningful life changing lessons that will affect many. Now, when I pray, I call upon the name of Yahuah and Yashua and have taught a few to do likewise. May the fruits of these writtings be bountiful and may all who partake be blessed! Shalom"},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This book was a real eye opener and turning point for me in my religious journey. However, after reading it, I was left feeling that it did not go far enough on it's own. The basic premise is that Christianity borrows many of its beliefs and traditions from other \\"pagan\\" religions and that a return to Torah is needed in order to have a \\"pure\\" religion. However, if you research further, beyond the scope of this book, you'll find that the Torah itself borrows stories, ideas, aspects of God's (or the gods') personality, and laws from even older \\"pagan\\" religions especially those of Egypt and Mesopotamia.The fonts are varied and the illustrations are entertaining. The book (as mentioned in other reviews) is written in a rather eccentric and exciting way, jumping from here to there, almost as if you are reading the thoughts as they come into Lew's mind.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This book changed my life. It opened my eyes to so many things I was never taught in my christian church. The book is thought provoking and life altering. I feel like I have been born again, again.

This was all prophesized from the scriptures we have today to the ones banned by the romans that people would go into darkness and wake up at the end.

It really hurts to read the Truth when you have been led to believe lies for your entire life.

Concerning the statement that Islamic people don't &quot;pray to Mary&quot;; please conduct a search for more evidence on the web using the words Mary, pray, and Islam.

It was a great read. He has cleaned it up a bit since the 4th Edition. So no thoughts are left off in mid stream. If it's too all over the place for you, read it more than once. I read it once and got it and I'm NO scholar.I love the humor in FC. I was brought up in these pagan ways for 30+ years (No religion but believed in a higher power outside myself). If you can't take his little poke of fun at these pagan customs, you need thicker skin, because he's not malicious about it.The letter and the law are very simple and Lew does NOT confuse it. Yahusha said He did NOT come to destroy the LAW or the PROHETS and Til heaven and earth PASS, one jot or one tittle shall in NO MEANS PASS from the law till ALL be done (Matt. 5:17,18 paraphrased).I've only been a believer for 4 yrs. and when I started learning the truth, I didn't want to be called a Christian. We struggled for these past 4 yrs as to what we were and Lew showed us the answer. We're Natsarim.Not everyone can agree on the exact pronuciation of Yahuah's name but one thing we know for sure, HIS name is NOT G-D orL-RD. Not everyone can agree on Yahusha's name either but we know for sure HE was NOT named J.C. nor did HE ever hear anyone call him by that name. We do not argue with others about the pronuciation of HIS name we're just happy when people are NOT saying the PAGAN titles/names.This book is truly the RED PILL! Do you have the FAITH to take it?

The Church has embraced many traditions and has upheld tradition over scripture. This goes for Catholics and Protestants. Wether it be the tradition of mass and the way it is performed or the tradition of fundamental baptist churchs, Christians have gotten caught up into a religious system. Unfortunatley thats where my agreement with Lew ends. He would have us trade the \\"religious\\" system of Christianity for the \\"religious\\" system of Judaism. He spends way too much time argueing over what name to call The Creator. When I read the scriptures, I get a picture of Jesus who was sent by The Father to fullfill the law. To free us from the Law. To free us from our debt to the Law. Jesus said the law would not pass away. And law is set up to be what we will be judged against. But as Paul wrote, Jesus has freed us of that judgment. We are free to love and obey God. The early church had a huge struggle over on gentiles converting to Christianity. The jews wanted them to convert to Judaism as well. Paul settled that. Some of the traditions such as a christmas tree are so far removed from their pagan origins that they are no longer pagan in nature. If a christian with a true heart devoted to God sets up a christmas tree to help celebrate the birth of the savior, God will not look down upon them in anger. Paul used a shrine to a pagan god at Mars Hill, to teach the people about God. Paul also spoke about people eating meat offered to pagan gods. The bible says that it was ok for the people to eat the meat if they were not convicted otherwise. There are many more rebuttals to Lew Whites book in the Bible. Christians need to be careful when reading this book. Dont convince yourself that you have a higher morality and closer relationship to God because you call Jesus Yeshua. Dont give up the traditions of Christianity just to get caught up in the traditions of Judaism. Instead seek to realize what beliefs you hold that are just tradition and seek to give them to God. Then follow His word, both the old and the new testaments. Enjoy a relationship with God and not a religion about God."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"Lew White is one of the largest owners of a pornography store in Louisville, KY.

I understand that perhaps he is angry for having been taught all the lies before being taught the truth by the Holy Spirit, but still, he comes across in angry tones. This book is great though, the learning that one receives is imperative to understand how things have been hidden from our viewing, but when we are born again by the grace of God, we come to know most of what is shared in this book because the Holy Sprit guides us into all truth if we seek truth. If you feel comfortable in your Sunday pews and like being taught what the Bible teaches you instead of reading it for your self asking the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth, then you wouldn't like this book at all.

Tracing the origins of many familiar traditions present today in religious groups, and we all should progress, restore, go back to the original faith."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"I learned a lot from Lew White. This is a must read for truth seekers, and followers of Yahushua. It is important to gain knowledge in order to be set free from the deception that has swept the world and the church."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This is the most informative book I've ever read and I believe that everyone should buy this book and have it near your bible for reference."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"I have read Fossilized Customs several times over the past few years and from the first reading to the last, which I just completed, there are three things that I have noticed: Mr White's facts and opinions are based on historical accuracies, his style of writing is rambling and difficult, and he often pokes fun at those pagan beliefs and those who believe them.I will start with the first item. Many of the beliefs and rituals of Christianity are, in fact, based on paganistic beliefs that have been absorbed through the centuries when pagan peoples were &quot;Christianized.&quot; Many of their beliefs were assimilated into the beliefs of the church to facilitate bringing them into the faith. I cannot fault many of Mr White's assertions at all.What I can fault is how Mr White delivers those assertions, which relates to items number two and three. Mr White, in this work, will often begin discussing the paganism of a belief and then start rambling on about something else right in the middle of the discussion. He usually ends each ramble with the assertion that we must return to Torah, as if saying it over and over will cause the reader to do so, as opposed to outlining each belief and then, at the end, asserting that we should return to Torah in one concise, intelligible argument. Also, in several places, he will stop what he is talking about and insert an illustration that is completely independent of his topic and poke fun at another belief, making glib remarks and witticisms. At times, I felt as I was being made fun of for ever believing these paganistic rituals had anything to do with Christianity. As an educated man (with a degree in History), I see this as bad scholarship. Most works that try to be scholarly do so by refuting what is believed to be wrong without making fun of those who believe that wrong. Mr White, in my opinion, does not seem to understand that. He wishes to be taken seriously, yet does not organize his work in a concise, intelligent way that leaves someone seeking the &quot;truth&quot; with the idea that he possesses it.I have read C.J. Koster's Come Out of Her, My People and can attest to the fact that it is the better read for people who wish to know the facts behind the pagan origins of Christian customs and beliefs. Mr Koster carefully annotated his work and gave references on almost every page. There is never any doubt as to where he received his information and we are never told to &quot;go look it up&quot; in some dictionary or encyclopedia. He tells us exactly which work to look in and see for ourselves.I would recommend Mr White's book, but only after reading Mr Koster's first and getting the facts behind some of the pagan customs. Then, and only then, does Mr White's book start making sense."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"This book is one of the most informative books out there on how debase and 'lost' our society has become. Looking beyond the poor layout and the small font (I am a proficient reader and this book 'bogged' me down due to the layout and font size, sometimes causing me to loose the train of thought.)Those are the absolute only downsides to this book. I had come across most of the Truth's presented in the book prior to reading it while doing some research into calanders and how/why we keep time the way we do, being a leap year and all it is obvious our Gregorian calander is faulty and not the means of keeping time. Nor is it the means our Creator established.This book give a thorough presentation of the facts and history of our common practices. It may offend some, but only those who do not want to accept the Truth, and desire to keep those things they have become accustomed to. I recommend than anyone who claims to be a 'believer' or understands they were created, needs to read this book."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"Lew White's Fossilized customs is a start for many people who would like to know the history of some of the pagan religious practices in the Christian world. Before reading this book much of what he presents I found by way of encyclopedias, dictionaries, and various other library books.After learning Hebrew and Aramaic, traveling to Israel, and doing my own research I will say that there are several areas of this book that I disagree with. I agree with the fact that Christianity has a lot of paganism involved in it, the same history of Christianity's pagan origin is documented in this and other such books. I disagree in certain areas of this books theology especially surrounding the Name of Elohim (for those who don't know God in English is often used as a translation for the Hebrew words El, Elohim, Eloah, Elah, etc), my reasons are listed below.The book like some others of its type has some incorrect conclusions about how amongst Jews and Israelis pronunciation of The Name of Elohim became uncertain. Jewish and Samaritan sources both show the process by which The Name of Elohim became uncertain because of 1) corrupt Kohanim after the death of Shimon HaTzadiq around 3 BCE, 2) concern that the corrupt times would cause people to disrespect Elohim 3) loss of the First and Second Temples 4) the social-religious changes that took place after the Roman conquest and the loss of a central Israeli consul.Most Jews have a plithera of sources on where to find information on the theory's of what the Name of Elohim is, the issue in the Jewish world is that we are not willing to call The Creator by a name that is not certain. When the time is right The Creator will reveal it with 100% certainty. The Samaritans also have a similar understanding that until certain things in the land of Israel is restored the Name of the Creator will remain uncertain. 90% of Jewish bibles with commentaries discuss the issue of the pronunciation of Yod-Hey-Waw-Hey and discuss in detail all the theories on this, so it is not a complete unknown.If a person learns Hebrew they can easily investigate every possible theory and find the ones that based on Hebrew make sense, yet the exact pronunciation could have been anything since there are no clear document witnesses from the First Commonwealth of Israel i.e. Moses until the Babylonian exile that have survived in some filtered form whether the filter be time or other author. 95% of the information on The Name of The Creator comes from the 2nd Temple period, which is somewhat of an uncertain period. Also, ancient Hebrew as well as a number of Semitic languages had no vowels, and only a few Jewish communities from the Middle East are believed to have maintianed the most accurate dialect of ancient Hebrew.Also the book does not take into account 1st cent to 8th cent. sources from Jewish and Samaritan communities from the Middle East. Things of a Jewish nature in the book are mainly sourced from English translations of Northern European texts. Yet, as mentioned before this book is primarily for those who come from certain areas of the Christian world.So of course the appeal of books like this is often with people who are disconnected from or are on the verge of leaving Christianity, and I don't fault that as I agree that Christianity has a lot of incorrect and pagan issues.I would make the following suggestions to anyone looking into things like this and those who have purchased and will purchase this book.1) I must first say that the best first step a person should take is to learn the Hebrew language for themselves.2) Travel to Israel and research the events mentioned in the Bible for yourself.The problem that comes up with books like this is that people rely on it as if is 100% fact end up concentrating on what is pagan instead of concentrating on what the Hebrew and Aramaic texts say about a true grounded relationship with Elohim. Using Isaiah 8:20 as a guide and doing your own research on what is Scripture based leads to a better alternative than concentrating on what is pagan.So if you purchase this book, read it with an eye on Hebrew, Aramaic, archeology, and travel to Israel as being the ultimate judge and jury. If you read a book like this and you never learn Hebrew or Aramaic, and you know more about paganism than you do the languages and archeology of the Scriptures then you are still in the Babylon the author hopes you will leave."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"I read Fossilized Customs November 2002. It is now November 2003. I agreed with everything said except for a couple of things that I struggled with. I just couldn't accept the fact that we ought to be keeping the Torah as believers in Yahushua. I struggled over this issue for an entire year, wrestling with this question daily and seeking the truth.I understand now that obedience to the perfect Torah is not a salvation issue,but should be a natural response to the grace we have received.We have done away with Christmas, Easter, and all other pagan influences in our lives. This book has changed my life, and I am also grateful to have the Scriptures in its unadulterated form. I have been distributing this book to people who have been undeniably set in my path looking for truth.

Are we truly \\"set apart\\". I personally researched many of the topics and found them to be true.I also had the oppurtunity to visit a Roman Catholic Church(Grace Cathedral) while visiting San Francisco and saw many of the topics in the book staring back at me. It was like being on a field trip."},{"Title":"Fossilized Customs","review":"I am almost done reading this book.Many of the things that Mr. White brings out in regards to present customs within our culture today are things that I have been familiar with over the past ten years.I have found this book to be at times very helpful and then at other times, I get bogged down in his style of writting.He tends to leave off in the middle of one topic and go forward on another.He doesn't connect the two or seperate them entirely.What is good about this book is that for anyone seeking the truth about our Lord and Savior he gives good sound fact. I agree with one other person here who said that footnotes would have been more helpful then just being told &quot;Look it up&quot;! And he could have left out poking fun at other people's belief's.They may be wrong,but if a person truly believes they are following Truth,it is not for one of Christ's own to make fun of that person.Overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is beginning to dig out these truths,but would encourage you to keep searching the scriptures,praying,and seeking solid fact in historical writtings also.I am encouraged to keep reading and from what others have shared on this site,have found other books that I wish to read on this subject.I appreciate that we are given the space to write reviews here on books at Amazon!

The bride would do well to help ready herself by reading Fossilized Customs by Lew White.In Dueteronomy 12:28-32 the Ancient of Days specifically told us not to mimmick any customs, traditions or styles from the heathen people to use in our worship because He hates it. Unfortunately, most of the Judeo-Christian world has done exactly what He has commanded us not to do! The sad thing is that many people don't know that they are doing anything wrong since they have been blindly following some of these customs for nearly 2000 years!Fossilized Customs unveils familiar practices and traditions that many know and adore that are steeped in paganism and do not honor the Most High. &quot;You transgress His commandments by your tradition&quot;.

Just as there were &quot;no wrong notes on Monk's piano, there are no wrong words in this marvelously creative book by Chris Raschka. Inspiried by the first jazzman to cultivate a goatee and by Monk's composition, 'Misterioso', Raschka has approached this picture-book from a right angle, similar to how Monk titled his head as he 'crushed' out his muisc on the piano. Words, music, and color run up-and-down the pages like Monk's enormous hands, hitting al 12 keys at once. Young readers will enjoy the challenge of trying to decode the phonetic-like presentation of words that reverberate page-by-page across colorful grids reminiscent of a Paul Klee drawing. Seasoned jazz lovers (like me) will marvel at how Raschka has caught the musical magic of Thelonious Sphere Monk as he might have 'sounded with words and a brush' jamming with Charlie (Yardbird) Parker at Minton's Playhouse (New York) in 1937. I have used this book many times to show teachers the power of interactive read-alouds to create higher levels of understanding. With black shades on and Monk's music playing in the background, children delight in a unique demonstration of how language, art, color, and hyphenated text work together to tell a wonderful story about the music of freedom....Jazz.

I read this to a third grade music class. The students commented that the words were placed on the page like notes on a music staff. They also noticed that the size of the words changed throughout the book, perhaps suggesting the dynamics in his music. Although the book doesn't share specific factual information about Thelonious Monk, it is fun to read. I would recommend it for all students and music lovers alike. As a music teacher, I really enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Thelonious","review":"I was skeptical about this when I picked it up from the library. My 6 and 3 year olds absolutely loved it. The way the words were scattered over the page made it impossible not to read it rhythmically! We read it months ago, and still, every time someone says the word \\"mysterious,\\" they start chanting the words of the book. Raschka has done it again!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Thelonious","review":"Chris Raschka is the absolute master of high-concept. His abstract conceptions would seema perfect match for the perfect dissonance of Thenonious Monk, another artist who mastered the abstract and the unconventional...who merged sound and sight in his own iconoclastic fashion. One of Monk's first albums is \\"Brilliant Corners,\\" and you can hear those cuts and angles throughout.Raschka is brilliant in his imaginative construction of this CD/book combination, but the dilemma is whether this is a book for kids or adults. It's so mathematical, richly visual, and simultaneously linear and non-linear that it's a challenging read at almost every age.Here's the concept: Arrange adjoining squares that cover the page from toip to bottom, and left to right...like a checkerboard. IN the vertical dimension (i.e., down the page from top to bottom) the boxes represent the eight descending notes (do, re, me, anyone?) of the Western scale, and scanning from left to right is how we read both books and music. Raschka made up a very Monkian (to my mind) lyric to the tune \\"Mysterioso,\\" and places each word in a square that follows the music, both vertically (do, re, mi), and horizontally--following the melody of the song. As they say, it's easy once you learn it.FOrtunately, Mr. Raschka is a kind teacher, and he includes the singing of his lyric on the CD. ONe follows the song, matching the words and their high/low sound to the words spread higher and low, left to right, on the page. The first track is done very slowly, mkaing it fairly easy to follow (after a few tries); the second time matches the actual tempo of the \\"Mysterioso\\" excerpt. Raschka also includes some introductory personal observations about jazz, and then wraps it up with a full live recording of Monk in the late 50's. If you don't like Monk, you;'re not going to like this book.But, let's say you do like Monk...or perhaps you've never heard of him but you're an adventurous soul. I think you'er going to love this book, and especially the music, if you have an open mind, have liked some very original music in the past, and love modern art. That's if you;re an adult, reading to yourself.If you're reading to a kid, I have a few suggestions to maximize their comprehension, and, more importantly, their enjoyment. I hope I don't sound patronizing; I know that YOU know your child and I don't--but take five and see what you thinik. If you love this book, but think your age 3 to 11 (approximately) audience won't understand it, at least communicate your enthusiasm. Attitude over content! Perhpas if the child is a little older, or has some real proclivities towards abstract thinking, patiently, slowly, show how Raschka has matched words to music in two dimensions. If the child is younger, perhaps point out the little pictures of Monk and other squaranalia placed on the page, enjoy the colors, sing along with the record, make your own pattern of colored squares, and just...as they say...IMPROVISE. That's what Monk did."},{"Title":"Mysterious Thelonious","review":"One wouldn't think it possible, but Raschka has recreated Monk's \\"Misterioso\\" into a beautiful synthesis of color and word by matching the 12 musical notes of the chromatic scale to the 12 values of the color wheel, and repeating word phrases with slight variations, as with Monk's playing."},{"Title":"Mysterious Thelonious","review":"Well, as a Monk fan, I had to snatch this up from my library for-sale rack for $1, and as I was reading it, I was very pleased with myself when I realized that the book is meant to be read to the tune of \\"Mysterioso.\\" The arrangement of the words on the page correspond directly with the melody. I think whenever I have a child, I will sing this book to her.2 and a half years later... I read/sang this to my 22 month-old son last night, and he made me read it 3 more times.

Most of these stories were new to me, but they're short (the book is just under 200 pages, with the intro) and for the most part just aren't as good as his other works. Supposedly these are all mystery stories, having some sort of 'twist' at the end. Sometimes it comes off really well; sometimes it seems forced.So, I'd say it's a collection of fairly low-end Ellison stories, with other collections of his works containing much better stories.What's really unfortunate, and I don't know if this is a case with this collection or with this publisher/series, but the book itself suffers from some fairly major editorial issues. It seems that in every other story the word 'in' became the word 'hi.' Less commonly punctuation marks have vanished. In a couple cases letters even vanished, where 'had' becomes 'h l' for example. I don't believe I have a another copy of \\"The Man on the Juice Wagon\\" (it's not in The Essential Ellison: 50, which it shouldn't be anyways), so I can't determine if the two words spoken by Routener are intentional or not. (They are \\"Rggll\\" and \\"Fszl\\" in my copy. Huh?)Overall, this requires me to give this collection 3 of 5 stars. Go grab a copy of Deathbird Stories or The Essential Ellison instead, assuming you don't already have them.

When an old friends asks him to look out for his niece who will be attending college in Boston and who also happens to be one of the freedom fighters who fought to keep him alive, old ghosts and a passion for the young girl (now a woman) return. As she is more comfortable with a gun than high heels, her uncle also asks Liam to help Marisela to act more like a lady. A mix up with her college housing forces the two to share close quarters. Liam, clearly uncomfortable in his role as Henry Higgins, fights his attraction while Marisala challenges him, as she feels the same. Will the journalist keep a cool head or lose himself over the only person who can probably understand what haunts him?A follow up to \\"Forbidden,\\" there is virtually nothing to link the two stories together (no update on Liam's brother Cal and wife Kayla either), other than the main two characters appearing in both books, making it a stand alone novel. This could have been a pretty topical and brief story (as many older Brockmann novels tended to be). Instead, she pulls out all stops, adding intense emotions and fears to the mix, really delving deep into Liam's psych. This is one of Brockmann's better stories and unlike some authors who re-release material, hers is worthy of the paper it's printed on."},{"Title":"Freedom's Price (Loveswept)","review":"7 years ago Liam met Marisala at when he was invited as an investigative reporter by her uncle Santiago, to chase down the story of political corruption in the country of San Sulistiano. She was only 15 at the time, but even then there was an undeniable attraction between the two. Marisala wasn't your typical 15 year old, she was fighting alongside the freedom fighters. But Liam kept his distance because of her age and they became great friends.Liam was eventually taken as a prisoner where he endured torture for 18 long months until Marisala and a group she organized rescued him and helped him heal, physically. Eventually Liam's brother Cal, and friend, Kayla, came to take him home to Boston. It's now 5 years later and Marisala is in Boston to start her freshman year of college, her uncle has asked Liam to take charge of her care and to help her become more refined.Well with a small mistake with her college housing application, Marisala is forced to live under Liam's roof where they discover the tension they experienced years ago, hasn't mellowed.Ever since reading about Liam and Marisala in Kayla and Cal's story,Forbidden, I have been dying to read their story. They kind of remind me of Max and Gina from her Troubleshooters series; the older man with all those pesky morals and codes, the younger woman ruled with her heart and feelings. I loved it. I started reading it with my Sunday morning coffee and had it finished before lunch.My only problem with this story is that we get absolutely no update at all, beyond the mention of a wedding photo, about Kayla and Cal; apparently the brothers aren't too close anymore. ;) Freedom's Price was a very emotional and sexy read, a fantastic way to spend the morning.Cherise Everhard, March 2008"},{"Title":"Freedom's Price (Loveswept)","review":"Suzanne Brockmann is my FAVORITE author. Hands Down. She has been for the last several years, ever since Linda Howard knocked herself off the throne she'd held for about 10 years. However, after reading several of her re-published contemporaries, I've discovered a horrible trend.If it's not part of her \\"Troubleshooters\\" or \\"Seal Team 10\\" series, it's probably not worth reading. I've realized this after reading a number of re-published duds, \\"Freedom's Price\\" being one of them. I'm beginning to realize that I'm going to have to leave these earlier published contemporaries in the bookstore.Still, a boring Brockmann is definitely better than any of the current offers.

It's a light read with \\"hot\\" sex scenes, if you need that sort of thing to enjoy your book, but the plot lacks depth. Both characters struggle with their traumatic memories from the war; their gap in age causes some self-doubt about whether they would be right together. Age gap is overcome . . .

Wonderful reading and an enjoyable story line.I love reading her books."},{"Title":"Freedom's Price (Loveswept)","review":"This is another great Brockmann quickie that although originally published in 1998 and just 229 pages still feels fresh and complete. I'm just loving her older, stand-alone romances which can be finished in an afternoon and give you everything you're looking for in a contemporary romance.FREEDOM'S PRICE is the companion book to FORBIDDEN (which is also great) and here we get the other Bartlett brothers story. We first met Liam when his older (sexy cowboy) brother Cal went all trouble-shooterish and rescued him out of a third world prison. Since then I've been very curious about how Liam's story would unfold. Plus I have a thing for complicated, tortured heroes and after years in prison I knew he was going to be one of those fabulous heroes. I also knew that it would take a very special woman to reach him and in former freedom fighter Marisala, he gets his match.Because of the first book I'd expected Liam's story to be a romantic suspense. So I was a little surprised when Brockmann set this up as a somewhat comedic, category romance with our heroes meeting in Boston and Liam posing as guardian to Marisala while she attends college. Liam and Marisala shared a past in war torn San Salustiano and she was partly responsible for keeping him alive however at the time she was a teenager. I guess I expected their story to revolve around Liam rescuing Marisala from the jungle and in-between dodging bullets and bad guys he'd realize that she was a woman and he loved her--or something like that. Instead they order pizza, go shopping and apartment hunting all the while pretending that they're not attracted to other. What about the war I wondered? What about my tortured hero? Anyways once I came to terms with what this story was going to be about I really enjoyed it (and I still got a tortured hero).Five years have passed since Liam's rescue form the jungle and although his injuries have healed he is still scarred and tormented on the inside. Suffering from nightmares, claustrophobia and writers block this is one journalist on the edge. The last thing he needs is to have the past forced back on him and of all the people to be entrusted with it just had to be Marisala. He's never forgotten the beautiful solider and its all he can do to keep his hands to himself. Of course she's not helping matters, determined that they would make fabulous lovers.Marisala is a fantastic alpha heroine; she's spunky, aggressive and feels that life is worth yelling about unlike Liam who is suffering in silence. Between all the angst there is also a great comedic undertone with Marisala bringing stray dogs and misplaced people into Liam's once tranquil home. The sexual attraction between our couple is palpable however we of course get several misunderstandings before they can find their HEA including a couple of sigh and oh no she/he didn't moments. A recommended read.

What I found interesting is that she knows she's obsessed but seems a bit unsure about what to make of it, but by the end she realizes that it's okay because she knows it all comes from love. There are also lots of hilarious snippets included, top ten lists and even a breakdown of different type of owners I'm proud to say I'm the \\"Raging Neurotic\\".

Read the first chapter, where Billy bowls someone \\"to death\\", and I seriously doubt that you will put the book down. Billy is one of the most memorable characters in William Kennedy's galaxy, moreso than Francis Phelan in my book. Billy is a risk-taker, a guy whose heart is in the right place, and a rough-and-tumble sort that relies on his confidence in the midst of trouble. And these are the qualities that make him the inevitable, although unwilling, middle-man in a kidnapping negotiation.Billy's world of gamblers, drinkers, sharks, corrupt Albany lackies, and broken families is dark and smoky but never despairing or hopeless. And Billy's moral calculus is a bright spot in this otherwise bleak setting. For my money, \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\" is the best of three in the Albany cycle. I found \\"Legs\\" to be slow-going and lacking focus. \\"Ironweed\\" is a sensational book, a close second to this novel, but its plot of two drinkers going from job to job, joint to joint, drink to drink does begin to wear down. \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\" has a good deal of plot tension, moral conflicts, humor, and a wider array of characters. I'm in the minority here, and that's fine, but in my analysis it'sWIN: (by a nose)\\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\"PLACE: \\"Ironweed\\"SHOW: \\"Legs\\""},{"Title":"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game","review":"Billy Phelan is my fave of the great Kennedys' books.

He is a great pool shooter, decent poker player, half-ass bookie and lovely raconteur.He takes the world as it comes and dives in to any and all of it with gusto and guts.Kennedy tosses in illustrative examples of the magic in daily life and the importance of being able to bounce back from those inevitable moments of (temporary!) defeat. All this told in Kennedys fine voice, a voice like that of a chain-smoking angel who can tell a snappy joke or a dazzling blue stretcher. What fun."},{"Title":"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game","review":"Billy Phelan, son of long gone Francis (Ironweed) has become a &quot;man about town&quot; on the streets of Albany. A snappy dresser, willing to participate in, or bet on, any game in town, has found himself caught up in a kidnapping. This isn't just another game and Billy must play the game of his life for his life.Again Kennedy has the talent to make his wide variety of characters true. My advice is to read this book before Flaming Corsage. The whole cast is there."},{"Title":"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game","review":"William Kennedy was born in 1928 in Albany's North End. He was for a time a journalist in Albany, he has lived in or around the city most of his life, and he has written an acclaimed non-fiction work about the city, \\"O Albany!\\" He is more noted as a novelist, however, and most of his fiction also centers on Albany - much as James Joyce wrote about Dublin or Saul Bellow wrote about Chicago. Three of Kennedy's novels from 1975 to 1983 were part of a consciously crafted and presented \\"Albany cycle\\". BILLY PHELAN'S GREATEST GAME (from 1978) is the second of that cycle.The first of the cycle, \\"Legs\\", focused more on a celebrated bootlegger and gangster from the Twenties, Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, than it did on Albany. BILLY PHELAN'S GREATEST GAME, though, truly is about Albany. The present action in the novel all takes place within a few days in October 1938, and it revolves around the kidnapping for ransom of the son of one of the three McCall brothers (\\"Albany's own Trinity\\"), who control both the Democratic Party and the rackets, bars, and night life in the city. The ripples from the kidnapping quickly engulf the two principal characters of the novel - Billy Phelan (hustler and player par excellence) and Martin Daugherty (leading journalist for the Albany newspaper). Throughout the novel, both Billy and Martin, in their own ways, wrestle with the question: \\"Was it possible to escape the stereotypes and be proud of being an Albany Irishman?\\"The portrayal of Irish-Catholic Albany is superb. Similarly excellent is the exploration of the tensions, ambiguities, and ironies of the relations between religions, race and ethnicities, and economic classes. One brief example, from history, concerned an Irish mob killing a Jew in the midst of an anti-draft riot in New York City during the Civil War: \\"It was a moment of monstrous ethnic truth in American history, my friend, the persecuted Irish throwing a persecuted Jew out the window in protest against drafting Irishmen in the Union Army to help liberate the persecuted Negro.\\"But Kennedy tries to do more, including explore the relationship between fathers and sons - or at least the relationship between Billy Phelan and his father Francis, Martin Daugherty and his father Edward, and more generally Abraham and Isaac from Genesis. Kennedy's handling of this theme is less deft, less successful. The love triangle between Edward Daugherty and Melissa Spencer (an actress) and then, years later, between Melissa Spencer and the son Martin Daugherty is just plain weird - sicker than anything my subconscious would ever entertain left to its own devices.Billy Phelan is uncomplicated and a true fictional hero - which, in Kennedy's world, seems to be a man free of hypocrisy. Billy is a student of the world and the world is not going to get the better of him (i.e., he is not a sucker), but in order to stay afloat and stay in the game, Billy Phelan will not cheat or cut corners - he must be true to himself. Martin Daugherty is more of an intellectual, he is much more complex, and (as a consequence?) he is much more susceptible to moral compromise. Billy and Martin share one thing in common (in addition to their strained relationships with their fathers): neither entertains any religious, ethnic, racial, or socioeconomic prejudice -- and is it that which makes each of them somewhat of an outsider among the Albany Irish?Reading the novel is effortless and, overall, the writing is quite good. Kennedy clearly has found his voice. It is not a novel of sustained brilliance, however. Numerous phrases wowed me, but rarely did entire pages. I enjoyed BILLY PHELAN'S GREATEST GAME slightly less than I did \\"Legs\\", but enough to look forward to soon reading \\"Ironweed\\". Four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game","review":"Albany, New York, during the Depression, when mobsters, crooked politicians, and fast-buck artists were in control, is the setting of _Billy Phelan's Greatest Game-, the second in William Kennedy's \\"Albany cycle.\\" With some of the same characters appearing in the earlier _Legs_, and later appearing in the later Pulitzer Prize-winning novel _Ironweed_, this novel is a huge step forward for Kennedy. His ability to define character, create suspense, and explore major themes affecting fathers and sons and their values is far more sophisticated here than in _Legs_, the story of mobster Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond.In a sensational opening scene young Billy Phelan, part-time bookie and small-time card-player and gambler, is bowling the string of his life--two strikes away from a perfect score. The unexpected conclusion of the match, and its consequences for his opponent, produce a kind of metaphor for life in this era: Everyone lives on the edge, no one knows when disaster will strike, and there's not much anyone can do about it. Billy, whose father disappeared when he was young, is doing the best he can, \\"honoring\\" those he must \\"honor,\\" helping his mother and sister, and acquiring a local reputation as a \\"good guy,\\" taking bets and paying off, and not straying far from home.When one of his acquaintances, Charlie MacCall, the son and nephew of two local pols, is kidnapped, Billy is asked to monitor the activities of one of the men with whom he plays cards, a man suspected of involvement in the kidnapping. Not a \\"stoolie,\\" Billy faces a crisis of conscience. The reappearance of his father, an alcoholic who \\"helps\\" people who can help him, adds to his dilemma, since he counsels cooperation. Martin Daugherty, a newspaper columnist, offers a more mature view while commenting on the political and social aspects of the kidnapping of Charlie MacCall.Whereas _Legs_ is a fairly straightforward biographical novel, this novel is far more complex. Numerous sets of fathers and sons, all of whom have intergenerational problems, reveal the changing morality of Depression-era Albany. Billy's moral code is more stringent than his father's, Martin Daugherty's son is studying for the priesthood (to his dismay), and the kidnapped Charlie MacCall is isolated from the political machine of his father and uncle. An outstanding novel which has not received its due recognition, this is a carefully crafted novel with well developed themes, dramatic dialogue, and grounding in setting that is rare in modern fiction. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game","review":"This is the second of the Kennedy books I have read. I liked 'Ironweed' much better. True, this one has a great opening scene in which there is a head- on- head bowling match related with great suspense and pizzazz. Billy takes on a serious cheap character named Streck. Each one has his own backer. Streck's is Charlie McCall a scion of the family that runs Albany political life. Billy Phelan's is Morrie Berman, a small- time Jewish hood who has sympathy for the fatherless Phelan. The bowling match and especially its aftermath takes a surprising and violent turn, in typical Kennedy style.At the end of the novel Billy Phelan who has stood by his principles and is not a stoolie finds himself ostracized.All in all this is a tough realistic work, with sharp dialect and real humor.If I did not go for it as much as I went for the 'Ironweed' book it is I believe because the violence of the whole thing, the world and the people in it, come to finally turn me off. As I see it Kennedy is a kind of more realistic, and serious Damon Runyan. But precisely Runyan's gentleness with his characters, his feeling that the oddballs and screwballs of his gambling, sports , crime world are loveable jerks after all is what greatly appeals to me. This is not to say Kennedy does not do a good job in delineating admirable sides of his characters, but rather only anything which goes so swiftly and casually from violence to violence ( even in language)is not my cup of Schaefer's , Budweiser's , Ballantine's Miller's , Molson's or any other Albany beer."},{"Title":"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game","review":"Kennedy's Albany cycle includes a treasure of books on politics and crime in New York's capital city, circa the Depression era. What a find, I thought - a whole series to look forward to! But Billy Phelan left me flat. Despite all the prizes Kennedy has won, and the rave reviews his books seem to have garnered, I simply found this one depressing and not very interesting. I'm certainly into American history, and the Depression offers myriad oppotunities for intriguing stories, but I couldn't get into this one.One drawback is no doubt my fault. So many characters were introduced that I had to keep referring back to set up relationships and actions. This got tiring after a while, so I just gave up, and never finished the book. Beyond that, I didn't think any of the characters, including Billy, were developed sufficiently to give me much insight into their personalities, psychological deficiencies, and motives - or an incentive to continue.The Depression-era underworld is fascinating, but where is Elliott Ness when we need him?"},{"Title":"Lone Star Wedding (Fortunes of Texas)","review":"When I first started reading Lone Star Wedding I was thinking good girl- bad guy.

Among these one finds prominent musicians such as C.M.v. Weber, Gioacchino Rossini and even the very young Franz Liszt, great performers, close friends (e.g. Ferdinand Ries) and short-term visitors. Some of the encounters are well documented, whether some are somewhat controversial - such as the encounters with Bettina Brentano-von Arnim (as described in her letters to Goethe). Some of the material in this book is directly taken from Thayer's, and some of it from other sources. The documents shed light on the &quot;visible&quot; aspects of Beethoven the man, the composer and the performer. The writing, of course, is very subjective, however there's enough material through which one can construct a (very partial) view of Beethoven's personality. What one can not find in this book is a window to the mind of the creative genius that Beethoven was. Yes, some evidence is given as to the practical aspects of his writing - the famous notebook and the walks in the woods and so on, but for all the information given by these observers - the great riddle of how does the creative mind transform scattered musical ideas into a masterpiece - well, that will remain a mistery. Nevertheless - there's enough interesting information (in addition to the repetitive descriptions of the messy room and the harsh manners etc.) to make this book a reccomendable addendum to the library of whoever is interested in Beethoven and his work."},{"Title":"Beethoven: Impressions by His Contemporaries (Dover Books on Music)","review":"An excellent short volume with reminiscences from people who met and dealt with the great man.

My attitude turned around quite rapidly because of the writing, the plotting and the fascination of watching the internal debates of French leftists who were coming to terms with the recent impotence of their nation and, consequently, their own irrelevance in the face of the upstart, gauche Americans. (See p. 516 [\\"Admitting that you belong to a fifth rate nation and an outmoded era is not something that you can do overnight.\\"].)I thought that De Beauvior's writing - or at least this translation - was excellent. The sentences were fairly simple and direct, and there were frequent instances where de Beauvior's observations were charming. For example, after Nadine, the daughter of Anne Dubrieulh - the first person narrator/de Beauvior figure - joins the Communist Party, Anne observes that \\"[Nadine] soon began examining all my acts and words in the light of historical materialism.\\" (p. 197.)Kids will do that.The plotting is first-rate. De Beauvior uses a technique where she employs two perspectival characters -Henri Perron and Anne Dubrieulh. When Henri Perron - the Albert Camus figure - is the central character, the story is narrated in the third person; when Anne Dubrieulh is the central character, the story moves to a first person narrative. The change in writing perspective is interesting because de Beauvior will sometimes \\"loop back\\" to cover scenes and times that Henri had previously narrated, and we see the same scene told from Anne's perspective.The soap opera of the book focuses on Henri and Anne's interactions with other people. Henri is the editor/publisher/co-owner of a newspaper started under the Resistance named L'Espoir (the \\"Hope.\\") Henri is married to Paula, who he seems to be fond of but finds her cloying love for him to be stifling him. Henri has to work through the question of whether he will keep L'Espoir an independent Leftist newspaper or be sucked into the plans of Robert Dubrieulh (\\"Dubrieulh\\") - the Jean Paul Sartre analog - to turn L'Espoir into the house propaganda organ of Dubrieulh's political party/movement, the S.R.L, which Dubrieulh conceives as a broad leftist front aligned with the Communist Party, but not Communist. Henri succumbs to the force of Dubrieulh's personality and his apparent submissiveness to Dubrielh, and then regrets that decision when the issue of whether to print an expose about the Soviet death camps splits Dubrieulh and Henri, with Dubrieulh judging that it would be far worse to give aid and comfort to Anti-Communists than to allow the death camps to continue, and Henri having some residual adherence to an idea of a commitment to truth that transcends politics.Through the long political ratiocinations, we see Henri philander. First, he has an affair with the Dubrieulh's eighteen year old daughter, Nadine, then he takes up with a Quisling wanna-be actress - which results in him perjuring himself for a Nazi collaborator - and then he returns to Nadine, who connives at trapping Henri in a marriage by getting pregnant. Nadine goes from Henri to Henri's younger friend Lambert. Lambert goes from a leftist journalist to a right wing newspaperman. Paula, Henri's wife, goes from being a woman in the grips of obsessive compulsion about her husband, to out and out insanity on the same subject, but, fortunately, she is saved by psycho-analysis before the book ends.Anne's story was less interesting and seems to be mostly about Anne's obsession with Anne. Anne has sex with Scriazine - the Arthur Koestler analog - which seems fairly meaningless. She goes to America, plots having sex with the husband of a couple she is staying with, but then meets Lewis, an American writer, with whom she becomes infatuated. She goes on for pages about how wonderful love is, and how great it is to be loved for a woman her age - she is a 39 year old dowager - and then when the embers of passion die down for Lewis, Anne goes on for pages about the hurt of not being loved for a woman her age and contemplates suicide. This material might be pure gold for soap opera lovers, but it did not impress me, largely because I felt that Anne had no clue what she was talking about; her idea of love seemed to be a kind of unexamined narcissism. I, frankly, became annoyed with Anne and puzzled by de Beauvior's approach to feminism. Anne is a psycho-analyst, but she permits herself to be talked to as if she was a child by Lewis. At one point, Lewis advises her that he is \\"going to wind up believing that there is a brain inside that little skull.\\" (p. 477.) As noted in other reviews, based on this book, where the women seem to identify their value in reference to what men they have attached themselves to, it seems that de Beauvior had a rather misogynistic view of her sex.The plotting of all this was excellent. For example, de Beauvior introduces the poison that Anne will contemplate taking at the end of the book in an earlier scene involving Anne and Paula. There is a character named Marie Ange who cons an interview out of Henri, which seems like a puzzling throw-away scene, but the effects of the story published from that interview will be seen at different times throughout the book. Marie Ange pops up unexpectedly at different points. I enjoyed seeing how her life developed over time.However, what caught my interest was the historical value of the book. The book keeps time to historical events - the retreat of the Germans out of France, the surrender of Germany, the use of the Atomic bomb, the Malagasy Uprising of 1947 - and shows the attitude of French intellectuals to these events.A large part of the book is taken up by the problem of the Communist Party. The problem is that Henri's coterie of intellectuals wanted to be Communists but they didn't want to make a full commitment to Communism, much less anything else. They want to have their cake and eat it, too, but the Communists won't permit a left that is not under their control or which refuses to permit itself to be used as patsies. The big issue for non-Communist intellectuals seems to have been whether they should support the United States or the Soviet Union. It seems that for most, there never was a question about supporting the Soviet Union over the United States - of course, they were going to support the Soviet Union (p. 584) - but this allegiance seems to have been more a matter of conformity to class expectation. What we get from reading The Mandarins seems to be that the French Left made most of its decisions based on projecting their attitudes on their enemies. Thus, on a number of different occasions, Henri and his friend describe their fear and loathing about becoming a colony of the United States. This fear and loathing is never expressed in terms of what the Americans will do - except that Americans are somehow uncivilized and uncultured (they will never be able to control themselves with their Atom bomb (p. 241) - but there are descriptions about what it means to be a colonized power, specifically a colony of the French during the Malagasy Uprising. Being a colony of France is not an attractive option. I got the sense that the French intellectuals were basically saying something like, \\"gosh, we know how we act when we are the colonizers, so why should those Americans act any better?\\"Similarly, the only explanation given for the pro-Communist/pro-Soviet attitude is a salve on a guilty conscience, specifically guilt because Henri and his class of intellectuals are rather well-off. We know that they are well-off because they are drinking champagne, going out on the town, living in houses, and not going hungry. When Henri contemplates supporting the Soviet Union - or when he feels guilt or doubt about pointing out that the Soviets have death camps - he explains to himself that only the Soviet Union is likely to feed millions of starving Chinese. According to Henri, \\"American domination meant the perpetual oppression and undernourishment of all Oriental countries.\\" (p. 242.) Of course, the Communists did have a pesky habit of treating people as things. (p. 241 - 242), Henri ratiocinates his way to supporting Communism by asking \\"but what does that mean compared to feeding the hungry?\\" (p. 242.) Nadine, likewise, explains her brief foray into the Communist Party by explaining that if she had been a member of the Communist Party she would not have had to feel guilty about the hungry kids she saw in Portugal during her trip there with Henri. (p. 171.) Likewise, there is a revealing scene where Anne is talking to some Americans about American support for Henry Wallace - FDR's former vice president until he was dumped in favor Harry S Truman because of Wallace's Leftist/Communist sympathies. Anne receives the explanation that \\"[t]hat man will never create a real leftist party. He's just an alibi for people who want to buy themselves a clear conscience cheaply.\\" (p. 553.) A few pages later, Anne is shocked at finding Americans who don't agree that America will become fascist, and she drops the conversation because she realized that they \\"wanted to continue leading their comfortable, carefree, esthetes' life; no argument would dent their genteel egotism\\" (p. 563), which seems like a strange critique coming from a woman flits over to America at whim to have an affair and seems to want nothing more than to continue her comfortable, carefree, esthete's life.Of course, for all their talk of guilt and questions about how they should live, none of these people are ever seen as donating to charity, feeding the poor, or doing anything constructive about the plight of the hungry. Henri does permit himself to be used as a front man for a committee established by the Communist Party to condemn France's mistreatment of rebel politicians after the suppression of the Malagasy Uprising (p. 576), but it is part of the sloth typical of the French intellectual left that this is not a project initiated by Henri. Ironically, Henri agrees to act as the front man by a Communist who slandered him previously. The Communist explains that the slander was \\"just business\\" which he had to do for the Party. Apparently, Henri accepts the idea that party loyalty trumps honesty and good manners.We also see the development of the Anti-Communist Left, which leads some former fellow travellers to move into conservative circles. Scriazzine - a refugee from Eastern Europe - takes the leading oar in attempting to get his colleagues to take an interest in the violation of human rights on the left, mostly to no avail. Lambert gets fed up with the mealy-mouth temporizing of Dubrieulh concerning the thuggishness of the Communist Party and eventually aligns with the conservative writer Volange - about whom it is stipulated that he is somehow unworthy simply because he is conservative and seems to drink too much, albeit he is polite to Henri at social occasions. Because of the Communist Party's own policies, anarchists were forced to choose between communism and \\"Gaullism.\\" (p. 584.)In short, what we see throughout The Mandarins is the demonizing of the Other that existentialism and Sarte were supposed to have condemned. The book exposes the \\"bad faith\\" of the French non-Communist intellectual left who are not living a life of autonomy; they are making decisions based on whether it will antagonize the Communist Party against them or will give aid to people who they feel are even worse than the adherents of philosophy with death camps, i.e., if it will give comfort to the right.In other words, the characters in The Mandarins are nothing if not about \\"buying grace on the cheap\\" rather than choosing to make a tough decision that will force them to break with their comfortable, carefree, esthetes' life and their genteel egotism.Henri is the archetype of this bad faith. Everything he does involves temporizing based on the feelings of other people. He does write an expose of the Soviet death camps, but he waters it down as much as he can. He wants to maintain the autonomy of L'Espoir, but he doesn't want to offend Dubrieulh. He permits himself to commit perjury for his Quisling lover.I wondered throughout the book if this was the message that de Beauvior intended to communicate. I can't imagine that it was, although the bad faith of the left circa World War II is similarly attested to in George Orwell'sHomage to Cataloniawhere it seemed that so long as the form of a socialist society was maintained, the fact that the government was permitting the murder of priests and the burning of churches, and the Communists were using private torture facilities to punish their political enemies was a problem of means, not ends. Ultimately, Henri and Dubrieulh agree that their own temporizing and desire to have their cake and eat it too, to be autonomous heroes of conscience who make sure that they don't fall out of favor with the right sort of people, proves that \\"personal morality just doesn't exist.\\" (p. 518.)Was it de Beauvior's intent to leave a massive text showing the flaws and limitations of the non-communist Marxist worldview? I am not sure, but that seems to be what she did."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"I just finished reading Simone de Behavior's masterpiece, The Mandarins. I have been reading it for a while, the novel weighs in at just over 600 pages. It was very satisfying and I hated to see it end. It holds a special place in my heart as it is populated with the fictional equivalents of some of my favorite literary figures: Simone herself, Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Arthur Koestler, and Nelson Algren. One can easily see why it won France's most prestigious award, The Prix Goncourt. The novel presents a fascinating account of postwar France and how a group of intellectuals struggled in the aftermath trying to rebuild a just society. I particularly liked Simone's stylistic approach to the book, switching from third person in Paris, to first person in Chicago when she described her passionate love affair with Nelson Algren. In the end, we will always have Paris. I remember it well: the Germans wore gray you wore blue."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"The Mandarins is an interesting look into the lives of French intellectuals trying to rebuild the world in a post WWII environment. Beauvoir's account closely follows the lives of Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Nelson Algren. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the lives of French Existentialists, post-WWII French culture, or, just a good read.My favorite part of the novel was Beauvoir's focus on the role of an intellectual. Each character has a different opinion. Each opinion changes over the course of seemingly endless setbacks. Some give in to despair. Others rebel against their circumstances."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"As an admirer of Camus and Sartre I expected a great deal more from Beauvoir touching upon the human condition post-WW 2. Post WW 2 found men like Sartre and Camus in great personal turmoil, at loss to understand the nature of man and the society he found himself living in. What I found in this book were cliches and a great deal of saccharine. Her longwinded descriptions of her love affair with Nelson Algren was terribly boring, and without literary merit. Oh does he love me; he doesn't love me; he does love me, etc. This goes on and on ad nauseum. What insipid nonsense. What it comes down to is this book lacks sou. She did not once in this massive book touch me in a meaningful manner. She did not explore the inner and outer conflicts of an engaged person. I would say that you are wasting your time reading this book."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"I have read a part of The Mandarins by Simone de Beauvoir. The version I am reading is in 3 parts, and I read the first part which has the subtitle: Anne. The Mandarins is a roman-&agrave;-clef which describes the intellectual left-wing millieu in post WW2 Paris. The central character of the account is \\"Henri\\" which is considered to be Albert Camus. It's interesting to see the left-wing movement at this place and time. All the people in the millieu continously suffer bad conscience because many of their political friends died in the resistance and in concentration camps inflicted by the Nazis and Fascists during WW2, so they feel somehow guilty about still being alive. Henri is the editor of a small newspaper L'espoir (The Hope), but it's difficult for him to stay independent, he needs money for the newspaper to survive. They are several parties who are willing to support him, like the communists or SRL (a liberal, non-Communist political group), but they all want to suppress the independance of L'espoir. Also American agents contact Henri offering him support, but on the condition that he must not write critical about the Portuguese dictator Salazar, because the Americans are negotiating army bases on the Azores with Portugal. Henri is a person asking questions and as he says himself in the novel: That if you continue asking questions the meaningnessless of life eventually stares you in the head. So the great void is lurking all the time in Henri's life. The book somewhat describes a male chauvinsistic millieau. The womans in the book mostly play the role of lovers to often infidel men. Often a young womans insight into the political intellectual affairs of the men goes through the bed. One gets a sense of a young Simone de Beauvoir sitting on the lap of these older intellectual men taking notes for her novel. It's quite interesting to witness the intellectual left-wing at this place and time. The people are quite earnest about their political aims, they see it as a struggle for life and death about the future of the world. The men also feel insulted in their France national pride. During WW2 they had envisioned themselves in a postwar world forming the new world, but then they come to learn that France is just a little part of Europe having little to say to the greater powers of the world like USA and USSR. It's intesting to see the development of movements in history. The socialism somewhat started with philosophers like Marx in the mid 19th century. In the mid 20th century people are still very earnest about their cause. And then you look at left-wing today in Europe, which is a middle-class phenomena, using some of the same phraseology but actually only feeling contempt towards the lower classes of society."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"Salty and frank.....is how an editorial review described DeBeauvoir's story and writing style. I came to the book feeling that a treatise on intellectual life in post WWII Paris would serve me well in regards to expanding my own knowledge in modern theory. And it did. I appreciate the seemingly unabashed look into some of the proposed great thinkers of our century. The intermittent sections of the novel concerning Anne's affair with Lewis, an American writer, however, made the novel come to grinding halts for me. The writing in these sections read like a dime store romance. I sensed DeBeauvoir rushed through these scenes, cram-packing the volatile emotions of the love affair, into prose that sadly negated the brilliance I saw in other sections of the novel. When the story picked back up in Paris, I, too, continued my interest in the story. But when she again returned to the American scenes with Lewis, I found myself saying, Simone...! What's wrong? What are you doing? I'm fairly sure the character of Lewis was adapted from a real person, although I don't know his identity. I thought after finishing the book that it is very hard, indeed, to write about the people / scenes of our lives that are most emotionally sensitive to us. As a poet and artist, I've yet to create anything that is STRICTLY autobiographical that I've found up to par with the emotional content the subjects evoke. I wonder if this wasn't the case with DeBeauvoir. I do, however, resepct the book. It's hard for me not to admire the intelligence I do see in a great deal of DeBeauvoir's writing."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"&quot;The Madarins&quot; won the Priz Goncourt, FRance's highest literary award. Can one really give an award to a novel? The winner of a race is usually easy to spot, but how can a novel win an award? In the case of The Mandarins, the merit may have been due to the depiction of the political fragmentation of France immediately after the War. Simone de Beauvoir was bitterly disappointed that France did not emerge as an authentic world power with the coming of peace. The division within the country, however, was more painful to her than France's diminished stature. During the War, some of the factionalism of that country with more than 260 kinds of cheese abated somewhat, but peace meant a return to acrimony. Most of Simone's fiction is based on her life and the people in it. However, no character is ever a one-to-one representation of any individual. To say that the fictional Anne is Simone and Anne's husband is Jean-Paul Sartre is to over-simplify for Simone invested some of her personality traits in both characters. The correspondance between Anne and Simone is greatest when Anne falls in love with the American known as Lewis. (Lcarver of Florida thought this was the weakest part of the novel and I heartily disagree. I knew Nelson Algren. I think Simone wanted to love him but there were many reasons why she never fully allowed herself that luxury.) Once Anne meets Lewis, Simone's writing becomes freer and more relaxed. Simone desperately needed an editor, someone who would have sent the manuscript for the Mandarins back to her with orders to tighten. It may have been that by the time she wrote The Mandarins, she was an embryonic sacred monster. One of my criticism's of Simone as a novelist is her 19th century habit of acting as the omniescent author. It is annoying when Anne smiles knowingly or Lewis nods sleepily. The young Simone (aged 10) read and admired Louisa May Alcott -- who had more in common with Simone than most Americans might suppose -- and Louisa loved melodrama. So did Simone. In fact, her novel, &quot;She Came to Stay,&quot; has been criticized as being melodramatic. Toril Moi, who has written a study of Simone called &quot;The Making of an Intellectual Woman,&quot; says that book is melodramatic because existentialism is a melodramatic philosophy. There is more than a bit of melodrama to The Mandarins. It is a shame that the fine writing of which Simone was capable -- America Day by Day and Force of Circumstance -- didn't transfer to her novels."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"There are plenty of great books and films about the squalor of life during wartime, and even more about shellshocked soldiers coming to grips with life during peacetime. But surprisingly few novels deal with civilians faced with the task of rebuilding the devastated world around them. The Mandarins would have to be at the top of that very short list. Most critics, here and elsewhere, have tended to focus on the book as Beauvoir's record of her affair with Nelson Algren, but like all great artists, Beauvoir transforms the raw material of her life into something far more profound and encompassing, especially as it is played out against the grand, ruined backdrop of postwar Paris. The resulting book succeeds on so many levels: as roman a clef (Camus, Sartre, Koestler, and obviously Algren all feature prominently), as novel of ideas (of the &quot;where do we go from here?&quot; variety), as a love story (really two love stories--we can't forget Henri/Camus, whose story takes up half the book!), as a Jamesian exploration of brash New World vs. exhausted Old World culture, and finally as a portrait of an intelligent, civilized woman wrestling with her darkest impulses in the wake of Europe's darkest moment.Is the book overly long? Probably. Melodramatic? At times. Too cluttered with phrases of the &quot;smiled knowingly&quot; variety? Without a doubt. But it's redeemed time and again by the keen intelligence Beauvoir brings to bear on her characters and herself. For days after I put the book down, I found myself literally pining for the company of Anne, Lewis and Henri. Is there any greater testament to a novel than that?"},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"The reason that I love Simone so much is defined in this book. What happens when you live with atrocities? What happens when you have to see lives terribly torn apart by evil? What can a person do?DeBeauvior takes these questions and makes them human, and gives hope to our world. But, with any great existentialist thinker, makes the point that living is hard. To exist well we must make choices and be able to live with them. All of the characters in this book show the angst and chaos of war. How they are able to live with each other and themselves is displayed with amazing depth and insight. The complexities of women are shown vividly - especially if you have read The Second Sex. Each of the woman characters are shown struggling with their societial place as Other, yet, show this trancendence that is even more important to her gender.This is also an incredible demonstration of the power and pain of love. I read this book as a teenager and found that I reread it at least once a year to remind me of the beauty and pain of life. It is a wonderful book about being a woman, and a thinker. I recommend it to anyone who is disturbed about events in this world and how to deal with them."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"De Beauvoir was one of the greatest minds of this century. The sheer force of her intellect is overwhelming, but thankfully she was also an imaginative, honest, and often funny writer. The Mandarins has long been considered her masterpiece, and with good reason. A fictionalized account of a group of intellectuals struggling in postwar Paris, The Mandarins allows us the reader to peer into a world inhabited by fascinating, difficult, confused and life-affirming individuals. The novel deals with issues that still haunt France, indeed all of Western society, today; specifically the choices people made when the world around them became dominated by oppression, fascism, and the suppression of certain freedoms. How does one come to terms with the fact that atrocities occured under one's nose? How much freedom was taken away, and how much was given up voluntarily? Why is responsibility so important? And how does one act responsibly? Though existential in nature, the themes addressed in this book transcend labels. It is a painful struggle to accept one's freedom, and the responsibility it entails. The Mandarins show how different people come to terms with their conditions. The novel becomes all the more juicy because it is based on real people; Anne is de Beauvoir, Henri is Camus, Anne's husband is Sartre, Anne's daughter is de Beauvoir's lover. Apparently, the rich clothes designer who clawed her way to the top and collaberated with the Nazis is based on Coco Channel. De Beauvoir caused quite a stir with the publication of this novel; I imagine she must have ticked off alot of Paris &quot;society&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"Not only was Simone de Beauvoir a greater philosopher than her companion Jean-Paul Sartre, she was also a tremendously skilled writer. Both the philosopher and writer in de Beauvoir find their expression in this autobiographical novel. Although the subject matter (post-WW II France) may at first glance appear dry, some of the greatest minds of this century are captured in this account. Although readers may not be in as fateful positions as the characters in this book, they can relate to the many difficult decisions that the characters have to make, e.g. between personal principles and financial necessity, or the personal dilemmas faced in love and marriage. The Mandarins thus make very engaging reading on several levels. Some readers may want a peek into the private lives of de Beauvoir and Sartre, others may be more concerned about philosophical issues, some may want a slice of social history, and yet others may seek a book that is so well written that it is a joy to read even if one does not care for the subject matter. The Mandarins meets all these requirements. Hats off also to the translator, who has done an exceptionally good job in carrying de Beauvoir's writing skills accross the Atlantic."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"The Mandarins was the book of the month for an expat book club based in Moscow, Russia. We chose the book for the following reasons: life and values in post-war France, politics torn between Soviet Russia and communism on the left and the US and capitalism on the right, feminism, intellectualism. What we got was a lively discussion about idealism, returning to life after a war, trying to make sense of values and priorities. Most of us felt a sense of accomplishment by actually finishing the book. It is a formidable read, but worth the effort, less as a novel, but more as a snapshot of a time in which we did not live, but with elements of our current life in post-Soviet Russia still as relevant today as they were 60 years ago."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"My reactions to Simone's massive novel about life with J.P. Sartre, Albert Camus, and Nelson Algren are violently mixed. It's fascinating to read about an era where prize-winning novelists were resistance fighters and political organizers, and though they're continually bemoaning their powerlessness, I'm amazed by how much what they do and say matters in their vanished world. On the other hand, it's discouraging the way Simone turns Sartre into a plaster saint, and Camus into a heroic godlike creature every woman desires. The big revelation this novel delivers is how focused on men the author, a feminist icon, was, and how hostile she is to all women other than herself. It wasn't just the era she lived in, because Colette, born a generation before Simone, wrote many warm and appreciative portraits of women, and didn't delude herself about the flaws in the characters of the men she loved.One of the philosophical preoccupations of the novel is Sartre's idea of \\"Bad Faith\\", which as I interpret it, is the creation of a morality or an ideology that protects us from the anxiety of having to make choices about our life. The Camus character in the novel is continually struggling with one anguished choice after the next about freedom, betrayal, life and death, but the choices of the women are limited to choices between one man and another. And even then, the choices about when to end the love affairs are almost always made by the men. Perhaps Simone's bad faith about the inability of women to be happy without being the acolytes of men is what makes her style pedantic and turgid, resembling James Michener far more than her literary predecessor, the clear-eyed and elegant Colette, so that the novel is slow going, relying on the basic vitality of the times and the characters to pull you along."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"I will allow the reader an oppurtunity to read through some quotes within The Mandarins, so that s/he will decide whether the book is worthwhile or not...\\" [...] to be no one, all things considered, is sthg of a privilege [...]\\"\\" No I shan't meet death today.

Amid uncertainty, they try -- some more successfully than others -- to redefine their politics and personal relationships as peace descends. The complex story is told mostly in third person narrative, punctuated every few chapters by accounts of people and events through the eyes of Anne, a therapist long-married to an older, prominent intellectual and Resistance fighter and mother to a young woman just entering adulthood. (The character of Anne's husband, Robert, is based on Jean-Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir's long-time companion.) This group of writers, fighters, mentors and philosophers struggle with how to remain faithful to the values for which they had so valiantly fought during the war.In addition to reckoning with political and intellectual complexities, every character in the book is coping with issues of personal attachment and integrity. Like many existential novels, this is a book about making choices and keeping commitments -- to ideas, to political values, to family and love.The love affairs among the characters, young and old, are beautiful, heartbreaking and real. Over many years, Anne and Robert have built a comfortable and deeply respectful relationship that remains solid despite the enotional and ideological chaos that surrounds them. Their daughter, having come of age during the war, turns to impetuous and self-destructive behavior as she mourns the loss of her first love in the war. Especially poignant is de Beauvoir's depiction of obsessional love and madness in Paula, whose devotion to the ethically-challenged Henri is rewarded by deception and neglect.This novel represents story-telling at its best -- brilliantly capturing time, place, character and the philosophical underpinnings of existentialism. The issues the author tackles and the characters she creates are as meaningful to us today as they were to her fifty years ago"},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"A 500 page novel but once I picked it up, I couldn't stop. Set in post-far France, it the story of half-a-dozen characters. Their lives and ideas after war. I find politics boring but for the first time I found the political upheaval presented in such an intelligent fashion. Another aspect I liked was Beauvoir's ability to deal with the male characters in as much efficient way as she handled her women.Simone de Beauvoir, a French essayist and novelist, was a leading feminist and a proponent of existentialism. Her philosophical view closely resembled that of Jean Paul Sartre, a lifelong associate. The story goes that she was very beautiful (besides being a very intelligent woman) and Sartre rather ugly and yet theirs was a great union. The existential dilemma is the central theme of her works, but her perspective ranges from the autobiographical to the historical. The Mandarins,is supposedly, a fictionalized account of Jean Paul Sartre and his existentialist circle.Remember to pick it up when you have some time at hand or else you will find yourself sleepwalking at work after staying up with the book the whole night."},{"Title":"The Mandarins: A novel","review":"The quality of writing was doubtless a little undermined by its English translation (probably through no fault of the translator), and so in my opinion deserves little comment - the style can be a little dry at times, though not exactly boring. There are some wonderful descriptions, and neither did I find them overly dramatised, but again I found myself questioning them as to their pros and cons, wondering what they had lost or gained going through the translation process.I knew nothing about de Beauvoir's relationships to the characters she wrote about, and their connections to the people she knew (mine being an archaic charity shop edition with an extremely non-commital and uninformative blurb). In all events, I was happily surprised by the scope and emotion she conveyed with the book, despite its aforementioned dry tone. Somewhat like Lessing's Shikasta, I felt it to be one of those massively long pieces which led quite slowly to the finale, and yet at the same time the slowness was important to lay the seed of thought in my head of what she was trying to tell the reader.This review is probably a bit of a turn-off to prospective readers, but in actuality the book is a stunning achievement, and well worth reading for those ignorant people like me who know nothing about post-WWII France, the intellectuals, etc. Simone gives us all of this information, but in a truly poetic and retrospective manner, portraying the uncertanties, political, moral and emotional dilemmas that these intelligent people had to justify to themselves, with realistic exactitude.Additionally, she not only gives us these clever trains of thought, but portrays accurately the treacherous uncertainty of involving oneself in politics, faced with a world of high society idiots who clasp the strings of power, being from the viewpoint of intelligent, but innefectual revolutionaries. This chilling message she conveyed, to me resonated icily with the present day; a double echo from what it was then, and what it still is today - perhaps a comment on the human condition in a big world?"},{"Title":"Diplomatic Immunity","review":"\\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" is a right-wing domestic thriller with some amateurish qualities but also some genuine shoot-em-up, track-em-down excitement.

I got hold of this book from our college library. The way Gleason presented topics form this course was brilliant. Although this course is not a basic calculus course, this is a must for mathematics majors who wish to pursue masters and doctorate degrees in the future. This book is recommended for students with a more mathematical maturity than that afforded by the usual freshman-sophomore courses in calculus. And one excellent way to gain such maturity is through a beginning course in linear algebra, although it is not a pre-requisite for the book, but of an advantage. This book tackles the &quot;structure&quot; of calculus, wherein theorems are presented in much greater depths and goes &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of the theorems in calculus.

It contained the translation of some of Lear's best rhymes rendered in Italian. Each written page was matched by a drawing which pictured the main character of the limerick, in a grotesque and funny way, in garish colours. It was to my mind a small masterwork. We laughed so much at night looking at the book and reading the absurd descriptions of incredible creatures, that those memories are among the sweetest of that period long past. And after so many years I just came to believe that those obstreperous heteroclite old men and women (most are old, seldom are they young) are after all the most realistic one could describe, as this world is just so topsy turvy that what at first may seem most absurd is just the most realistic of the pictures of what exists, body and soul, under a slim cover of apparent seriousness.

The descriptions of life in London before the construction of a sewage system make facinating, if terrifying, reading.The good thing about this book is that is is basically a very easy read. Although it is about a civil engineer, and although it concentrates very much on the engineering aspects of Bazalgette's life, it is entirely non-technical and an excellent choice for the general reader. Anyone with a general interest in public health, Victorian London, urban development or municipal politics will find it easy to read and a good starting point for further reading or research.One of the points which comes out of the book is how slow public health reforms are to come about - you have to kick up a pretty big stink before anything happens. Bazalgette was more of a provider of solutions than a public health campaigner, but none the less admirable for that.Today public building in London seems to be a race between Norman Foster and Richard Rogers - I was astonished to learn how many buildings, bridged and other projects in modern London were Bazalgette'. He was a busy and capable man, and his life is a very interesting read."},{"Title":"The Great Stink of London: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the Cleansing of the Victorian Metropolis","review":"Halliday's book tells the story of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, Chief Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works (London's first metropolitan government) from 1856 to 1889.His greatest achievement was building for London a sanitation system of unprecedented scale and complexity. Throughout history, the main cause of death has been the contamination of drinking water by sewage. In particular, cholera spread when the faeces of sufferers contaminated drinking water: cholera epidemics in London killed 6,536 people in 1831-32, 14,137 in 1848-49, and 10,738 in 1853-54.In the long hot summer of 1858, the stench from rotting sewage in the Thames drove MPs from Westminster. The \`Great Stink' forced them, belatedly, to act. Bazalgette was charged with building a system to prevent sewage getting into Londoners' drinking water, which he did. The 1866 cholera epidemic killed 5,596 people in the East End, the sole part of London that had not yet been protected by Bazalgette's intercepting system. After the system was completed, cholera would never again kill Londoners. Bazalgette had turned the Thames from the filthiest to the cleanest metropolitan river in the world and added some twenty years to Londoners' lives.But this was not Bazalgette's only success. He constructed the Victoria, Albert and Chelsea Embankments, where he introduced the use of Portland cement. He laid out Shaftesbury Avenue, Northumberland Avenue, Charing Cross Road, the Embankment Gardens, Battersea Park and Clapham Common. He built the bridges at Hammersmith, Putney and Battersea. He introduced the Woolwich Free Ferry and designed the Blackwall Tunnel.In 1889, the London County Council replaced the Board: Bazalgette's successes had proven the value of local government for great cities. Roy Porter wrote that Bazalgette stands with Wren and Nash \`as one of London's noblest builders'. John Doxat wrote, \\"this superb and farsighted engineer probably did more good, and saved more lives, than any single Victorian public official.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Stink of London: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the Cleansing of the Victorian Metropolis","review":"A fascinating story and worthy tribute to Joseph Bazalgette, an underappreciated Victorina-era engineer responsible not only for designing and overseeing the construction of London's huge sanitary sewer system, but also the construction of Victoria, Chelsea and Albert Embankments, forever changing the face and character of central London. We take so much of our modern cities for granted, not realizing that entire rivers are flowing under the streets, blissfully unaware of the level of vision and committment required to create an infrastructure that provides health and convenience.The writing style is breezy and lucid, although the author has a distracting habit of repetition. Certain factoids, such as &quot;the embankments reclaimed 52 acres of land&quot; are repeated over and over again, and several favorite quotes are repeated at least 3 times.I won't ever look at a modern city the same way."},{"Title":"The Great Stink of London: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the Cleansing of the Victorian Metropolis","review":"While the title implies the book's focus will be London's &quot;Great Stink&quot; of 1858, it is in fact a short biography of the eminent Victorian civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. Less remembered than his fellow engineers Isambard Brunel or Robert Stephenson, Bazalgette was the Chief Engineer of London's Metropolitan Board of Works for some 30 years.During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of the great intercepting sewers of London which effectively removed the recurring threat of cholera from the city even before that disease's transmission mechanism was fully understood. In addition, the great Embankments along the Thames were designed and built by Bazalgette which make the modern waterfront as we know it today. He also built three bridges still standing across the Thames and designed many of the modern thoroughfares of London.This book focuses on the long political battles waged in Parliament, the press, and within the City itself to solve the massive problem of human waste disposal in the world's largest western metropolis of the day. Although ostensibly about a civil engineer, there is not much engineering in the book - making it highly accessible to the layperson. Copious contemporary illustrations out of &quot;Punch&quot; and the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; along with lengthy quotations from &quot;The Times&quot; make the Victorians' view of this smelly problem come to life. It's fortunate that this is not a scratch-and-sniff book.The main chapters include those devoted to the invention of the water closet (a sewage nightmare), cholera and sanitation, and the building of the embankments. Throughout the book, small sidebars give potted biographies of key players and interested parties of the day such as Dickens, W.H. Smith, Gladstone, Dr. John Snow, and others. These are great little tidbits on the people featured in the main narrative and they are liberally sprinkled with caricatures from &quot;Spy&quot;.The book does touch on Bazalgette's early endorsement and use of Portland cement as a technical innovation as well as the quality assurance testing techniques that he enforced during his projects. So engineer, take heart! There are interesting bits for you as well.If dark places under the heart of the metropolis is your area of interest, see also &quot;London Under London&quot; by Richard Trench &amp; Ellis Hillman for sewers, the Tube, and more subterranean passages. And if you simply must have olfactory re-enforcement to imagine the past, try &quot;Victorian Vapours&quot; by Mary J. Dobson."},{"Title":"The Great Stink of London: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the Cleansing of the Victorian Metropolis","review":"My father and I both enjoyed the heck out of this book. If you've ever wanted to learn about the building of a metropolitan sewer system, or get a glimpse of the impossible difficulties of public works, this is a good story.

Here's why:* Coverage of topics in aircraft design is exhaustive. From balancing lift and weight for steady flight, on through off axis forces and moments from running propellers, to 6-dof formulas for aircraft dynamic modes, to how propeller location affects aircraft stability, and on and on. Great for both the beginner and the authority in aircraft.* Often a completely thorough analysis including the minutest effects is presented along with a linearized or simplified method. The simplified analysis is so useful for rapid conceptual design and study of fundamentals, while the detailed analysis gives a complete grasp of the physics and phenomena involved. Plus, in simplifying a complex derivation, the reader is shown which parameters may be safely neglected and which require careful scrutiny, and what is engineering if not intelligently ignoring smaller effects to come up with a reasonable solution to a problem?* The figures! Well thought out and consistent, the figures clearly illustrate the material.* Actual aircraft data is used in the example and homework problems. I have a feel for the performance of several classes of aircraft simply from using this book.* Phillips derives everything, and I mean everything using the fundamental laws of physics as the starting point. A student would be very well served to go through these derivations themselves. Phillips basically shows the student how to learn and how to think mathematically. No shortcuts here. I wish I had learned these things very early on in my own schooling.* Phillips has included experimental data along with rigorous analytical derivation and computer numerical analysis. I believe that all three are necessary for a true understanding of fluid dynamics.The bottom line: Buy and use this book! While it is true that the material is focused on subsonic flight, I work for a large airframer of supersonic aircraft and I find the principles and fundamentals to be extremely useful in my work. Whether you are a student or a professional, if you have an interest in aerodynamics this is THE book to use."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"I am an Aerospace engineer working for the Air Force. While attending the annual AIAA aerospace convention in Reno Nevada, I met a professor from Denmark who raved about the work and research of a professor local to the west, Phillips. This seasoned scholar from Denmark wouldn't miss a session if he found Phillips' name appearing in it. I picked up the \\"Mechanics of Flight\\" which was on display for the first time at that conference. Due to the mountain of topics covered (900+ pages) I can't say that I have read every line of that book but the material I studied was impressive. I've never seen such complete derivations right from F=MA. The explanations are meticulous and thorough. I coded a real-time 6-DOF flight simulator for a midsized RCAV using this book as the main reference. I've never seen such a straightforward explanation of Quaternion algebra. If there were a \\"bible\\" of flight mechanics and dynamics, I would certainly give this my vote over any other in its class."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"This text provides unparalled detail in it's discussion of flight mechanics. It contains clear and concise derivations of underlying equations and has well planned figures and example problems. Subject matter includes static and dynamic stability, propulsion, lifting line theory, 6-dof flight simulation with quaternions, along with many other essential topics. I particularly appreciated the straightforward way in which Phillips applies numerical methods to solving many of the problems. The equations required are located in such a manner as to make it easy to find what you need. Though mainly geared toward subsonic flight, I have found the understanding gained through this book invaluable in the design of supersonic vehicles. This is a great book for students learning the subject for the first time and a must have for engineering professionals and aircraft enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"This book lays out the concepts of aircraft performance and simulation in an exceptionally clear and easy to follow format. There is no wondering how the concepts in each chapter fit together and how they apply to aircraft design or analysis.The formulations for aircraft performance are very robust and provide the reader/student with the formulation of each equation from basic priciples in an easy to understand style.A highlight of the book are the chapters on flight simulation and dynamic stability. The methods presented for 6-dof dynamic stability and quaternion based flight simulation are clearly explained and the examples provided walk the reader through the process of implementing them. These methods are also faster and more accurate than similar methods I have seen used here at NAVAIR, and implement them every time I can into older codes.This book covers every aspect of flight mechanics that the beginning and intermediate student needs to know and does not confuse the reader!!"},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"\\"Mechanics of Flight\\" is an excellent textbook for students of aeronautics as well as an invaluable reference for engineers practicing in aerospace, experimental homebuilders, and pilots having a flare for science. The subject matter is well-organized, thorough in coverage, comprehensively indexed, and has an impressive bibliography. There are numerous worked examples, excellent graphics to illustrate concepts, and many aeronautical/aerodynamic relationships are plotted to demonstrate parametric relationships. Numerical solution techniques are discussed throughout the book and many problems are tailored for a programmed solution on a digital computer. Although this is a textbook, and the concepts are demonstrated using rigorous mathematical derivations, considerable insight into the mechanics of flight can be gained by simply reading the text, studying the figures and absorbing the numerous tips and rules of thumb. The reader is taken from overviews of aerodynamics and propulsion in the first two chapters through aircraft performance, aircraft controls and maneuverability, static stability and control, aircraft dynamics, handling qualities, and closing with aircraft flight simulation.Prandtl's classical lifting-line method is the basis for much of the aerodynamic theory used in the book. The author uses the method to explore lift and drag for various wing planforms. He further develops the effects of geometric and/or aerodynamic twist and how induced drag is affected. A significant result shown is that there is an optimum washout distribution for any wing planform which will minimize induced drag. The author has also generalized lifting-line theory to allow study of the effects of wing sweep, dihedral and interaction between lifting surfaces. The method is about 4 orders of magnitude faster than panel methods and 6 orders of magnitude faster than CFD solutions. The numerical lifting-line method with parasitic drag included provides a computationally efficient method for preliminary aircraft design.The author has presented a particularly thorough discussion of propeller theory in Chapter 2. This section may be of particular interest to pilots. Fixed-pitch and constant-speed propellers histories are included and their mechanical attributes and efficiency compared. The reader gains considerable insight into how a propeller does its job and how one might select a certain propeller for a particular aircraft and mission. Both Goldstein's vortex theory and the more common propeller momentum theory are developed by the author. He has also shown how momentum theory can be improved by incorporating slipstream rotation. The chapter on aircraft performance also provides practical insight on fuel consumption, endurance, and range. Numerous worked examples show how these parameters change with gross weight and wind, illustrating the mathematical equations with plots to simplify the information. The section on takeoff and landing performance may be of special interest to homebuilders and pilots.The chapters on static stability and trim will also be of interest to the homebuilder. Simplified pitch stability analysis is presented for standard wing-tail and wing-canard combinations, which are useful for preliminary aircraft design as well as an estimate for downwash angle on an aft tail. Many factors affecting pitch stability and their effects are discussed in detail, including the contribution of a running propeller, and its location, on the static stability of an airplane. Lateral stability is treated with equal aplomb and some rules of thumb for aircraft design are provided. Longitudinal-lateral coupling, such as the yawing moment produced by a rotating propeller, is described and the designer alerted to the fact that static stability cannot always be separated into longitudinal and lateral motion.Chapter 7 provides a more general formulation of the rigid-body equations of motion than presented in the preceding chapters. This chapter will thrill the mathematics enthusiast! It starts with a review of mathematical notation and coordinate systems and proceeds to develop Newton's second law for rigid-body dynamics. Ultimately, the nondimensional linearized equations of motion are derived for a symmetric configuration after applying the small disturbance approximation. The last section of this chapter discusses how inertial and gyroscopic coupling come into play if symmetry is relaxed.Linearized longitudinal and lateral dynamics are examined in Chapters 8 and 9 and the eigenvalues obtained from the solution of the eigenvalue problem are related to the phugoid, Dutch roll, etc. Longitudinal-lateral coupling in the equations of motion is addressed by solving the full 12x12 eigen-problem associated with linearized aircraft dynamics. It is shown that a flight condition as simple as turning flight introduces this coupling, which cannot be fully analyzed using the uncoupled equations.I personally found the comprehensive presentation of the quaternion formulation for 6-DOF flight simulation, which is presented in Chapter 11, to be unique, interesting, and understandable. This information is not available in any other single source to the best of my knowledge.It is not possible in this brief space to do justice to the comprehensive coverage of flight mechanics provided by this textbook. The book is rich in aircraft history, modern approaches to classical solution methods and new ways to look at well-founded theories. The only possible shortcoming that I could find was the need to make my way through the challenging mathematics that supports the concepts (not necessarily a bad thing for a textbook). It will be a resource used for many years by students, practicing engineers, experimental homebuilders, pilots, and maybe even model airplane enthusiasts. This book may be destined to become a classic in the field!"},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"Warren Phillips has broken the mold with this book. I am currently a Doctoral candidate in aerospace engineering and I found his use of examples and ability to clearly explain complex topics to be unparalleled in any other text. Myths and misunderstandings about flight mechanics that have propagated down through decades of other texts are disproved or clarified. Dr. Phillips clearly understands and has thoroughly researched each topic that he presents, as the reader is never left in the dark by the ambiguous \\"hand-waiving\\" so common in other texts.For professionals, the exhaustive index and methodical explanations make Mechanics of Flight the ideal reference.For students in mechanical, aeronautical, or aerospace engineering, there has never been available a more student friendly text for learning flight mechanics and flight simulation.For engineering professors, using this book will make teaching any senior or graduate level flight mechanics or flight simulation class easier for you and more enlightening for your students. Additionally, an amazing 592 page solutions manual is available from the publisher!This book is a must buy and I predict that Mechanics of Flight by Warren F. Phillips will soon be recognized by the engineering community as the \\"bible\\" of sub-sonic flight mechanics."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"Sure, Phillips is extremely clear, and cautious to keep us on track when deriving the equations. But what really sets this book apart is the clarity of its structure, which lets you find what you need, and know what to skip, most easily. I always know where I am heading when reading this book.The treats are:- A 25-page index, what a pleasure!- Beautiful, clear figures (an element usually neglected by most)- Real-world examples (think: can you go-around with one engine in a Tomcat?)- A refresher in Aerodynamics in the first chapter.This book is on the top 5 list of my aeronautical engineering collection. I wish every textbook was written this way."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"If you are fascinated by Darrol Stinton's works of art, I think you will enjoy this one as much.It is much more mathematically oriented than the above, be aware, but not as much as to become a geek treatise on flight. It still retains the aviator's view on flight and discusses in much detail the mechanics of it.Maybe a stepping stone towards engineering but definitely useful to be a better pilot. You will find long pages on systems of partial differential equations and all, but the author had the foresight to include a detailed explanation of what he just found out with all those equations. He dissects the final formula for you and tells you exactly what that means for your flying. Superb.If you are looking for a quick guide on how to fly better, look elsewhere. The market is literally flooded with books for the novice/intermediate pilot on what, when and how. As I already said, get this book if Stinton's work left you hungry for more."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"When designing a one-off experimental aircraft, you should start with something like Raymer's 'Simplified Aircraft Design for Homebuilders', and then move on to his textbook or Darrol Stinton's equally informative texts. There are also other good 'general' design books, like Hiscock's 'Design of Light Aircraft' or Pazmany's \\"Light Airplane Design\\". Eventually, though, you'll need to move beyond simpler equations and rules of thumb into more detailed math. Unfortunately, most texts for this phase are either older, hard-to-find texts written in the days of prop planes (eg Perkins-Hage 'Stability and Control', still a must-have classic) or modern textbooks heavy in grad-level math and a focus on advanced-transport/supersonic fighter applications. 'Mechanics of Flight', on the other hand, is one of those few modern textbooks that are as useful for general aviation enthusiasts as for those aiming for a career at Boeing. Yes, there are chapters on turbojet engines and supersonic flow, and yes, you had better be comfortable with engineering mathematics (partial derivatives, matrix math, and the like). However, this author is clearly an engineer first and a mathematician second--he doesn't waste your time proving mathematical theorems, he instead shows the derivation of the math from the physical principles involved in flight. Even though my university engineering courses are a few decades behind me, I had no trouble following the math in this book.For us general aviation folks, there's a wealth of material here. The math for finding exact aerodynamic center and section lift distribution on real wings with taper and twist, and the differences between the approximate solutions and CFD and windtunnel results. A large chapter on propeller theory, and another on detailed aircraft performance (range, thrust required, field length, etc.) The problem sets range from commercial transports to human-powered designs. Most of the rest of the book covers aircraft stability and control, with plenty of clear and descriptive text accompanying the equations. Important results are highlighted in bold face throughout the text. Chapter 10 is particularly valuable in it's coverage of aircraft handling qualities and control response, relating the stability derivatives calculated in earlier chapters to the more qualitative aspects of how the plane 'feels' to the pilot. As another reviewer mentioned, the book ends with a chapter on the equations used for aircraft flight simulation, which is an interesting read even if you don't intend to write your own simulator."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"Having run across several books by several authors concerning the topic of flight mechanics and aircraft performance, Philips \\"Mechanics of Flight\\" is one of the best. Not only does Philips present things logically and systematically, he also has a gift for explaining why things are the way they are- something severely lacking in other literature.While there are many other useful and quite popular flight mechanics texts available, for those looking to expand their library, this is a must-have addition."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Flight","review":"A very thoroughly written book. I found some information on all-flying tails that I haven't found any where else. However, Dr. Phillips uses nomenclature that are not what I call traditional nomenclature.

Coles can say that because he is both a professor at Harvard University, and the author of a Pulitzer Prize - winning series on the spiritual life of children. His life consists of what he once called a &quot;return to the Sermon on the Mount.&quot;This book consists mostly of reflections on people Coles admires, whom he discusses in one of his classes at Harvard. Favorites he features here include people like Dorothy Day, Flannery O'Conner, George Orwell, of course Tolstoy, those who work among the poor, and the some of the poor themselves, whose comments he reports a few paragraphs at a time, and are as interesting as anything by his more famous heroes.

Then came my introduction to his raw, seething historical poems, in _The Holocaust and Hiroshima_. Now, his latest book of poetry, _Outcasts_, brings to mind the photographs of Diane Arbus -- truth encountered without flinching; just, bold and clear. This book contains his stunning poem &quot;Daughter,&quot; the single best poem I've read on the subject of separation. Some of the poems in this book take a more whimsical tone, and the character sketches feel concise and real.

After buying the book and working my way through it I quickly realized how great this book was. Not only does it show you step by step verbally how to do something, but it also has a screen shot of HOW it should look on the screen. For someone who is trying to understand how the program works and where to go to get the options you are looking for this book is for you.

Taking one look I was disappointed because this book didn't offer very much. Half of the stuff discussed in the book I learned by just playing around in the program. There are several books that are better then this one. I even found the tutorial book that comes with the program more helpful. Your better off spending a few extra bucks and getting something with some substance."},{"Title":"3D Studio Max R3 (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"The book itself is well written and does give a VERY general overview of the program, but after reading it, you are left wondering, &quot;Now what?&quot; There are no intermediate to advanced topics discussed in the book such as NURBS and particles, and topics that she does discuss are not explained in detail. At least if she addressed advanced topics, then a novice would know what he CANNOT do based on the information in the book, which is just as important as knowing what you can do.I've found that I must spend a great deal of time tinkering with functions to get them to work at all, such as boolean functions and rendering animation, because the author does not state critical steps necessary to make them work (such as typing the name of the second object in the entry box for bolean functions, or typing a name to save an animation file in the reder dialogue box BEFORE you render it), but which she maybe taking completely for granted. In the classroom, Ms. Matossian could simply mention this to her students when they ask her these simple questions, but a book on fundamentals should be able to stand on its own. Because of such oversights, the book fails to give a beginner a solid foundation. New users (like myself) will find that you will soon have to buy another book that covers both basic an intermediate topics, which I wish I had done in the first place. I was quite frustrated when I found that, after reading the book, I still cannot create a tree, or bevel a chest properly. (For some people, a tree might pass as being a green ball on top of a brown cylinder, but since I am an artist, I refuse to be satisfied with such a kindergarten interpretation of images in reality.) For the sake of simplicity and speed, the book focuses on creating and modifying objects with the mouse, and as an after thought, mentions keyboard entry. Since this is so, the author does not discuss the variables in the modifier roll-outs, so a novice becomes neither proficient with the mouse (because if its inherent lack of accuracy) or the keyboad entry (since it is covered vaguely). This washed out compromising approach is typical of the entire book which leaves the novice feeling powerless to control or modify simple primitives with any degree of accuracy. She also mentions nothing about the steps or thought process necessary to plan even a simple project.Realistically, the purpose of such books is to serve as perpetual reference material. The author could have gone two ways with this book: she could have covered all topics--including advanced ones--in a general way, or she could have covered the fundamentals in detail. She does neither. As a result, the book quickly makes itself obsolete and will likely collect dust when I find something more comprehensive in dealing with both fundamental and intermediate functions.At least it wasn't too expensive.A final note: customer reviews influence me as to whether or not to buy a book, and because of the high rating, I bought this one. However, for your own protection, I suggest you take reviews by enthusiastic reviewers who have &quot;just started reading&quot; or &quot;haven't yet finished&quot; or &quot;just recieved&quot; a book with a grain of salt. The measure of worth for a reference book is how much you refer to it after you've read it, not how excited you are when it first arrives.Thanks and good luck to you all!"},{"Title":"3D Studio Max R3 (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This book provided a quick overview for someone already familiar with animation using Lightwave.

This worries me just a bit since it seems it should be still useful and thus profitable to print. One answer might be that Mr. Dacey's book has caused some of the exorbitant charges and abuses of probate to disappear (out of embarrassment?).One probate issue which has not disappeared, is the lengthy time(months or years)during which probate proceedings control the assets covered by a will -- assets which the book says it clearly enables you yourself to place in a simple trust so your beneficiaries (or heirs) will have instant and clear title to them at your death.It describes large reductions in transaction costs including tax savings, but it does not, in my opinion, show how to pass assets to your heirs tax-free."},{"Title":"How to Avoid Probate","review":"The two major problems with probate are the lawyers fees which can be excessive and the delay which can be easily be over a year or more.The book can be read in less then an hour.

There are detailed instructions for each type of asset and how to fill out the trust forms.My wife and I put our house in trust, as well as all of my savings accounts and stocks. I preferred to put the forms on word processing. No problem filing the real estate trust with the registry of deeds and no problems with the banks with the savings accounts. No problems anywhere. Every detail is there in the book.I now feel comfortable that my children will receive their assets without any unnecessary cost and on a timely basis."},{"Title":"How to Avoid Probate","review":"Dacey's book should be on your bookshelf, if for no other reason than to show how corrupt the probate system is. The book is excellent and the forms can be copied. Amazon has newer books on living trusts and they have CDs for the forms. To avoid the probate system many wealthy people put their assets into trusts of one kind or another. What's good enough for people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett should be good enough for me.When we moved to Texas in 1981, I asked several people about setting up a living trust. I was assured that unlike some other states, the probate system in Texas was simple and straight forward, and that a living trust was unecessary. Recently the media has had articles on the corrupt probate system in Texas. However as the articles suggest, it is a fair system, anyone who has to deal with the probate system, rich or poor, is apt to to find all/most of the estate going to the lawyers."},{"Title":"Godfrey de Bouillon : Defender of the Holy Sepulchre","review":"A marvelous character study of the main figure of the First Crusade. This tale is told from the second person viewpoint of all the persons close to Godfrey - family, relatives, clergy, fellow soldiers, and even captured enemy. They present a well-rounded view of Godfrey from his birth, upbringing, and then to death. The emphasis is on the (Christian) influences in Godfrey's life that led him to devote his life to leading a crusade, which he certainly did not have to do.Not having any background on the crusades except for what I vaguely remember from high school, this provided a quick overview. The focus is on the people and what it took to move a mass of people over a two year period. Although fighting is mentioned, there are no lengthy, gory detailed fight scenes."},{"Title":"Godfrey de Bouillon : Defender of the Holy Sepulchre","review":"Tozer continues in the footsteps of his grandfather AW Tozer and has writen a book worthy of his name.

I really enjoyed how this one played out. The illustrations are as good as you would expect from a van alsburg book, especially well done are the peoples facial expressions.This is a book i would definately recomend to a friend, not nessesarily a younger reader but preferably someone who can read fairly well, its somewhere in between a chapter book and an easy reader."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"Bibot, the French Dentist, is a mean cold-hearted man. He treats his small dog Marcel badly. He does not allow the dog to sit on the furniture, sniff the trees at the park or even bark. One day an old woman shows up at his dental office with a toothache. Bibot pulls the tooth and is horrified when she pays him in figs. \\"These figs are special,\\" she whispers. \\"They can make your dreams come true.\\" She winks at him and puts her finger to her lips. Bibot believes she's crazy.Get ready to enter a twilight zone fantasy in Chris Van Allsburg's, \\"The Sweetest Fig\\". These perfectly-fitted illustrations come alive as you read the text of the story. A gifted storyteller as well as an artist Allsburg also supplied the illustrations.I loved the story but I had a problem with Bibot owning a dog. This man was not a dog lover. Why did he even own a dog? I can't say. But I know the dog is crucial to the story. I could see Bibot with a dog if he were forced to keep him. For example, maybe his mother goes out of town occasionally to visit relatives and only wants her beloved son to take care of Marcel. I don't think he'd say no to his mom. She's probably the only one who loves him.I just hate the fact that this man owns a dog. I'm a dog lover and yes I know this is only fiction. That's how much the story affected me.

This story is not your typical feel good, do good childrens book - it definitely has a little dark side. I would not consider this a picture book for very young children but appropiate for children in first to second grade. It lends itself well to be read aloud by an adult with some commentary and discussion with the child. It has a definite &#34; let's think about this&#34; twist to it which benefits and may even require mindful adult support and guidance. It may not be appealing to a highly impressionable child prone to bad dreams."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

The drawings are so detailed it brings out the emotions of the characters. The ending is a great surprise that you won't forget.We think the book is great and highly recommend it for kids of any age. This book is da bomb!"},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"He wowed us with the tale of a board game that sprouted animals from the deepest darkest jungles. He made us believe in magic with a train that took a lucky few children to the far reaches of the North Pole to get a glimpse of Santa Claus.Now he rightfully instills fear for the consequences of ultimate egocentrism.Chris Van Allsburg, a Caldecott Medal winner for \\"Jumanji\\" and \\"The Polar Express\\", turns toward the dark side of irony in \\"The Sweetest Fig\\", a story that serves to warn children of the possible costs of unmitigated selfishness. It also makes some keen observations on the master-slave relationship and what would happen should the tables suddenly be turned.We are first introduced to Monsieur Bibot (the story's antagonist), as a \\"fussy man\\", a dentist with an overtly meticulous nature. A place for everything and everything in its place, he even insists upon restricting his small dog Marcel from jumping up on any furniture or curiously sniffing things, torture for an energetic dog who just wants to run and play.Bibot gets an unexpected disruption in his tightly scheduled regime from an older woman in pain from a toothache. Ready to turn her away due to her lack of an appointment, she beseeches him with her agonized moans and he relents. Peering inside her mouth, he decisively pulls out a troublesome tooth and in her gratitude, the woman offers Bibot two ripe figs as payment. He scoffs at her lack of funds as well as her insistence that the figs are special - once eaten, a person's wildest dreams will truly come to fruition. It is at this point that the heartless Bibot swiftly escorts her out the door, denying her any pain medication but keeping the seemingly ordinary figs.At dinner that evening, Bibot chances to try one of the figs, marveling at its heavenly flavor. He soon finds as he wakes the next morning to a series of strange events that the figs are indeed extraordinary and vows to use the second fig to his advantage. What he doesn't count on is Marcel's confiscation of the fig and ultimately the ruination of his grand plan; he gets the shock of his life the next morning when he wakes to a world where he is no longer the \\"master\\" of his own destiny.Van Allsburg's illustrations are beautiful and life-like while still retaining a dreamy quality, its rich, warm palette consisting of chocolate, maroon, plum, taupe and tan a pleasure to gaze upon. Bibot's long, pointy nose skirted by an Imperial-style moustache, narrow face with wire-rimmed spectacles and fastidiously knotted bowtie give him that snobbish, aristocratic air of which Van Allsburg writes. When looking at pictures of Bibot with a brow deeply furrowed in disdain for the gift of the figs or wielding a rolled-up newspaper ready to strike his poor dog for innocently lounging in a chair, a reader can hardly wait for him to get his comeuppance and Van Allsburg most certainly follows through, Bibot suffering a fate worse than the loss of untold riches.Bottom line: One of the most unusual stories in Van Allsburg's vast collection of children's books, \\"The Sweetest Fig\\" is a departure from the happy endings with which we are so familiar. If you dare to venture to the darker side of human nature with your child, this is a most interesting and modern tale to add to your collection."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"I'm mostly responding to the negative review--that the book is not for young children. I LOVED! reading this book with a French accent to my kids and now my grandkids. And they seemed to like it too. The story is not all sweetness and light. But most little kids i've met are figuring out life isn't either. Isn't there something cathartic about seeing disturbing, bad people do what they do, then getting their just desserts?"},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"We both thought this book was great. The pictures are fantastic and the plot not only funny but has a great twist at the end. What would you do with a magic fig? What would your pet do with one? Recommended for ages 4-8 years."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"Chris Van Allsburg's book, THE SWEETEST FIG, is an exquisitely illustrated book that raises the fascinating question, \\"What if... when you slept, your dreams came true?\\"This story tells the tale of a mean-spirited dentist, Monsieur Bibot, who lives in Paris, France, with only his small, white dog for a companion. When Bibot receives as payment two small figs from an old woman who can't afford to pay him for his dental services, he is furious. The woman tells Bibot that these figs are special... \\"they can make your dreams come true.\\" Dreams are clearly something that Bibot cares little for... that is, until he discovers that the old woman was telling him the truth. When he finds himself standing outside a restaurant dressed only in his underwear, and the Eiffel Tower bending down as if it were made of rubber -- he rushes home and begins practicing the art of controlling his dreams. Bibot's attempt to overly-control his life takes a surprising turn, and this story vividly illustrates the point that greed and self-absorption can ruin a man's life.Because the artwork in this book is so exceptionally good and the moral of the story is so delightful, this is one book that parents will love to read to their children again and again!"},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"The sweetest fig is a great book.

The wonderful pictures make the story all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"Another great book by Chris Van Allsburg. I do an author study with my second graders and they particuarly love this book. They love to hear it read with a bit of a French accent. The children have great empathy for poor Marcel and really appreciate when he triumphs over the self-absorbed Bibot. This book is in much demand in my classroom after it has been introduced as a read aloud. Highly recommended. It is an often overlooked Van Allsburg book but it is actually my favorite. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"THE SWEETEST FIG combines rather ordinary settings with magic and mystery similarly to what Van Allsburg does in his picture book classics JUMANJI, THE STRANGER, and THE POLAR EXPRESS. The setting of THE SWEETEST FIG is Paris and our main character is a nasty dentist named Bibot living with his long suffering dog Marcel. Through magical means Bibot gets his comeuppance and Marcel the upper hand by the end of the story. Like many picture books (including many of Van Allsburg's) the illustrations, theme and language are really too sophisticated for the Preschool/Kindergarten picture book crowd and can be much better appreciated by children in elementary/middle school. Bibot does appear in his underwear in one scene and there is some implied violence in some of the illustrations but nothing else to make this clever story objectionable to the average reader."},{"Title":"The Sweetest Fig","review":"The Sweetest Fig, by Chris Van Allsburg is one of those unique books that is simply \\"different.\\" I can think of no other way of describing this book, other than delightfully and simply \\"quirky.\\" It is an absolute delight for both young and old. It is a simple story of an uptight dentist, a long suffering dog, an old, poor lady down on her luck, and two very interesting, magic figs which will make your dreams come true. The dentist takes the two magic figs, rather begrudgingly, as payment for dental work done for the old lady.Now this is enough of the story line. This is a story of greed and the consequences of greed. The art work in this small book is absolutely wonderful. The longer you study each frame, the better it gets. The text is quite simple and very easy to understand. The story explores a side of human nature (for some people) that needs to be explored. Your kids will be running into individual like our unlikeable dentist all of their lives, and this book will give them something to remember and something to snicker about as they get older. Now some folk, I like to call them the \\"hand-wringers\\" will think that the story, and the way it is told, may not be appropriate for younger children. Yes, there is some implied mild violence, some very sly and vague Freudian imagery (if your child can spot this, then she or he is well beyond the understanding level of most adults and you probably need to upgrade the child's reading list.) and indeed, the way the greedy dentist treats his dog is not nice at all. This of course is the responsibility of each individual parent to make this decision, but for the life of me, I cannot find the objection here.This wonderful morality tale gives the parent loads of little items that can be discussed with the child as the story is being read, and there are many little lessons to be learned here. I have read this book to children in the class room as young as six and they all certainly got the meaning of the story, enjoyed it, and loved it when the dentist got what was coming to him. Let us not underestimate the brightness of our children. In many ways they are much smarter and more perceptive than we are. Recommend this one highly.

The Sweetest Fig is the story of French Dentist named Bibot who is given two seemingly ordinary figs as payment for dental services rendered. The old woman who gives Bibot the figs tells him that the figs can \\"make your dreams come true.\\" As the story progresses, it keeps the audiences attention easily. Most of the classes I have read this to (3rd & 4th Grade) seem to think the results of Bibot's first dream are hilarious and are eager to hear the outcome. The ending is rather abrupt but satisfying where Bibot gets his just rewards. Overall, Van Allsburg does a magnificent job (as always) both authoring and illustrating this intriguing tale.

I decided to share them with my kindergartener, hoping that she would not only delight in the illustrations but also be able to understand the message underlying the stories. Some of Van Allsburg's stories have hidden layers that younger children may be oblivious to, but older children and adults will appreciate.In \\"The Sweetest Fig\\", readers are introduced to Bibot the dentist, a selfish and cruel man who thinks only of himself. His long-suffering dog, Marcel is not even allowed to bark, except on Bastille Day! One day, a poor old woman comes to Bibot's practice and begs him to remove her tooth. However instead of the cash he expects, Bibot is presented with the gift of two figs which the old lady promises are especially unique. Bibot fumes and chases the old lady out of his office, but does eat one of the figs later that evening. The next day, Bibot finds that his dreams of the night before have manifested in reality! It is then that Bibot truly understand the significance of the figs, and left with only one, he schemes to achieve material wealth. Will Bibot attain his dreams? The climax is truly a delight to read and the illustrations enhance the reader's pleasure.My daughter was able to understand what the story was about, and the idea of the magical figs delighted her. She was very upset at Bibot's treatment of Marcel the dog, and Bibot truly is a most despicable character.

It's all run together and very poorly made. The little \\"take a look inside the book\\" link is completely deceptive. The \\"look\\" shows the illustrations and something akin to the original fonts.

This is a different paradigm than \\"fighting the disease\\" or symptom-treating with natural remedies in lieu of pharmaceutical drugs.I haven't talked to her in years, but Dr. Newman was on the cutting edge of healing and pet nutrition back when I consulted with her in the '90's. After reading this book, it's obvious she remains so, today. I believe you owe it to your pet to read this book. It will open your mind and it will empower you.

When I read the introduction, I realized that this was a book written almost half a century ago and reissued recently. I learned that Hal Borland had died in the 1970s, but had been a prolific writer about many things and especially outdoor life. His story about the dog who chose to stay with him and his wife began on Christmas night and continues over the ensuing years. His descriptions of the dog, Pat, his rural life as a writer, sportsman, and gardener are completely absorbing. They draw you into the world of the upper Connecticut valley by the Housatonic River. I soon began to wonder about his wife, Barbara, and found that her obituary had just been published in the NY Times on the day I looked for reference to her in Google. I felt a real sense of loss at that. This is how Hal Borland's wonderful descriptive writing lead me to feel as though I was back in time and there with them over 50 years ago. Most of all, Pat, his dog, comes alive as a unique yet thoroughly doglike personality who charms and delights the reader. Pat is just one more example of why humans love dogs so much."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Came to Stay","review":"I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to this book as it was one of my first \\"adult\\" books, given to me by my grandmother when I was 9.

I don't like his novels so well, except for \\"When the Legends Die\\" one of his later books, but his non-fiction is excellent -- factual, loving, but not much anthropomorphism. The dog has his own dignity and the author does his best to convey this. If you are looking for a truthful and loving recounting of the relationship between an older man and a dog, as opposed to the usual sentimental 'boy and his dog' bit, this is a book worth finding."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Came to Stay","review":"well written this book is so real that I can my self relate to it with my love for dogs and how aware they are of people . and also the relation of the husband and wife."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Came to Stay","review":"Still reading this story and truly love it. Look forward to reaching for it each night (and day when I can). If you are an animal lover and have had any pets before you should be moved by this story as it gives you a view from all sides, both human and animal. Still love reading it and will be dissapointed when I reach the end."},{"Title":"The Dog Who Came to Stay","review":"It was interesting to read a book about a pet from the male perspective--very enlightening, educational, and interesting. I liked this book in general but loved the escapades that Pat had, how they ended up, and their effect on everyone. I enjoyed learning about the other animals and their habits. I loved that Hal knew exactly what his dog wanted, his routines and likes and dislikes. I love how he realized his moods, thoughts, reasons why he did what he did and his total understanding of this dog. Having a dog, I totally understand how they &#34;talk&#34; to us! I could envision the fields, ponds, countryside and area that they wandered and spent their time--it was quite relaxing to read.

But they don't need to be! I used the guide to Andalusia to plan my 5-city itinerary, including a stop in Ronda which I'd never heard of but ended up being one of the highlights of our travels. This guide gives you a general view of the sights to see, with many photos and maps. But especially in a country like Spain, the wise traveler makes his or her first stop the tourist office--there's one in every city and many towns. That's where you get your map, the info on walking tours, a schedule of museum openings and closings, etc.I can't resist giving two tips: the tourist office in Seville near Plaza Nueva has FREE internet. And be sure to go to the Alcazar--I thought it outshone the more famous Alhambra, with far less hassle and far fewer people.I agree with the reviewer who says the hotel info is not good, and the author of this guide could probably eliminate it with no loss except excess weight. These days the internet is by far your best source. And as for restaurants, just wander!I loved this guide, but no one source is going to have it all for the independent traveler--and in any guide, info on hotels and restaurants is usually out-of-date before it's printed. But use this guide to dream--it's great"},{"Title":"Seville & Andalusia (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"As is true of DK's Eyewitness books, this book is full of fantastic pictures. It's great to wet one's appetite, but doesn't really have enough meaty information to help one prepare to visit Andalusia. It's one saving grace: great maps. I recommend this book, but not alone. This is a great companion to The Rough Guide to Andalucia."},{"Title":"Seville & Andalusia (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"As always, Eyewitness has the best maps. The coverage of Seville makes it the best guide for that city, period. The coverage of the outlying major areas, such as Granada and Cordoba, should be supplemented with the Cadogan book on Seville, Granada, Cordoba, but the Eyewitness has the best information on eating, shopping, getting around, hotels, and culture survival for Seville. If you are staying in Seville, take this book with you into the streets when you go."},{"Title":"Seville & Andalusia (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"I read 2 generic \\"Spain\\" travel books and one additional book on Andalusia prior to our recent trip (I was the nominated \\"planner.\\") We decided to take the Eyewitness Travel Guide because it was focused and had very good information. This book has more information on Seville than other areas of Andalusia, but even the other areas were adequately covered. We used the book primarily for Seville, but also for Granada and Cordoba. The maps and illustrations were especially helpful. As we booked hotels prior to departing, we can offer no comments about the hotels section. Similarly, not been classical \\"foodies\\" we liked to wander and look for a place when we got tired and hungry. These eating/sleeping strategies worked well for us, so the maps, info, pics and history made this book great for our purposes: deciding what we wanted to see, knowing it when we got there, history etc. One minor issue, the way opening dates/times are arranged was confusing to me. In one instance a closing time was listed incorrectly, but I'll take the blame for not checking it out beforehand. The generic sections (types of food, transportation etc.) on travel in Spain were also helpful, although one of the other travel guides (Rick Steves) did a much better job. All-in-all, with the benefit of knowledge from other books, it was a good choice to take this one along."},{"Title":"Seville & Andalusia (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"I love these books.

I love the pictures and cross sections as well as the brief and concise snippets on many interesting towns, sights etc. It gives a very strong visual and overview of many places so you can decide where you may actually want to visit.

I love Eyewitness Travel Guides."},{"Title":"Hearing God's Words: Exploring Biblical Spirituality (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"As I began to read Hearing God's Words, I had high expectations. I got this book because I felt it is always important for me as a reminder not to approach the Holy Word of God academically as I do find myself doing sometimes. There is a need to read it devotionally. As much as what D.A. Carson said during his conference in Kuala Lumpur a couple of months ago that we can and should combine both the devotional reading and studying of Scriptures - do devotion in Greek for example and in my case, do devotion through my assignments - it is still a good reminder.Halfway through the book however, I felt a bit lost: either I lost him or he lost me. I understand that the word \\"spirituality\\" is notoriously difficult to define. Peter Adam did not define or explain it and as such, when I was midway through, I did not know what he was getting at.He started by stressing the importance of biblical spirituality without quite explaining what it is exactly. That was followed by what I refer to as short introductions of various books in the Old and New Testament. I kept saying, I know but so what? When I reached the chapter where he summarises Calvin's theology of revelation, I had to start again from the beginning, because he totally lost me. It was not until the third quarter of the book, when he discussed the issues in spirituality that I began to have an idea where he is going. With that, I had to again restarted right from the beginning!Adam segregated the Christian belief into 3 schools of thought (p.40-41):(1) The Reformed and Evangelical View- all God's saving words and works are found within the Bible- spirituality of the Word will focus entirely on the Bible for the content of the knowledge of God- the witness of the Spirit within the believer and the Church will correspond with his external witness in Scripture (I don't quite understand this statement, by the way)(2) The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and some charismatics view- in addition to the Bible, God has continued to do his saving works and words over the last 2000 years- he has revealed new truths and supported them with new miracles- spirituality of the Word will not only include the words of the Bible but also words given to the Church since Bible times, whether recognised by the Pope, Patriach, or Council of the Church, or given by a prophet in a local church(3) The Quaker and Liberal View- revelation comes direct from God today by observation, reason, experience or emotion- it may include some ideas from the Bible, tradition of the Church but will find other parts obsolete and irrelevant- a spirituality of discerning what God is saying at the present time, in the world around or within our own conscience- a spirituality of the contemporary words of GodHolding the first view, Adam writes to show how the Bible is a rich and fruitful resource for spirituality. He writes to show the fundamental shape and structure of the \\"spirituality of the Word\\" and the spirituality that the Bible teaches and encourages and what it results from using the Bible. He does it through highlighting the importance of the imparting of the Word through the Old and New Testament, what John Calvin said about revelation, through some issues and examples in spirituality.Holding the first view myself, I kept having this feeling that he is merely stating the obvious. As such, I am not sure how it would follow through with those holding the second or third view."},{"Title":"Hearing God's Words: Exploring Biblical Spirituality (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"What could I share with my church? God has spoken; he speaks now, and has a great deal to say to us continually. The limitations of Pentecostalism reduce the means by which God speaks. For instance, a church service where the preacher and believer are vessels through which God speaks, the first by sermon preparation and delivery and the second by the gifts of the Holy Spirit in whoever \`feels' they should speak for God. If this is true, then God cannot possibly be speaking to the world. This is a huge contradiction of the Gospel. (John 3:16-17) \\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.\\" How can the world know what God has said, is saying, and wants to say if a church service is the only context through which God speaks?Spirituality is the context through which God speaks and includes creation, community and Holy Communion (and even a dumb ass to Balaam). But spirituality has to find its moorings in the Bible or it can be subjective to the miniature narrative of our own existence instead of Creator Father God. Therefore, the Bible tells us to marvel at his handiwork and consider it. Surely God is speaking to us as we do this? Surely God speaks to us through our responsibilities and duties? For me, it would be as a husband, father, pastor, neighbor and fellow human being both privately and publically. But this eclectic variety has to be anchored in the Bible so it becomes a definitive biblical spirituality where God is Father who speaks to the world and to me. We must not spoil this by substituting the bible, adding to it or exaggerating it. We must approach it in its fullness without attempting to get away with the bare minimum. Neither must we take the fullness of the Bible and use it as an argument against error or false teaching.Throughout the Bible God \`speaks.' In Genesis it was words of power and promise. In Deuteronomy it was words of proclamation. In Psalms it was living hope. In Proverbs true wisdom. In Job it was words characterized in revelation and finally, in Jeremiah God's words are put in the mouth. Therefore, in the Old Testament the Bible shows the variety of ways in which God singularly \`speaks.' The same can be said throughout the New Testament. God was not silent but spoke through his Son Jesus in the Gospel accounts. In Romans God speaks like the book of Deuteronomy in proclamation. Colossians shows that God's words dwell in us (mainly through community participation in God's words); Hebrews becomes a reminder of what God has already said, while Peter and John write about God speaking living and enduring words. Finally, the Holy Spirit is speaking what he hears around the throne of God directly to his church. This is not just heard on a Sunday, but again, through creation, community and Holy Communion. I would also add that certain times, seasons, objects, actions and places can be the sacred means by which God speaks. A birthday celebration can be a sacred moment parallel to an individual baby dedication or adult baptism. God is still speaking. Again, this has to be moored in the Bible. If this does not happen then we become subject to many voices that compete for our time and attention - namely Satan and his words to Eve.I would summarize this to a friend by taking the \`weird' and \`crazy' out of God speaking to us. We do not need to stand in a cemetery in the early hours of the morning waiting for \`something' to speak to us! The Bible does not take us out of the world we live in and into artificial seminary to learn about God. The Bible encourages the journey through life on earth. (Matthew 6:10) \\"...your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\\" I would tell my friend that he can know God personally in the context of the world that He loves. He will not know God directly, as not even the heavens and earth He created can contain him so how much less will our minds comprehend him. But this paradox is not a contradiction of the Bible. It reveals that the incomprehensible God and Father can be known through His Son Jesus.I would also tell my friend that God does not speak to him in the tone of Charlton Hesston, also taking the weird and crazy out of it. I would add that God speaks to him through others, through him in his day-to-day living, in him within his conscience - but also like him. So, God speaks to be like a forty-one year old English man living in the United States. Why would he speak like my father, mother, wife, children, friends or enemies? He can speak through all of these but not like them. I would not be listening. The fact remains that my friend listens to himself more than anything or anyone else. This has biblical moorings and is therefore biblical spirituality.The fact that God has spoken, speaks now, and wants to say a lot more builds a rich God-human relationship and transforms human relationships. Through any means (creation, community or Holy Communion) the words of God shape our experience. He commands that we \`love our enemies' which is utterly transforming. He also commands that we \`forgive' even as we have been forgiven. We did not actually do anything to be forgiven. Grace was not given to us because we repented. Grace was extended that we may repent. God's words to us are that we forgive \`others' before they say or do anything. Because this is powerfully transforming in human relationships it must proceed from a God-human relationship.It also means that God can be speaking to me through community that is entirely \`human.' Of that community, some are family, friends and colleagues. Others are enemies or not known to me. In either case, God can speak through them to me. Again, this can transform human relationships but must be balanced within the Bible, otherwise, those who God speaks through can become \`special people' which God never intended. Thank God Balaam did not turn his ass into an icon to worship - ass worshipping people?"},{"Title":"The Names Upon The Harp: Irish Myths And Legends","review":"This book is Irish legend at its detailed, grizzly best; lots of tribal-type violence, featuring huge warriors who fight bloody battles (with or without their heads on...), disfunctional families(including grandfathers attempting to murder grandsons and children changed into swans by evil stepmothers). These very Irish stories are probably meant for those over age 8 or 9 years. These are the &quot;campfire&quot; stories that keep superstition alive, and wee Irish children behaving themselves."},{"Title":"The Names Upon The Harp: Irish Myths And Legends","review":"This book is filled with amazingly beautiful illustrations and well written stories about some of Ireland's most famous heros and heroines. It is divided into three parts highlighting three major sections of Ireland's mythology and each part has a forward giving you some background information about the stories contained in it. One of my favorite parts are the tales about Cuchullainn, the Hound of Ulster. Another great thing about the book is the pronunciation guide at the back to help you pronounce the strange names of Ireland's ancestors. It also includes a list of other books you can find for other stories about Irish Legends. Although parts of the book are somewhat bloody I find them necissary for the history and not at all overdone. This is a well-rounded book: good writing, wonderful presentation, and amazing illustrations. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Names Upon The Harp: Irish Myths And Legends","review":"\\"The Names Upon the Harp\\" is a collection of Irish legends from the three main cycles set down by scholars to classify the ancient manuscripts that record the tales: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle and the Fenian Cycle. As retold by Marie Heaney, she begins each part with an introduction to that particular cycle and then launches into her favourite stories from that area.The Mythological Cycle concerns the Tuatha Da Danaan, who were some of the early occupants of Ireland who defeated the Fomorians and were later in turn defeated by the Milesians who drove them underground. Heaney thus includes the stories that best describe these two events: \\"Moytura\\" that recounts how the Fomorian Balor of the Evil Eye was killed by his grandson Lugh, and \\"The Children of Lir\\", who were changed into swans by their stepmother and forced to live on until the peal of a bell rang in the new faith.The Ulster Cycle concerns the doings of King Conor Mac Nessa and his court at their home of Emain Macha, including \\"The Birth of Cuchulainn\\", the strongest warrior of all, \\"Bricriu's Feast\\", who attempted to cause competition and strife between the warriors, and \\"Deirdre of the Sorrows\\" who was the Irish version of Blodewynn, Gwynevere and Helen: a beautiful woman caught between the love of two men who eventually causes their downfall.Lastly, the Finn Cycle is of the Fianna Warriors and the bloodline of their leader Finn Mac Cumhaill: \\"Finn and the Salmon of Knowledge\\" tells of his upbringing and the gaining of his wisdom, \\"The Enchanted Deer\\" tells of his love affair with Sadb, a beautiful woman cursed in the form of a deer, and \\"Oisin in the Land of Youth\\", the story of Finn's son who travels to Ti Na N-Og with his beloved, only to return back to Ireland to find many thousands of years have past. The Finn Cycle also includes a poem \\"Summer\\", translated from the Irish by Seamus Heaney.Therefore, the book covers a wide range of the mythology canon of Ireland, but one wishes that there had been more to fill in the blanks between each myth - often fascinating characters and plot points are introduced only to fall by the wayside, and often drastically important stories are left out entirely: Cuchulainn's death for example. Likewise, although Heaney tells the stories adequately, there is no sense of age or importance in her narrative. The people and events are told straightforwardly, but there is no mystery, no poetry, no sense of the *timelessness* of these great stories. One senses that she wrote for the benefit of introducing children to the myths, but it becomes clear early on that these stories are definitely *not* suitable for young children.P. J. Lynch uses watercolours to capture the images of the stories, and here is where the true strength of the book lies. I have always been a huge fan of this artist, and \\"The Names Upon the Harp\\" might just be his best work. The landscapes of Ireland are just what they should be: mysterious and dark, cold and misty, rock-strewn and lake-covered. But the people: Lynch manages to catch all of them - whether strong or weak, cunning or tragic, warriors or poets, each one is realised fully. A few crowning achievements are the bitter sadness of Deirdre as she looks out upon the snow, and the pain on Oisin's face as he embraces his father farewell. As seen in other books, Lynch also enjoys creating giants: here the headless Cu Roi and the monstrous Balor are so vivid that it might be a good idea to censor this book from the little ones. This seems like a good place to say that he isn't stingy about the use of blood and violence either.All in all, this is a rewarding book that for good measure includes a pronunciation guide and a list of sources. If you like Irish myth, then there are no real complaints here, and if you are a fan of P. J. Lynch, or want to see some of his best work (if you like Alan Lee or John Howe, you'll definitely like P. J.) then look no further. \\"The Names Upon the Harp\\" is well worth the search, and definitely worth owning."},{"Title":"The Names Upon The Harp: Irish Myths And Legends","review":"I have read bought this book before for some ffriends and they liked it so I bought it again for another Irish friend who likes Irish history and such....It arrived in great shape..no shipping problems and came quickly..."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"funny as heck book.

After the first chapter I had to readjust my expectations.Ms. Halliday's self-deprecating humor and twenty-something judgments of those she travels with and encounters are what most of us are thinking (or were thinking when we were 20-something), but are afraid to say out loud. Her humor and assessment of her travel companions can be very uncomfortable at times, but what I enjoyed most was her adventurous naive spirit. She did what I wish at 20-something I had had the nerve to do. I lived vicariously through her adventures and misadventures as if I had traveled with her.I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but not for the reasons I had thought I would. It rekindled my adventurous spirit and made me sad for the adventure I gave up in the name of conformity and parental peace-making.I have read the other reviews on this book after reading the book. Many reviewers were of the opinion that Halliday was self-centered and a spoiled rich girl bohemian traveler, I could not disagree more.

I scurried away, avoiding the concerned looks and bought the book. Oh joy, oh wonder, finally, a travel book on par with my all time favorite Bill Bryson. This is a wonderful book, a joyous, searingly funny look at the road less travelled. Ms. Halliday is a master wordsmith, who translates her joy and wonder to the page in a way that makes you feel it, and long to be there with her, having adventures and experiencing all the wide world has to offer.

The situations Halliday gets into on her very-low-budget travels are mostly of the distressing variety: illness, theft, and missed cultural opportunities fill the chapters. Halliday has a wonderful gift, however, for pointing out the humor in all of these situations. She also describes unusual experiences which most travel books would never cover, and that is exactly what makes this book different from most travel books: you won't learn about all the museums and palaces in each country she has visited. Instead, you'll learn why you might *not* want to buy cigarettes from an 8-year-old on the streets of Vietnam, why there is no such thing as a free backrub, and why you should bolt your doors when staying in Pushkar, India.

Maybe it also has a lot to do with the fact that a lot of these trips were made on a very low budget, requiring her to improvise in stange places & strange situations.This book isn't for the faint hearted or the ultra conservative - Ms. Halliday speaks freely about drug use or bodily functions some people don't like hearing about in such frankness. But if you're willing to appreciate a good travel story combined with a good joke - this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"This book is filled with stories that invariably involve some combination of impromptu excursion, loose stool, and incipient crotch rot. It lurches between drunken fratboy whoohoo tedium and J.R. Peterman copywriting style self-promotion of the ain't I cool variety and contains no substantive \\"travel lessons,\\" unless one considers 'man was I stoned off my ass' type revelations insightful. In fact, considering her banzai buckaroo approach to risk assessment I wonder why Ayun hasn't been the victim of more serious misadventure than she describes. I hope that any woman traveling alone would take more precautions, as while adventure can be had the world is not solely populated with quaint country folk willing to do you a good turn. This is not to say that Ayun isn't a proficient writer, I suspect though, as evidenced by the experiences of her petulant traveling companions, that these are fairly tame episodes written about in an interesting manner. Given her knack for storytelling and interesting metaphor, the lack of any real insight in her work is all the more disappointing. BTW third world poverty isn't funny and haggling over a dollar with somebody who is really poor rather than just strapped for cash is extremely tacky and cruel but then to turn around and make a buck from the experience is just downright despicable but don't worry about that Ayun cause you rock."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"It would seem that other reviewers somehow missed the purposefully bad grammar in the title and the photo of the howling monkey on the cover and expected \\"Voltaire on Travel\\". Sure, Ms. Halliday is self-absorbed and purposefully too cool, but her point of view is mostly very funny and often hilarious. Even her naysayers would have to agree that she has a compact and breezy writing style and is a pleasure to read. Yes, monkeys, booze and hookers figure prominently in many of her stories, but heck, stories about kitty-cats, milk shakes and Parish Preists may not be as funny and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I have a fondness for travelogues and enjoy the various essays of quite a number of authors, this book... not so much. \\"No Touch Monkey\\" by Ayun Halliday is a fruitless uninspiring book of boredom. Keep in mind, these are my opinions put forth in the review. The book on a whole was lackluster. It would have been nice if at the beginning of each chapter if Ayun would make a brief subtitle entry on just where she was and when she was there. This book is less about travel and more about where in the world Ayun could get stoned, mope about here boyfriend, and generally whine about her situations. She offers far too little on looking at a foreign culture and societies but rather dwells on her miserable existence at such locations. If she plans on backpacking around the world on a miniscule budget, then she should expect it to be less than Eden-istic. Evidently she also has some attraction to the words 'pancake' and 'guerilla' as she slips them into nearly every chapter along with her constant self-degredation, not forgetting to mention a small obsession with intestinal and bowel problems.I had read other reviews on this book and felt it worthy enough to purchase, I urge others to look more closely at the less complimentary reviews before making your choice on purchasing this book. It's easily the laziest and most uninspiring travelogue I've read. You have been warned, read at your own risk of boredom and monotony."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"At first I did not really like this book, but as i read on I warmed to it.

Not a life-changer by any means, but entertaining & funny!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Ayun holds nothing back here. There is no doubt that this woman knows how to have fun. I laughed out loud many, many times. I highly suggest picking it up to anyone who likes travel and knows how to laugh."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Maybe it's because I have hardly been anywhere so any information is information to me, but I loved this book (I don't think I'd WANT to go to a few of the places, anyway!). I think several of the people who've been disappointed by this book were for some reason expecting a travel guide. Once you get the cadence of her writing (she's definately got her own way of saying things) she's hilarious and I pretty much love anyone who can make me laugh out loud. As for the reviewer a few down from mine who said the author was self-important and a know-it-all (something like that... I didn't bother to memorize it), I thought she was VERY unglamourous in her descriptions (esp. of herself!) and I loved that she admitted when she was trying to be cool or act like she knew more than she did. I have a strong feeling if I ever talked politics, religion, etc. with the author I wouldn't have a single thing in common with her, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book because I love people who can laugh at themselves. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that she lost me a little at the end with the acting stuff in Scotland."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Uninteresting personal soap opera on the road. Neurotic, easy city girl goes travelling. Yawn. The worse is her writing style. She has none. It's throw up on a page. No substance at all. You want to read some REAL travel adventures. Pick up Paul Bowles - a true writer. Save this book for the fire place."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"This book is not funny. It's the ramblings of a whiny, self-absorbed, ambitionless person, who thinks the grass (legal or otherwise) is always greener on the other side. Getting smacked around by someone in a red-light district is funny?! Descriptions of how blitzed-out one can get is interesting?! Carrying illegal drugs in foreign countries is, what, something we should all experience?! Motherhood didn't even open Ms. Halliday's eyes to responsibility - she thinks she should be able to take her baby into pubs and whines that taking care of her own child takes her away from doing what she really wants to do! Most disappointing is the fact that Stephen Colbert has a blurb on the cover. Stephen, admit it, you didn't actually read the book. I want my money back!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I believe this book has warmed the cold trail back to my long lost sister. She was never that tidy, or smart. Now she has proven my past observations to be absolutely true. I think she is why Ol' Dipper has never married after the tapioca incident with her 'girlfriends' when I was a sweet, tubby lad of nine. Girls can be really, really mean, and smelly. I last saw her in 1984 in the rear view mirror of my old Yugo as I drove away from a New Jersey Turnpike rest stop as she scurried towards the bathroom after insisting on chugging a whole bottle of ExLax for 'relief' after eating a whole pound of Quarter-Pounders in a Mickey Ds in Delaware. The adventures written in this book appear to pick up shortly after then and remain largely similar. Brings back muddy memories."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"After I finish a book, I usually ponder it for a day or two before I write its review. However, with No Touch Monkey by Ayun Halliday, my review was already written before I finished the first chapter. And it contained one repeatable word: outrageous.I'll be honest. This was my second attempt at reading this book. My first time was last year, and not being able to get into it after the first couple of pages, I gave up and tossed it aside. Yet, last week I picked it back up, agreeing to give it another try; I mean look at the cover! It called to me! I then realized that the problem the first time was not with the book at all. The problem had been with me.I am a seasoned travelogue reader, but no other travel memoir has been able to captivate me, splitting my sides in the process, much like No Touch Monkey has. Ayun (wish I knew how it was pronounced!) Halliday writes with such vibrant personality, it is hard not to wish she was your best friend. Her witty anecdotes, good-natured blunt descriptions, and her seriously funny - often surprisingly random - experiences ranging from Bali to Amsterdam, makes this book unlike any other.With all that said, I am disappointingly surprised to see so many bad reviews of this book on Goodreads - a site I trust a lot. True, this book does not contain as much information or history about the places she visits as much as it includes her travel antics, but that is one of the reasons why I feel in love with her stories. Halliday makes you want to jump off the couch and create your own wild experiences abroad, which is a huge aspect I look for in reading travelogues.Simply put, No Touch Monkey is definitely outrageous: outrageously hilarious, outrageously entertaining, and you would be an outrageous fool not to read it.Check out my other book reviews at: [...]"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"While I love to travel and enjoy getting away from the usual tourist spots to experience something more authentic about the places I visit, I must confess that I enjoy my creature comforts far too much to have any desire to experience the type of travel described in this book. The stories here are about traveling on a truly low budget, in ways that the vast majority of travellers would probably find objectionable for any number of levels. Yet the author clearly revels in her experiences, finding excitement and happiness in the adventure that almost inherently follows from the nature of her travel style.The low budget nature of Ms. Halliday's travels also means that she visits many place that I would probably never consider visiting, because of concerns about safety, or the sheer lack of modern facilities that I simply would find unacceptable. All of which means that this book has a value, in that it provides me a glimpse into these places, a chance to vicariously visit places that I probably will never see in person. So, while I may not embrace her style of travel, I'm glad that she both enjoys it and writes about her experiences."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I'm doing you a favor here: If you read this in public, people will look at you strange while you pee your pants laughing at the awesomeness that is this book.Ayun is a young, somewhat naive traveler who travels for cultural enlightenment and discovery. She perfectly blends an open, hippie-esque outlook on the world with a tendency to find herself in awkward, hilarious situations.However, there are some people who probably should not read this book. For example:--if you are one of those deadbeats who travels only to stay in nice hotels, shop til you drop, drink martinis on the beach and don't bother to engage with the locals at all, don't read this.--if you are offended by the idea of drug use, you might not want to read this, because she does describe usage of alcohol, marijuana, etc.)--if you're uptight and don't like funny stuff (hey, some people don't) then don't bother.Otherwise, READ IT!!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I am a devotee of travel humor books including my favorite, Bill Bryson. Ayun Halliday has written a wonderful book that blends interesting characters with vivid descriptions of the lands and people she visited. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"In the world of travelogues which I love to read this book is about as lightweight as they come. Yes, there are some amusing passages, but nothing hysterical like some of the reviews would have you believe. I guess the writer has a lot fans, but I'm not one.I bought it because in my many visits to Japan one of my favorite things to do is visit the monkey parks. I thought there might be something about monkeys in Japan. No, nothing about Japan except I believe the author once changed planes in Narita. That's okay, there are some monkey hijinx in other parts of the world which are described. And a travel book doesn't have to be exclusively about monkeys for me to like it.All in all there are many better travel books out there including the Travelers' Tales books. I sort of doubt you'll see any of this author's writing in one of those."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I find it interesting reading reviews of this book, which are either of the &quot;Ayun Rocks&quot; variety, or &quot;What a ugly, self-absorbed American&quot; variety. I don't think I'd want Ayun as a traveling companion, but I did enjoy her adventures, and while there are no deep insights into the travel experience, society, bringing the world together, or other high-minded ideals, there are a lot of small, unique insights sprinkled through the book if one cares to look hard enough. It's not for the squeamish. I did not find the passages on bowel movements, lack of hygiene, scoring dope, and other moments best not recounted at the family dinner table excessive, and Halliday certainly didn't set out to write another travelogue anyway. Watch Travel Channel if that isn't your cup of tea.A wouldn't call it rip-roaring hilarious, but there are a lot of laughs, and it's written breezily enough that it's a good way to while away the afternoon. If they would let me give it 3 1/2 stars, that's what I'd give this book, so I'll round up to 4 stars."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Already a big fan of 'The Big Rumpus' and her 'East Village Inky' zine, I was more than pleased to get a signed copy of Ms. Halliday's latest work as a b-day present. I was not disappointed. After about two chapters, I could barely put this book down and looked forward to bedtime every night so I could delve into the next wacky misadventure. Maybe it's her self-depracating sense of humor, maybe it's her willingness to do the things I'll never have to guts to do, maybe it's her talent with the pen. It's probably all of those things, but I loved this book and laughed aloud often enough to alarm those around me. I loved every last bit, but especially connected to the chapters on Kosiya, Doggiepants, and, because I am a mother, what it's like to suddenly find yourself tethered to a little one. And the inclusion of the 'no touch monkey' sign at the beginning was priceless. Can't rave enough about this little gem, so please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy for yourself."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I just finished the well written book, The Best Women's Travel Writing 2005, edited by Lucy McCauley which contained some wonderful travel writing, each written by a different well chosen author. Then I was presented No Touch Monkey. It, too, was chosen by the clever title and colorful cover, which promised that I would be laughing. This book is not funny or interesting (is being really dirty, sleeping on trains when you have no money, getting drunk at the Octoberfest, etc. funny and interesting?). Worse, it gives travel writing a bad name and might stop people from picking up a marvelous book, such as The Best Women's Travel Writing 2005. A bad book in a captivating cover is not a good thing."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Serious. I literally spent the whole night reading this book. That doesn't happen often. It was absolutely hilarious. Ayun's adventures in Amsterdam and Tanzania had me rolling off the couch. My dog thought I was nuts.A bit gross at times. The slipping on vomit and the hours spent in a German WC? Ayun takes vagabonding to the extreme. Surely she could have afforded to buy a few beers at Octoberfest in Munich instead of spunging off some strangers.And sleeping on the trains instead of paying the $20.00 for hostels in Europe. That's a bit extreme. In place of a $50.00 hotel room, yeah. But a measly $20.00 hostel?I thought I was the &quot;King&quot; of low budget travel - sleeping in my car at Rest Areas throughout the U.S. to save a few bucks on my book tours.Uhh, uh. Ayun has me beat by kilometers upon kilometers.I don't agree with her preferred travel style 100%. But admire her for inspiring others to save some bucks and not always go for the most comfortable of travel routes. Sometimes it can be much more fun roughing it.One of the best travel books I've ever read hands down. Ranks right up there with Rolph Potts' &quot;Vagabonding&quot; and P.J. O'Rourke's &quot;Holidays in Hell.&quot;Eric Dondero, Author, Worldwide Multilingual Phrase Book"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"The title caught my attention, it sounded funny.I've traveled quite a bit in my life,and have had some interesting and funny experiences. I thought a book about a fellow traveler's adventures would be fun. Let's start with Stephen Colbert's endorsement on the cover: \\"I laughed hard on nearly every page of this shockingly intimate travel memoir and deeply funny book\\". Did he actually READ the book? I watch both \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"Stephen Colbert\\" and think that those guys have more humor in their boogers than Ayun Halliday could ever hope to have in her entire body.There are so many things wrong with this book, most importantly that it's incoherent. There's no particular order to her travel stories. Boyfriends and/or husbands seem interchangeable and children are apparently left behind to satisfy the author's quest for a \\"hippie\\" lifestyle.Halliday apparently believes that following a travel guide's advice is the most interesting way to travel. Nothing wrong with that, millions of tourists do so every year, but it goes entirely against her self-proclaimed \\"adventurism\\". If you follow an already beaten path, it's not called exploration, it's tourism.As much as Ayun Halliday likes to pretend that she's so very liberal and accepting of other cultures, the book ultimately reads as an \\"out of place, superior American in foreign places\\" memoir.She uses accents to try to make herself understood by locals (instead of picking up that travel book, maybe she should have purchased a simple dictionary.)She , and whatever male companion she's with, spend quite a bit of time and effort on getting high. I'm not particularly interested in reading about THAT kind of bad trip. I've managed to grow up in The Netherlands, travel all over Europe (including 2 weeks on my own to Spain at 16 ) emigrate to the USA at 19 and all that without ever getting high.Oh, even at 16 years old I knew better than to let people take advantage of me. The house boat in Kashmir ? If you weren't being treated correctly, why in the world would you pay for another week of poor food and service? And why would you pay $200 for some sightseeing? That's a lot of money in a country like India, at least do the bare minimum of research before acting ignorant in a foreign country.(And then blame YOUR gullibility on the local people who are trying to scrape by in a very tough economy.)The icing on the cake is of course the political barbs agains George Bush (voting for him is evil!!!)and anyone who isn't as \\"free spirited\\" as the author.As a side note, you have an 11 month old who's breastfeeding (okay, fine , and I didn't even take offense at the rather militant \\"I don't care who sees it\\" statement, although it obviously interfered with your precious theater schedule). But when you start talking about rows of jars of babyfood? Hmmm, I'm far from a hippy, but at 11 months all three of my children were eating regular food. I actually rarely bought babyfood jars, just about everything their father and I ate, they ate. I guess that's why I had 4 year olds eating sushi with chopsticks, long before sushi bcame \\"fashionable\\" around here.In summary yet another :\\"look, I'm better than the \\"bovine masses\\" (her words, really!)because I managed to read a mass published travel guide and showed those \\"depraved foreign\\" people how superior Americans are\\" book."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I bought No Touch Monkey based on title alone. So funny, it perfectly describes situations I've seen while traveling. That said, I found the writing to be less funny than the title. Not bad by any means, just not gut-splitting or snicker inducing. I had the same response from two of my traveling friends who'd read it. They smiled, but no laughs.Ayun Halliday's self-deprecating and sarcastic writing is likeable. But the pattern in each chapter quickly becomes apparent: she and her companions make incredibly naive and/or dangerous choices in oddball foreign places and bumble through the results. Halliday's younger self is often whiny or dislikeable, which is to the author's credit and done in a self-mocking manner, but even this becomes tiring when combined with the predictability of the essays. Sadly, the \\"No Touch Monkey\\" chapter that I'd been anticipating was a bit of a let-down. Maybe the brilliant title dooms the book. Compared, the writing lags. Which is a dead shame, because Halliday is a genuinely funny lady. Her column in Bust magazine is a spirited and slightly twisted take on motherhood and she also maintains an excellently quirky website."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I've read many, many books of travel essays-- and am always a fan of humorous ones-- but Ayun Halliday's book is my favorite, by far. \\"No Touch Monkey\\" is a riot from page one, and I had such a hard time putting it down that-- I swear this is true-- I kept reading it while I was in labor with my fourth child. (Yes, an epidural helped with that). She is so funny and at the same time so vulnerable-- never afraid to delve into her own bad hygiene, grievous errors in judgment, or embarrassing situations if it's likely to give the reader a good belly laugh. It takes courage to write that way. There is an innocence and sense of adventure to her viewpoint that makes her writing original and a pleasure to read. I look forward to much more from her-- traveling with her children, perhaps? Uh-oh!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I really expected this to be gutbustingly funny, but it's not. Given that \\"travel lessons learned too late,\\" is included in the title, it is reasonable to assume that this is just misadventures, and it certainly is that. But the fact is, rather than coming across as something humourous, I just feel like Ayun Halliday is whining incessantly. This is partly due to the fact that she seems to get herself into trouble where just an ounce of common sense would have made things better...then again, that would have inevitably made this book nonexistent.That's not saying that there is nothing interesting or funny in this book. The monkey breaking into their residence in India was pretty funny, as was their misery in Romania. But other than that, I expected a lot more out of this. It just drags on, and on, with any bit of humour being sprinkled about like tiny grains of salt."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I had some difficulty with this book, No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late, by Ayun Halliday. In it, Halliday reminisces on her earlier traveling days, when she wanted to spend no more than a few dollars a day, didn't bath for extended periods, ate from the street stalls, and used the local drugs.It was difficult to connect with Halliday as a fellow travel-spirit. She had no problem using drugs in some very dangerous areas. I was never entirely sure why she wanted to travel the absolutely cheapest way possible. Certainly she didn't leave an economic contribution behind in the poorer areas of the world visited. And then she would return to the US.There is a \\"newer\\" type of travel that seems to be expanding, called \\"poverty tourism.\\" Now, this isn't what Halliday was engaged in; she certainly wasn't a traveling voyeur to take photos of the misery of others. This was more of a \\"slumming\\" form of traveling (defined as \\"...To visit impoverished areas or squalid locales, especially out of curiosity or for amusement\\").And then she would return to the US, an ...ambassador from the west?\\"Smoking pot is a good vacation activity for me as it amplifies my natural inclination to lie on my side, eating.\\"\\"Greg and I had been in transit [in India] for forty-eight hours and my patience for the rubble, cows, stalled trucks, and the myriad other things that can block a narrow mountain pass was at an all-time low.\\"\\"I had nothing to hide [at a police check-point], but still felt nervous, much more so than I had when I crossed the border from Rwanda into Tanzania on Christmas day with that hash tucked in my sleeping bag.\\"\\"Feeling grouchy as hell, I accepted a pull from the heavy glass bottle David extended. Jesus Christ! I've never been to Utah, but I can't imagine the Great Salt Lake would taste much different. It was like licking the bottom of the popcorn bowl.\\"You get the drift.There seemed to be an overall lack of respect for different cultures. I wonder if Halliday could have survived the local rigors of becoming a Peace Corps volunteer in one of these countries.Now, with all of this said, there were pieces of this book that I really appreciated. When Halliday wasn't complaining about the food, or the medicine, or the lodging, or the neighborhood, or whatever, she actually had some interesting, insightful, and witty observations. But... \\"The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\\""},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I got this book because the cover seemed kinda funny, and I like travel/adventure books. But all it reads as is one boring chapter after another of some immature girl travelling on the cheap; her travel tips seem to come solely from Rick Steves' books.She gives no insight on the places she's been. She tells us in a sentence she went to Dachau. Instead, she spins her yarn around her boyfriend's \\"assault\\" by an attendant in a men's room and the subsequent Happy Meal to cheer him up. If you want to hear about someone's adventure abroad, wouldn't you like to know what the place was like?Ayun makes a point of bad mouthing the foolish American tourist abroad but only shows herself as one of those she scorns."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I love travel essays but these are flat. They aren't so much travel stories - stories that make you laugh but also give you enough insight as to whether or not you'd like to put the place on your must-see list - as they are a journal about an odd woman who seems to revel in how cheap she is and how dirty she can get. If she loves the places she's been or the people she's met she doesn't show it.

It was especially a bonus that most of the travels were to places I had not quite made it to. Ayun is a traveler after my own heart, with a drive to really step off the beaten path (and sometimes tumble painfully off of it) and immerse herself in the local culture; questionable food stalls, dark alleys, remote villages and all. My favorite aspect of the writing is the author's knack for a well turned phrase: you never know what you'll get after a comma! Lots of laughs, usually. The way she adds details to a description, building up the comedy and the unexpected factor, is hilarious. I'm also game for good accounts of psychedelic experiences, and there are some crazy ones here.The author sets herself apart from the typical \\"omg, did you get that at Gap?\\" American backpacker. Her analytical musings on a variety of situations highlight the unexpected. The quest of the travels seems to be to find something that is interesting and different from the regular day to day of western existence back home. Sometimes the author finds moments of bliss in a zen-like way, in the small things; the way a sparse hotel room's walls end in latticework that continues up to the ceiling, or in a gorilla's roar. It's these moments that hit the nail on the head in terms of meeting an expectation imagined when still at home, dreaming of traveling. More often though, are the moments of anti-bliss, which illustrate the flipside of the totally foreign travel experience. The author's unflappable spirit in the face of random thieves, illnesses, and scary dogs, makes this book a giggle-inducing page turner 'til the end."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I've read this book nonstop since I picked it up a couple days ago.

While I found a few of the essays entertaining, others seemed pointless (\\"On Beauty\\"--about the Paris fashion show) and one (\\"On Freedom\\"--passing your child off to the club's dancers while you get wasted? Really?) was simply tasteless. Having just finished Chuck Thompson'sSmile When You're Lying: Confessions of a Rogue Travel Writer, a no-holds-barred travel collection which had me laughing so hard in some parts, I cried--I couldn't help but feel letdown. Halliday's tales brought about a few smiles, yes, but none of the anticipated rip-roaring laughter here. And though the back of the book claims Halliday is a \\"self-admittedly bumbling tourist,\\" her tone suggests she's the kind of person who relishes the idea that she's been everywhere before it was cool and that her shoestring-budget experiences are more authentic than others'. A little too self-absorbed for my tastes."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Ayun describes her travels and the unexpected turns that they took.I found her easy going humor very earthy and relatable.Most of them are in Asia. I loved the one about the camel ride! Hilarious adventures of mishaps, and interesting happenings."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"This is a travel memoir of backpacking journeys she did years before she married her husband Greg and had two kids. That explains why the stories are superficial and mostly about her misadventures. There is very little detail about the people around her, or the terrain around her, (and nothing of historical significance) but certainly a lot about herself. If you are drunk or high reading her stories, perhaps you may get a chuckle, but otherwise the read is rather mundane because the focus is on her rather than the travel.Still, it's not a bad read. This book is a collection of her pot-smoking days traveling around Europe and Asia on her parents' money and having a great time with friends she stays with. There's nothing wrong with that kind of travel at all. It's just not very exciting to read about and not in par with better travel writers.If you enjoy traveling via Lonely Planet books, this book is for you. If you want clues on how to smuggle pot across African borders, or want to know where the cheapest doobie is in Asia, this book is for you.Perhaps talking about washing one's \\"malodorous vagina\\" in a public restroom in Germany may offend some prudish readers.My only complaint is that Ayun wrote about the Amazon reviews on her website (which is mentioned on the backcover of the book) on 16 March 2007. That explains why the last three reviews before mine were five-star reviews with little substance. That I find a bit sophomoric. Really Ayun, do you need to do that to get your book ratings up? You are a talent in your own right.

The writing is funny, I laughed out loud in public. Sure, most of the situations she gets into are of her own making; whether it be bad decisions, stoned decisions, or lazy decisions. However, when all turns out well (and funny) it's easy to forgive her that- I wasn't soured by distaste for her the way some other reviewers have been. I've also read a few reviews that were bad because people seemed to want to get deeper with the book; I don't share that complaint. To me it was a quick, funny read, perfect for lounging in front of the fan with on a hot day- exactly what I was looking for. It also scored points for reminding me of some of my own travel adventures. Anyone who travels must have some stories about things that were horrifying at the time, and hilarious in retrospect. Books like this remind me to do more to remember those things, and live them up while they're happening by thinking and acting outside the box.So that's the good stuff.But the last chapter was a total downer. She should have changed the chapter title to \\"Having a baby ruins all the fun\\", because that's essentially the message here. Maybe I'm overreacting to this message because as an avid and hungry traveler, it's one of my worst fears. It's just so out of left field in a book that until that point is largely about sleeping around and smoking dope in foreign countries. Suddenly, she's got a kid and noone except other parents want to hang out with her (and them not really because her kid sucks) She doesn't totally give up without a fight though; there's also the disturbing scene about her getting trashed while out for dinner and drinks with her friends and her baby, who has to be held by everyone else that night. that's just creepy to me. I love a good time myself, but the baby thing skeeves me out a little.So I'm going to rip out the last chapter and hand it around to my friends. I think they'll get a kick out of it."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I just love Ayun's books.

Brave enough to publish even the most grizly of details, Ayun shows how even a seasoned traveler can be felled to her proverbial knees in the face of other customs, cultures, and uh, sewer systems. Her honesty, though shocking at first, makes this a good (okay...great) read. Ayun's humor is clever, her experiences outrageous, and her personality oddly beguiling. I am tempted myself to go have some offbeat, comic, low budget traverses of my own...except I'm now off to read her other book, the big rumpus!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I'm a great fan of this sort of book but this one surprized me. Ms Halliday takes us on quite a journey throughout the world and focuses almost exclusively on her own discomforts--how poor she is, how high she is, how dirty she is, how sick she is, how unlucky she is to have male companions less game for &quot;authentic&quot; experiences than herself, then there is her bowel...I realized that I was reading a book by the proverbial ugly American. As such it is a chastening tale to us all, and worth the read."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Most of the negative reviews focus on the author's silly, naive, self-centered misadventures. But I seriously think this is the stated theme of the book. Maybe she doesn't come out and call herself \\"self-centered,\\" but I get the feeling she is aware of foolish missed opportunities here and there. She is certainly aware of mistakes born out of ignorance on her part.There are drug references, too, but not tons of them (don't go NEAR \\"Do Travel Writers Go to Hell\\" if drug stories bother you), and in almost every case she expresses some sort of regret over the experience--not guilty \\"drugs are evil\\" feelings, just the sense that she was an idiot.I read the book in two days, sitting in front of an electric fan during a heat wave. And I had a good time.It's a silly, frivolous bunch of stories, written in lightweight form. Take it or leave it."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"This book had me laughing out loud on the plane - more than once! I couldn't read it fast enough and was so sad when it was over! Granted, I'm glad I got to read it and not experience some of these events with her! She can be coarse and she can be wild but Ayun is definitely entertaining. Her humor and openness show how traveling with great expectations or 'written in stone' itineraries is the best way to miss the experience you were looking for. I'm just glad I'm not her mother!!!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I laughed out loud as I read this cautionary tale of world travel and could not put it down.

Asia / Latin America on either: a cultural pilgrimage, a voyage of self-discovery, or a means of squandering their trust-funds.When they return, many of them regale their friends with their tales of their \\"awesome time\\" in Bali or Belize or Belgium. You can almost hear the sameness in the stories: \\"Dude! We like, bought some bud and got totally wasted!\\" or \\"We were so broke, we ended up stealing food from a vendor's stall!\\"What spares many of us from being subjected to their clueless, self-obsessed ramblings is that most of them don't have book contracts. This book solves this problem by providing the reader with the equivalent of a twenty-something's \\"rilly kewl\\" globe-trotting adventures.I found this book to be unreadable. Her adventures are no more remarkable than those of any other privileged young American adult. She takes a picture of prostitutes in Amsterdam and gets accosted for it. How Edgy! What I did manage to read were a series of banal scenarios where the focus is on Ayun and her \\"wacky\\" mis-adventures. If you want to read travel essays written by someone that has a modicum of intelligence or historical perspective, stick with Pico Iyer, Bruce Chatwin, Rebecca West, etc. Unless, like, you totally want to read about some priviledged girl and her \\"incredible\\" adventures that all devolve into the type of self-aggrandizing blather one would hear in a late night college dorm-room bull session."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"i have a slight and manageable learning disability that makes reading a bit of a chore, so if a book doesn't hold my interest, i don't read it. and i read this book start to finish and enjoyed every bit of it with the exception of the author's too-evocative description of her dislocated knee (perhaps because i'm a nurse it was too easy visualize).anyway.........the style is fluid and friendly, the stories are alternately funny andevocative and it's got the ability to create the 'you were there' feeling necessary to distinguish one travel book from the hundreds of travel books written by people who shouldn't write travel books.Best praise i can offer: i'm now going to search out her other books"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I was very disappointed!

I suffered through 226 pages of it before finally giving up.This is not a book about a young woman going interesting places and learning new things which she shares with the reader. This is a book about a spoiled suburban Indianapolis brat who gets to go to many of the world's most wonderful places, but completely fails to appreciate them because she's either too stoned, too homesick (for either suburban Indianapolis or suburban Chicago, though she pretends to be from the city), or too wrapped up in her own judgmental view of the world to be open to the experiences around her.I've been to many of the same places that the author has and this could have been a wonderfully quirky, interesting, and informative book. But it's not. It's barely a travelogue, and comes off mostly as a 16-year-old girl's delusional diary.Make that a foul-mouthed 16-year-old. The book pretty much starts off with the girl quizzing her mother about oral sex and goes downhill from there. How many times do I need to read the F-word in a book? Not even as quotes, but as descriptions in the text. She describes one of the world's greatest, most legendary and exotic hotels as \\"F---ed in the head\\" for adhering to the social norms of the city in which it is located. That's classy. And pretty much gives you an idea of the tone and quality of the writing for the rest of the book.Granted, I didn't finish this one, but I feel at 226 pages I gave it a fair shot. She has wasted years of her life visiting the world's best places in a fog of dirt, self-imposed self-righteous poverty, and marijuana smoke. I don't think her book deserves to waste any more of my time."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"This book is seriously annoying. The author comes across as a hyper hippie who just wants attention, is ignorant of pretty much all subjects such as geography (when she first hears of Surinam, she said the only Nam she'd ever heard of was Vietnam) and politics (she doesn't know why it might be dangerous to monitor political elections for a Southeast Asian military dictorship). The only thing she cares about is having a good time in the most \\"LOOK AT ME!\\" manner imaginable. She comes across as the kind of person who would keep interrupting other people to tell them her crazier/better/funnier story. She also comes across as the kind of person who can't be single for more than 15 seconds. And then it's a serious bummer for her when she's saddled with a kid and can't party like she used to. I am not too picky when it comes to train reading, but this was a waste of time."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"To be fair, Halliday's writing is quite good. She does rather well describing her misadventures and traveller's mistakes throughout Asia. For all that, though, it was more than a bit much to read her grottier than thou stories of hasty and much overdue washups in bathroom stalls, numerous exhaustively described accounts of dysentery, and constant attempts to score dope in the Third World. Her praise of Brits on the dole travelling in Asia chafed a bit, as well. Halliday comes across as the nightmare travelling companion. As for the hilarity, I'll have to take a pass."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I saw someone reading this on the train. Great title, great cover, great idea.Poorly executed. I guess I expected something like \\"Dave Barry Travels Abroad,\\" but this book wasn't nearly as cuttingly clever as it thought it was. The vaginal references were embarrassing more than amusing, and a lot of the bathroom humor made me cringe more than laugh. It read more like a self-indulgent travel journal by someone's teenage kid trying to sound worldly and adult. It had some good bits, but not a book's worth."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"If you've ever traveled on the cheap or bummed around Europe or Southeast Asia, this book is for you. If you've ever wanted to do so, it is equally a great read for Halliday is so matter-a-fact, so immodest and honest about her bumps, failures and travel successes, that you will laugh out loud at the recognition of what it is to be a true traveler as opposed to just a tourist on a one week holiday abroad. She is an outrageously amusing narrator."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"No Touch Monkey contains the travel tales of Ayun Halliday as she reminisces about her pre-motherhood days of traveling around the world on a budget. She backpacks around Europe and Southeast Asia, takes a trip to Paris with her mother, and an overland trip through Africa. She also includes a somewhat odd final chapter in Scotland with her baby daughter.Her travel accounts are amusing, as she writes about situations every traveler has encountered but no one ever wants to talk about, including encounters with stray dogs, awkward moments in foreign bathrooms, and the stinkiness of backpacking clothes, as well as some more unique experiences.Her cheapness got on my nerves in some cases (geez woman, you're only in these places once, maybe save some of your drug money and buy a decent meal!) but overall it was funny and honest. She wasn't afraid to step outside the tourist zones and get the real flavour of the countries she visited and met many interesting locals by doing so. If you've never been backpacking, you'll appreciate her wit and humour, but if you have, this book will have you longing to pull out the old backpack and set off on an adventure!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Transporting me to places I would love to see, but perhaps aren't brave enough to travel to, I loved this book. I've always had the ambition to see the whole world, but finances and an inability to stay in less than modern accomadations have, needless to say, prevented me. Ayun's sharing of her mishaps & pleasures in going to these places have essentially fulfilled my need, and reassured me that I wouldn't enjoy the trips! I admire people who can be so carefree in their travels and so brave. I think any bad reviews are from people who likely enjoy the disney view of the world. Which is of course fine for them. I highly recommend this book to educated, free spririt types, and those who wish they could be (me)!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"As a fellow travel writer, reading \\"No Touch Monkey!\\" caused me to become both excited and desperately envious. Excited because Ayun's clever humor, honest tone, wicked intimacy and brilliant turns of phrase gave me a monster buzz of reader delight. Envious because I have yet to produce anything its equal. As a reader I'm smitten. As a writer I'm jealous as hell. It's been a painful, yet inspiring conflict of interests Ms. Halliday. Thank you!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but what a HORRIBLE disappointment. The title and cover photo were great, not to mention the call-out on the cover from Stephen Colbert (from Daily Show) claiming \\"I laughed hard on nearly every page of this shockingly intimate travel memoir and deeply funny book.\\" The only way I could rationalize that quote in my head is that he was either being extremely sarcastic, or he's a really good friend of the author and wanted to help her out. I LOVE the Daily Show cast and find thier humor so fresh and irreverent that I mistakenly figured \\"if it's funny enough for him . . .\\" Be warned - that quote needs to be taken with a HUGE grain of salt.The author is incrediby whiny and self-important yet hypocritical. There are glimpses of her humanity, but for the most part she puts herself on a pedestal above everyone she encounters - traveling companions included. Nobody is allowed to think differently that she without being scathingly judged. Certainly not a person I'd care to meet. I hope her poor kids pass muster."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Most travel books focus on the places and maybe will include some personal experiences. This book reverses that.Rarely have I read any kind of book where the author is more self-absorbed and impressed with him/herself. I got SO tired of page after page of putting other people down while describing how cool she was. Worst of all were the constant put-downs of her boyfriend of the trip and how much more fun she would have alone. Then, when alone, she managed to have a lousy time as well.Overall, a simply annoying book."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"This book was a waste. This girl is far from a travel author. First rule of being a travel author is to be likable, readers have to want to travel with you while reading your stories. Ayun is far from likable, I kept reading in hopes of hearing she was robbed, kickded off a bus, or ditched by her travel mates. I certainly would not want to travel with her, nor would I read anything else about here so called travels. This girl was nothing more than a cheap tourist who whined about everything and everyone. She did not seek out unique experiences, places, or adventures that come being off the beaten path and away from the tourist centers. I am convinced that she planned her trip using the lonely planet guides and made it a point to hit every tourist trap she could. She is the kind of person who goes somewhere so she can brag that she has been then, as those listening to the bragging hope she chokes on an ice cube. I just wish I could give this book a 0 star rating.Avoid this book and get something by Rolf Potts, Peter Allison, or Bill Bryson.Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari GuideVagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World TravelIn a Sunburned Country"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I'm tempted to cast aspersions upon the previous reviewers and their clearly crap taste in writing, but I suppose I should concentrate how awesome these essays are. And maybe that's the thing the other reviewers didn't get: these are essays, personal essays in the style of a David Sedaris or Sarah Vowell--not a humor column, not genre travel writing. After reading this book, I bought all Ayun Halliday's other books and subscribed to her zine."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"I loved reading No Touch Monkey and seeing diverse parts of the world against the backdrop of Ayun Halliday's tumultuous yet amazingly inexpensive world travels. Set roughly in the late 80's to mid 90's, Ayun tells of her roustabout twenties in the most personal ways. She is not a simple post-college girl gone wild; she is more akin to an American intellectual version of a Mitford sister. Though more like Jessica than Nancy, she shares their sincerity if not their avoidance of the graphic. While many \\"educated\\" women (and men) of her generation were rushing off to pursue MBA's (the degrees and/or the possessors of them) for the sole purpose of lining their pockets, Ayun looked for something higher or lower. Either way, she was looking and she was doing it with far less money than the rest of her peer group has been spending on the monthly upkeep of their SUV or European car of choice.While it is cute, funny and sassy, No Touch Monkey is a wonderful book for the best of reasons: it inspires the rest of us to expand our horizons and denies us the excuse that we can't afford to."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"After getting a recommendation for this book from my friend, and reading Stephen Colbert's plug on the front cover, I was expecting a lot of laughs and entertainment from \\"No Touch Monkey.\\" Well, as I read through it, I kept waiting for the laughs to come, but it didn't happen. I made sure to read the whole book, expecting it to get better as I went along, but ended up being disappointed.I admired the writer's sense of adventure and willingness to try new things as she went from country to country on a shoestring budget, but her methods of describing her trips didn't really catch my attention. She focuses mainly on herself, and how miserable the situations make her feel, instead of describing the events of the trips. That just didn't interest me. I suspect that she might have been having trouble remembering the details of what happened during her travels, and therefore couldn't really include them in her writing. Also, I found her selfishness to be a huge turn-off. She only seems to care about her own wishes, and what SHE wants to experience on vacation. If her boyfriend/traveling companion's wishes don't match hers, then she puts up a huge fuss. For instance, on most of the trips that she took with Greg, they mostly did what she wanted to do, and he went along with it. The one time they partake in an activity of Greg's choosing (riding camels across the desert), Halliday is determined to make the worst of it.When she talks about losing her freedom due to being a mother in the last chapter, I felt sorry for her child, Inky. All Halliday talks about is what a burden Inky is to her carefree lifestyle. Yes, children cause parents to do less of what they'd like to do, but I would hate to grow up being constantly reminded of what a burden I am to my mother. If Halliday didn't want to limit her lifestyle, she shouldn't have had a child. I just hope that Halliday hasn't been taking her resentment out on Inky over the years."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Will someone please recommend me a great female travel writer!! I am somewhat like Ayun to a small degree; have my backpacking experiences that are crazy, have had many travels on a shoestring budget, and had my share of shady characters and illnesses on the road- but she was actually kind of a boring writer who also did not always use common sense. Someone else criticized her shoestring budget or referred to her travelling as \\"poverty\\" travel. Well, I do not know her personal financial situation in the States, but most of us backpackers choose to try to see as much as we can on the road which involves staying in some dives, using sqat toilets (most non-western countries only have these) and we do have to count every penny- she was just living the life of a typical backpacker who is not travelling on her parents dime (I assume this was her situation). I have used some of her same techniques in the past to stretch my dollar such as sleeping in airports (pre-9/11), sleeping in bus stations, couch surfed, and living on the bread, yogurt, and cheese diet. I do not have to be in the Hilton to have a good time and I want to be able to keep as much of my savings for emergencies and enable myself to see as many countries as possible. However, I do agree with her critics in regards to spending her precious money on alcohol and drugs; that is just plain stupid!In my travels, I have witnessed so many fellow hostel mates who cannot seem to go a day without smoking a joint and I agree that is such a waste of money and dangerous. I do not like the attitude that I see of such types who seem to believe that because they are from the West, that they will be exempt from the law. I think that these types should watch some episodes of \\"Locked Up Abroad\\" before setting foot on the plane. She was foolish and very lucky on her journeys in this regard. I did however like her narration of those starving days on the road- the shoestring budget while watching everyone scarf down a good meal. I usually reserve my finances for a few good meals, but she would have encountered some delicious economical meals in some of the countries that she chose.I was hoping to read a funny book about the backpacker's experiences from the female perspective. Hoping she encountered some of the crazy, unique things that us women embark on- ie- marriage proposals from strangers, the need for head scarfs, cat calls, ect... but I didn't get much of that from this book. Her France trip with her mother only entailed a discussion of a fashion show and her eagerness to get home to her boyfriend. Her trip to Amsterdam was somewhat enlightening but still a bit flat. I liked reading the typical swindling that she encountered in India(glad to read someone else who also got in the same type of tourist trap). Her trip to Romania also seemed to give me some insight into the lives and culture of the Romanian college kids. However, I found myself skipping many parts and a bit bored. I was hoping for some more humor and feel for the culture and the locals. Her trip to Edinburgh only involved the discussion of her theater production and child caring problems. Over all, some of this book had a few laughs and good tips and is worth a read if you buy it used. Meanwhile, I will stick to Paul Theroux and Chuck Thompson until I can find some good female travel narratives. And yes, I have read \\"Whose Panties are These\\" and \\"Women's Travel Stories\\" 2008, and most of them were dry as well. So the search is still on!"},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Ms. Halliday has a gift for finding the humor in the lowest of situations - being robbed in Asia, having disgusting mishaps in foreign bathrooms, buying cigarettes from an 8-year-old Vietnamese kid. The book is not a travel guide so much as a funny account of what happens when you're traveling on a budget. Halliday spends a fair amount of time on herself and her thoughts, but then, that's the book's going for. Overall, a pretty funny misadventure guide."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"It has such a cute cover, but as they say, \\"Don't judge the book by the cover.\\" This book is about a young woman and her misadventures, not only traveling, but in dating.I really didn't want to read chapter after chapter of her describing her bad gas, or the farting of her roommates, or how filthy her clothes or body were. I didn't need to hear that she was releasing fluid from all of her orifaces, including her eye balls. Nor did I need to hear how she got drunk or stoned yet again.I put the book down about 2/3 of the way through, and am literally debating throwing it away rather than resell it. It's that bad, I don't want to subject some poor soul to this mediocre writer who sounds like an absolute idiot to have as a travel companion. She makes good, decent backpackers sound like scumbags who mooch, steal and have no idea what proper hygiene consists of.She's not a \\"hippie\\" as she keeps calling herself, she's an unwashed pig who doesn't have the human decency enjoys living like a homeless person as she \\"travels\\". She's a transient, not a traveler. There is a big difference.

While technically it IS a travel memoir, i would implore booksellers to tuck additional copies of this book in with their right-as-you-walk-in displays of &quot;Hot New Non-fiction&quot; and &quot;Must reads&quot;, as well as in the Essay, Social Commentary, Humour, and Poetry shelves.Ayun Halliday is the literary equivalent of the fine artist who can perfectly capture a reclining figure, a cathedral, or a window box of geraniums by executing but a few seemingly effortless, well-chosen brush strokes - except in this case, the reclining figure has a swollen dislocated knee, the cathedral is a frightening squat toilet, and the window box of geraniums is a rooftop of flip-flop stealing, imperious monkeys intent on bullying a hapless dog. (Incidentally, Ayun Halliday also has a gift for the brush stroke, as evidenced in the illustrations in this book, as well as her Rapidograph inkings in her 'zine &quot;The East Village Inky&quot;)I tried so hard to make this book last - i rationed it in small doses as much as was possible, but i finally gave in and let the dishes go unwashed, the phone go unanswered, and the toddler run amok and immersed myself in my armchair, vicariously traveling with Ayun Halliday, and hoping that if i ever get to meet her i won't become horribly tongue-tied and dumb, or prattle endlessly and fan-girlishly on about how much i love her writing."},{"Title":"No Touch Monkey!: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too Late (Adventura Books Series)","review":"Like another reviewer, I have been a fan of Ayun's for years, and have even participated in some of the same online forums as her, so she and her family's antics are near and dear to me. I LOVED &quot;The Big Rumpus&quot; and recommeded it to quite a few people. This book, however, just aggravated me and made me want to throttle her. She painted herself as flakey, naive, and a nightmare to travel with.

Possible. But either way, I think those who claim it to be awful are ridiculous. She does talk a lot about herself, but it's not a travel destination guide. It's a traveling journal of sorts. And if you're relaying your experiences while traveling, I think that it's inevitably going to be a lot about... you.

I'm not sure about this \\"last gasp\\" claim yet - *The Wrong Side of Paris*, Balzac's last novel (recently republished!) is on my reading list - but they certainly are great in and of themselves, *Bette* more than *Pons*, in my opinion. Not to degenerate this work in the slightest: being within the shadow of a masterpiece is close enough for posterity.'Poor Relations' tackles the subject of the individual and its family; but where in *Bette* the poor relation was the spinster cousin, surrounded and revered by her family while she secretly schemed to destroy them, in this novel Pons is the outcast and victim, humiliated by his wealthy relations for his eccentric behavior and mooching ways. For Pons loves food - sumptuous feasts, where he can indulge the demands of his gastronomical addiction - and when his lack of social grace irritates his relatives to the point of banishment, he always wheedles his way back into their hearts with exquisite presents: Pons' monomania extends to collecting the great masterpieces of art, hoarding them away in his private salon where he can bask in the glory of oil and gold. After a scheme intended to permanently set his place at the dinner-table goes awry, however, the old man finds himself an exile, snubbed and refused at the homes of his relatives. The heartbreak - and the stomach-ache - drives the poor man to his deathbed, one hounded by prospective vultures seeking to profit on his jealously-kept collection.*Cousin Pons*, on reflection, is perhaps one of Balzac's bitterest and unrelentingly tragic novels, sharing similarities to *Pere Goirot* in its plot, structure and sharp denouncement of the materialistic bourgeois society that had come in fashion after the July Revolution. Greed, avarice, selfishness, poisonous coveting (literally), corruption, hypocrisy and blackmail all raise their heads in this novel, a gaggle of vipers ranging from the highest of society (the infuriating Presidente) to the lowest dregs (the despicable La Cibot), and all those that scheme in between (the ghoulish Fraisier). Pons and his roommate Schmucke, gentle failures in the game of life, haven't a chance among these beasts: and it is heartache to see the villainous deeds done to these two men for the glitter of lucre and the whiff of prestige. Balzac was never much of one for happily-ever-after, but most of his tragedies have some sort of uplifting resolution, some cosmic vengeance dealt upon at least a few of the miscreants (and *Bette* was probably the most satisfying in this regard); *Pons* refutes this technique, leaving the reader shaken and upset at the circumstances of the conclusion...at the _reality_ of it.This volume is not quite within Balzac's creative pantheon: it's too slim (!), lacking the complexity and the captivating digressions of a *Lost Illusions*; but man o man does that ending work - for the novel, and as a conclusion to one of the most ambitious artistic statements of the past two centuries.Four and a half stars, rounded down."},{"Title":"Cousin Pons","review":"This work, like all of Balzac's works, possesses his style, namely his perceptive insights into a Parisian's sole and the fabric of society during that time. Had these observations been relevent only to Paris of that time (the book takes place 1844-46) this book would not have the impact it does. I can almost imagine any one of these characters existing today, and wouldn't be surprised to open up the newspaper and reading a column with a similar story as this book.It's a great look at what moves people to get ahead and step over other's who are more vulnerable. It is as if Balzac is saying that society is an extension of the apt phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\". The characters that ultimately succeed in this novel are the one's not with the most talent, but with the drive to get ahead in society. There are limits however, as a character who oversteps the laws of society is ultimately punished.It is a painful novel to read as the characters who are the most sensitive and least versed in the ways of society suffer the most . Even a relatively minor character who is noble becomes withdrawn and pessimistic as a result of his inability to be charitable. It's definetely not an uplifting read, but it is very well written nontheless."},{"Title":"Cousin Pons","review":"I'm a Balzac's french fan.&quot;Cousin Pons&quot; is one of my favourites Balzac's novels.This novels speaks about art (music, paintings, ...), social relationships in a family and in a flat, and over there of FRIENDSHIP.The friendship between Pons and Schm&uuml;cke is the most facinating aspect of this novel (may be it's more than a frienship : a platonic love ?)."},{"Title":"Cousin Pons","review":"This wholly engrossing masterpiece is as profound as it is entertaining. Balzac surely is not only one of the best writers of all time but among the smartest people who ever lived. The delineation of character(s) and observation of the human condition are literally staggering."},{"Title":"Cousin Pons","review":"This is absolutely one of my favorite novels by Balzac; his character invention soars to new heights with his creation of Sylvain Pons and his best friend, a German named Schmucke.SPOILERS AHEADPons is the protagonist; a musician who almost made it to the big time, but didn't pay enough attention to his orchestration. Now he gives private lessons and conducts a theatrical orchestra, and barely gets by.Pons is dominated by two very different manias. The first is collecting small works of \\"bric-a-brac,\\" which includes such masterpieces as a fan created by Watteau for Mme Pompadour, which Pons manages to acquire for ten francs (it is worth thousands). His private museum contains 2,000 wonderful works of art, probably worth a million francs all told --- although he would never dream of selling them. His second mania, alas, is gourmet dining. He has learned, and learned well, what truly fine food and wine taste like, and he's addicted. He became addicted when he was a popular young musician during the Empire, but now he has fallen to the status of a mere parasite, a \\"hanger-on,\\" a poor relation. At the time the story opens, he is barely tolerated --- almost openly mocked --- at the homes where he appears \\"just at suppertime.\\"Like many Balzac novels, this one does not keep you in the dark about exactly how much money each character has, in property and income, and the eternal Parisian struggle for more money and higher status. Suffice it to say that Pons' richie relatives look upon him as a fool until a crisis puts him at death's door, and the richies learn about his magnificent art collection. Understanding nothing of art whatsoever, these ignorant clods understand a million francs perfectly, and so the last days of Sylvain Pons must be devoted to defending his property against those richie relatives, who reveal themselves as unscrupulous thieves.It's not cheerful reading, but tragedies rarely are. \\"Cousin Pons\\" will leave you shivering with horror, and asking yourself, \\"Is this really what mankind amounts to?\\"If you enjoy this, there is a lot more excellent stuff where this came from!"},{"Title":"Cousin Pons","review":"I just downloaded this to my Kindle. Much to my chagrin I found it is not in French as advertised but is an English translation."},{"Title":"Campaigning with Crook, and stories of army life (March of America facsimile series)","review":"Charles King is an interesting read. His &quot;Campaigning With Crook&quot; follows his months of hard service in pursuit of the Indians who brought Custer to earth.Their campaign was brutal. Across 1500 miles of trails, 2,000 cavalry and infantry tried to bring their foes to battle. They had to travel light to have any chance of catching their supple enemy. Light travel meant no tents, light equipage, few overcoats, scarce rations and no oats for the horses. As a result, men traveled and slept in the rain (once for eleven consecutive days), shivered in the cold and drenched themselves in northern streams and rivers crossing fords that reached chin level in some places. Only two Indian fights of note occurred for all their efforts and in the end the men lost over 2/3 of their horses to overwork, starvation and the need to fill their own bellies (we do learn that captured Indian pony meat is much sweeter and less stringy than horseflesh).This is a fascinating book. The author is in high bravado and so are his comrades. War work, the actual fighting, seems like sport to some of the men. Bravery and coolness under fire abound. Convinced of the nobleness of their cause, these soldiers suffer none of the introspection, war weariness, confused morality or lack of certainty of their right that one associates with modern war literature (at least as portrayed by Charles King). The first person account of hard life on the trail is a wonderment; I couldn't imagine many people, professionals or otherwise, suffering the privations and elements today the way these soldiers did -- they almost expected such chance and treatment and bore up incredibly well in body and attitude.The book gets a few dings for what now reads like antiquated writing style (and very prevalent in late 1800 prose. I admit this is probably because a modern audience has not been raised on this style). Pasted together like associated magazine articles (I wondered if this had originally been issued in installments), the story is jumpy and disconnected in many parts. There is much dialogue with the reader that is largely absent from today's writings (ie, &quot;and now, dear reader, I take you to an incident that could have been mentioned before during the description of our starting out, but for want of brevity of that narrative was delayed until now....&quot; -- I'm paraphrasing this, but examples like it are found throughout the book).This is a book rich in details that fascinate. It is not well assembled and lacks flow, but for first-person historical remembrance, it does a nice job."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink: With More Than 500 Recipes for American Classics","review":"John Mariani's comprehensive work includes many recipes, from the simplest to those involving many steps and considerable cooking experience and skill, from Colonial foods to present day dishes. I found this book fascinating, sat down and read it cover to cover, and rose up eager to try some of the recipes.There were dozens of varieties of fish listed, including many I have never cooked or eaten. There were colorful colloquialisms, some of which would be familiar to modern readers, others from long-ago times.A great general interest book, Mariani's work especially appeals to \\"foodies\\" ( one of the contemporary terms he defines). Readers will gain an appreciation for the bounty of the 21st century American table as well as an understanding of how our foremothers creatively improvised with basic ingredients like cornmeal and molasses.This book is highly recommended as a page-turning overview of the surprising sophistication and palate-pleasing delights of American cuisine!"},{"Title":"The Chamberlains of Brewer","review":"As an admirer of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, I've read much on his life - but most books deal precious little with the rest of his family. This book fills that gap. Although I felt that his relationship with Fanny &amp; their children was slighted just a bit, that has been covered in other sources. I found Ms Loski's look at the other Chamberlain siblings - particularly Sae, who is mentioned so little in other works, &amp; the hapless Thomas - to be enlightening, fleshing out my picture of JLC by placing him in the framework of the people he best knew &amp; loved. I've recommended this book to several people already. Thank you, Ms. Loski!"},{"Title":"First Grade Brain Teasers","review":"This is an excellent workbook for beginning readers. There are simple activites (dot-to-dot, mazes, completing patterns) for children who aren't yet reading and more complex activities (word jumbles, word finds, complete the word) for children who are already reading.

Not that they're missing--if your main goals are to find the hottest clubs and bump into Tara Reid, consult the detailed nightlife guide, complete with names of A-listers known to put in an appearance.But if you want to get a true taste of America's Caribbean capital, work your way through the itineraries listed in Schmidt's book, which run from \\"Hot and Cool Miami,\\" a celebration of South Beach and its trendy ilk, to \\"Cl&aacute;sico Miami,\\" a three-day retro cruise to the great beach resorts and Latin restaurants that made Miami famous in the 50s and 60s, when the Rat Pack, James Bond, and a wave of Cuban immigrants transformed the town into the Magic City.Unlike many guidebooks, Fun Seeker's Miami gives you the dirt instead of the Chamber of Commerce spin. As a former South Florida resident, I have to say it's right on."},{"Title":"The Fun Seeker's Miami: The Ultimate Guide to One of the World's Hottest Cities (Night + Day Miami)","review":"\\"We're locals, and sometimes it's easy to get out of touch with hotspots.

It has quickly become a staple reading selection amongst my friends and family. Though I don't trust much of the advice, especially about the traditional medicinal remedies, it is a great book to pick up for a few laughs and makes an excellent conversation starter.Much of the book is straight forward simple sentences. I am a Home Ec. teacher and have read several passages to my junior high students to get them to think outside the box about resourcefulness.

Her children must have felt so comforted to have this book to guide them in their lives as well. And I would imagine what a treasure this would have been to hand to a new bride as she started her life with her husband. Lydia M.

Well, this is the book for you!Okay, modern American women may not be able to relate (because we aren't just housewives anymore and because of technology), but Mrs. Childs does have matter-of-fact advice that many of us need to pay attention to. For example, she speaks positively of education being the foundation for all children, and she also speaks of assigning children chores (what are those?) to complete with their brothers and sisters (because other children can or may be bad influences if they have nothing to occupy their time). I enjoyed how she spoke of living under our means, which is something that we rarely do in a world full of credit cards and 0% financing for blah, blah number of months. She believes that sickness should be the only \\"extra\\" spent out of the strict budget.With this being said, I would have enjoyed reading this better if the information was better organized (I read about preserving eggs and her trip to the mechanic all in one paragraph).

It is, without doubt, THE best book of its kind.The American Frugal Housewife is fascinating on a variety of levels, not the least in that Child wrote the book with the emphasis on &quot;AMERICAN.&quot; Other such books existed at the time, but they were written in England and for English women. Child was one of the Transcendentalists who were huge advocates of personal self-discipline and restraint, but believed to their core the importance of fighting for what they knew to be right. It wasn't just a religious fervor -although Child's Christianity, like that of Catherine and Harriet Beecher Stowe, was extremely important - but a belief that the still relatively new United States had a unique destiny that set it apart from the rest of the world, specifically the old, decrepit world that was Europe.Child was no blindfolded nationalist, however. She saw the flaws and contradictions that bound the new Republic. Child, like many other Transcendentalists, was a fervent abolitionist and a proponent of women's equality, and worked all her life toward achieving those ends. Even with its problems, Child was an ardent American. She saw Americans as a unique race of people with a unique and powerful destiny. Americans, she believed, were new and unique, and that the American destiny was far different from the degenerate, rotting hulk of Old World Europe.So what does all this have to do with the American Frugal Housewife? Well, Child wrote the book specifically to address AMERICAN houswives and what she knew to be their unique problems and issues. It's much more than just a recipe book; it embodies Child's philosophy that the only way toward virtue was self-restraint and sobriety, and that the way to tutor the new nation in these values was by teaching the nation's housewives - the hand that rocks the cradle, Child believed, did indeed rule the world.The new nation was becoming prosperous, and Child saw that then, like now, people had a difficult time learning how to restrain themselves financially. One part in particular has to do with how mothers should raise their daughters. Child believed they should teach their offspring the virtues of frugality, that it was better to put savings &quot;out at interest&quot; and earn wealth from it, then to indulge in the latest fad - one in this case being something called a Brussels carpet. As new brides went out to set up their household, Child lectures at how they drive their husbands to bankruptcy by embracing fads and trying to keep up with the Joneses.Other, cheaper types of carpet &quot;will answer just as well,&quot; Child wrote. She also recommends using cheap illustrations, nicely framed, as wall art, rather than going overboard to buy the latest European style.Some of the best sections are on frugality. Child was the &quot;Hints from Heloise&quot; queen of her day, and she's got a solution for everything that could possibly beset the early 19th century housewife. The interesting thing, as others have noted, is how so many of her tips still work so well.I don't know that I'm ever going to need her instructions on how to brew my own soap in a backyard kettle or how to keep my homemade pickles in a barrel from turning soft, but I did get a burn mark out of an antique chest by using rottenstone and oil, just as she prescribed.What's rottenstone, you ask? Well, you can buy it at a hardware store, but if you want the recipe, buy the book! It's a fantastic window on early American life, but the sound advice inside, about not getting into debt and how to &quot;do up&quot; your brass so it doesn't tarnish, is still amazingly useful.I guarantee you'll become a Child fan, just like me! :)"},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"I bought this book at a Revolutionar War event this past weekend and I've read it 3 times already (Purchased Sunday, and it's now Tuesday morning). My husband can't believe that I can't put this down. But I find it fascinating reading.

I actually like this more than Tightwad Gazette which tries not to be too preachy. Not Mrs. Childs, she's my kind of charismatic and she's preaching to the choir!

I mean fragments of time as well as materials. Nothing should bethrown away so long as it is possible to make any use of it. However trifling that usemay be; and whatever be the size of a family every member should be employed either inearning or saving money.\\"This is for the most part, the only proper \\"Introduction\\" that the reader encounters when starting \\"The American Frugal Housewife, for Ms. Lydia Maria Francis Child plunges right in and begins dishing out advice left and right, providing a veritable flood of information. She advises, for example, that children not be allowed to frolic about until 13 or 14 years of age.\\"This is not well. It is not well for the purses and patience of parents; and it has astill worse effect on the morals and habits of the children. Begin early is the greatmaxim for everything in education. A child of six years old can be made useful andshould be taught to consider every day lost in which some little thing has not been doneto assist others.\\"Other advice consists of how economize and how keep what you have in good repair. Everything from stockings to hearths, from apples to sausages. In addition, there is medical advice, and instructions on how to cook a variety of foods. Everything from porridges to cows brains, herbed wines to pies.STEWED PRUNES.Stew them very gently in a small quantity of water till stones slip out. Physiciansconsider them safe nourishment in fevers.BEANS AND PEAS.Baked beans are a very simple dish, yet few cook them well. They should be put in coldwater, and hung over the fire, the night before they are baked. In the morning, theyshould be put in a colander, and rinsed two or three times; then again placed in akettle, with the pork you intend to bake, covered with water, and kept scalding hot, inhour or more. A pound of pork is quite enough for a quart of beans, and that is a largedinner for a common family. The rind of the pork should be slashed. Pieces of pork alter-nately fat and lean, are the most suitable ; the cheeks are the best. A little peppersprinkled among the beans, when they are placed in the bean-pot, will render them lessunhealthy. They should be just covered with water, when put into the oven ; and the porkshould be sunk a little below the surface of the beans. Bake three or four hours.THE SKINNY:::To be perfectly honest, there is some sound advice here. Some of it inspired by Ben Franklin, and some of it coming from friends and articles read by the author.I found this an absolutely fascinating book that gives some wonderful insight into the daily life of early American families. We get to see what the concerns of housewives were, and how life was lived amongst a class of people -- the less well-off -- that is frequently overlooked by historical studies.Ms. Child was born in 1802. She was raised by a strict Calvinist father and later she married a lawyer who proved to be an improvident dreamer who at times was imprisoned for his debts. As a consequence she knows frugality quite well.The American Frugal Housewife is extremely well written, and was extremely well received at the time it was first put up for sale. In fact, it was republished 27 times between 1835 and 1841.I HIGHLY recommend this work to students of history and those who are interested in early American life.As for the \\"Kindle\\" format, I must say that this particular version comes with 'highlights', some of which are definitions. These are easy to access or ignore. (Which is why I can't tell you what they all are.) Being a FREE book it's hard to complain, but I should note that there are images from the original book that don't appear in the Kindle copy. They pertain to the parts of animals -- rumps, chops, etc.-- and aren't particularly valuable.

Still it was still fun to let your imagination run wild dreaming of doing some of these things. Also if you are going to do some reading about history why not go directly to the source on that particular subject?

Much of the joy lies in the relating of family events that occurred at its time in history. For example, children learned about growing up by participating in some adult activities (working at knitting scarves and making placemats that would benefit the whole family.) The greater lesson was, of course, learning their own importance in society. Furthermore, in a world where the future has become more uncertain than usual, this book reminds us that our ancestors did not have the conveniences of prepared foods like mayonnaise and jello but that with a minimum of research we can duplicate the same goodness.

I've been in this business since '76 on the drafting board, and since '86 with CADD (Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design) and have watched the skills of knowing how to draft (a distinct language of its own) and the elements of design and engineering fall by the wayside in general as the focus now by our educators and companies is more about learning to and running a CADD program, making a picture than following the skills and practices of drafting, design, and engineering. Students today need to get back to &quot;walking&quot; (learning drafting) before they &quot;run&quot; with a CADD program. This book addresses what is necessary to create drawings and design the parts as they should be. I highly recommend it to anyone conscientiously wanting to really learn to do the job right and/or to hone their skills."},{"Title":"Engineering Drawing and Design","review":"As an all-inclusive reference on Drafting theory and practice, this is as good a book as any. However: Having used it as a teaching text, I found an inexcusable number of mistakes in the end-of-chapter exercises. The dimensions simply don't stack up! My advice: Go over them yourself first, time permitting, before assigning them to your classes. Perhaps (hopefully) this has been/will be corrected in later editions. Also: Board drafting is a dying art. Thus, while opening chapters on theory and sketching methods should be retained, more emphasis must now be placed on CAD (not &quot;CADD&quot;); specifically, 3D CAD and downstream processes."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"It's a simple, yet profound, premise: When a contract killer makes a move to kill an innocent preacher, the preacher offers unconditional forgiveness. The killer, Solomon Long, is rocked by the man's reaction.\\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\" is a story of redemption, couched in the organized crime scene of Kansas City. At times, it reads with the vivid focus of a comic book; at others, it delves deeply into the wounds that many violent men carry. We meet Det. Tom Griggs, a man numbed by his job and impotent to change his own marriage. We journey with \\"Solo\\" through his ugly childhood, his contract-killer career, and his guilt-driven attempts to come clean. We bump into criminal low-lifes, attractive female cops, and greasy crime lords.In the story's conclusion, most of the pieces come together in a moving, yet understated manner. Although the plot thread concerning Solo's mother seems to unravel, the action never flags, and Chris Well stays true to his characters and their inner struggles. Like a classic comic book (think \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"Batman\\"), this novel is so cleanly drawn that a non-reader could enjoy it, yet so deeply developed that a voracious biblophile can find numerous things to appreciate.In the growing world of Christian fiction, \\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\" proves there is room for new styles, gritty characters, and stories that can move us without sermonizing. Keep bringin' it, Mr. Well. We're ready for more!"},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"I came across Forgiving Solomon Long while searching for interesting and edgy books that didn't leave me feeling like I needed a bath. I appreciate how Chris Well does not shy away from the darker sides of life yet does not dive into them himself. As a Christian artist I am often faced with the difficulty of remaining true to life without losing my principles. Chris Well's approach is a great study in how to accomplish that. I also liked all the theater and Shakespearean references."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"What a fun ride.

Many side characters have enough \\"color\\" to them that they stick in your head.The action moves along briskly. Occasionally I would like a little more detail in settings, but it all works.The thing I appreciate the most is that the author doesn't make all of the conclusions for you. You have room for interpretation at the end. But don't worry, it's not a philosopical tome, but an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Forgiving Solomon Long opens with the title character gunning down Father Mac in a confessional booth since the priest was part of a group standing up to mob boss Frank \\"Fat Cat\\" Catalano.And Christopher Well builds steam from that promising beginning, whipping up a magnificent concoction that is part Sopranos, part Carl Hiaasen, and part Elmore Leonard. But mostly, it's all an edge-of-the-seat romp through Kansas City's underworld - with the breaks off.Well creates some unforgettable characters here. None is better drawn than Solo Long, the clean-freak hitter. But there's also mobsters bantering about The Odd Couple, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Singing in the Rain and just about everything in between. And then there's detective Tom Griggs, whose single-minded pursuit of Fat Cat is coming at the expense of his marriage.That opening scene is also your first hint that Forgiving Solomon Long isn't your run-of-the-mill CBA fiction. But body count - and don't kid yourselves, there are dead bodies strewn all over the Midwest by the end - isn't all that separates Forgiving Solomon Long from most works coming off Christian presses.It is edgy and contemporary and hip, without compromising its Christian message. It's also a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"\\"We distrust fiction that has a palpable design on us,\\" as someone wrote. In my view, all fiction has a palpable design. That said, there are designs and there are designs. The designation \\"Christian Fiction\\" cannot help but suggest a design, but this isn't the place to wrangle over the merits of such a heading. I'm quite aware that some readers read just for such a design, although I read a work, if I do, apart from or in spite of it. A blurb on one of Well's later works reads \\"Even though it's an amusing romp, it's not light on spiritual truths.\\" I would far rather reverse that and say, \\"Even though it's not light on spiritual truths, it's an amusing romp.\\" Spiritual truths you can get anywhere, but only in fiction an amusing romp.That said, this book appears to be, no matter how lightly handled, crime fiction, which is certainly not my cup of tea. I am perhaps the only one in America who would rather see Little Steven in the E Street Band than The Sopranos, but there it is. So I probably did read it for the amusing romp in spite and not because of its gangster setting. I also hasten to add that while Well has been criticized because his toughs don't cuss, I wouldn't read the book if they did. A great many believers have written without being saddled with the rubric of \\"Christian fiction\\", including Flannery O'Connor, Madeline L'Engle and C.S. Lewis. I venture to suggest that Well need not wear it either.This book reads fast, and is laid out like a play, with three acts. I like short chapters and this 280 page novel has, believe it or not, 124 of them. It's a clever way to write. While there is an omniscient narrator, as it were, each chapter shifts characters and points of view, with new members of the dramatis personae being introduced in the early chapters, as in a play. It's a very visual book, almost written as a screenplay, with, curiously, the most visual part left out: descriptions of the characters. Because of this, it's slightly difficult to follow the story and keep track of all the players. If it were a screenplay, however, which is to say a movie or TV show, that wouldn't be a problem, since the viewer would see the actual characters.Arguably, some of the gangsters are cardboard cut-outs, but others are quite astute. Well obviously enjoys dusting the crops with pop culture references, including a few covert ones as when someone echoes a Carole King song or a preacher is named for the rock band, Daniel Amos. This is a first novel, so far as I know, and if other reviewers are to be believed, they get better. But even here Well has tackled the all- important element of the novel, which is finding a consistent tone and voice, and solved the problem of how to sustain that voice for the length of the book. Needless to say, I can't wait to read the next Well- written novels."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"This debut novel for Mr. Well I found was fresh and a very entertaining read. I thought the story moved along at the right pace and there was just enough action to make be turn page after page, but not too much that the action scenes were down right boring. The character were believable, which I always enjoy and in summary I hope that the author will release another sequel as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"This was a neat book--and yes, that is a compliment. I was hooked from the first line. \\"On the last day of Father Michael's life...\\" The main character Solomon Long is a professional killer with some interesting little quirks. While Solo is connected to the overall story, his part is a story within the story. The supporting cast of mobsters, cops, FBI, and ordinary people all make for a very interesting mix of the good the guys versus the bad guys. Like most mobster related entertainment, the book has a pretty high body count, but is not excessive and is not gory in its details. The story moves along well and is filled with action, drama, and decisions. My only complaints were, the leak in the police department was given away disappointingly early and I wish a little bit more time had been spent on little Frankie. He was a very likable character and it would have been nice to see him more involved in the story over all. Wells' story telling style is unique and very enjoyable. If you're looking for Christian fiction with a sense of humor, look no further."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"A great read, intriguing, a book that I didn't want to put down! I have given it as a gift twice already. Chris Well has an incredible way of getting into the minds and personalities of his characters. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"I picked out this book because Chris Well was recommended on Eric Wilson's website. I'm glad I found it. This is an action-packed story full of thrills and suspense that sucks you right in. Well's uses short, concise chapters in his writing, and this method reminded me of James Patterson's novels.Chris Well does the unthinkable with this plot: He tells a great mob story that is saturated with Christian themes of forgiveness, redemption, and hope. Well tackles the daunting job of portraying the rough mobster lifestyle, without being inappropriate in his writing. While there is violence, you will find no bad language or sex, and Well reminds us that a great story doesn't need those elements. The various pop-culture references throughout the book bring a clever dose of relevance that really sells the story.The characters are real and they each struggle with darkness in their own ways. Solomon Long is a dark, complex character that the reader is drawn to, despite the fact that he is a killer for hire. Detective Tom Griggs is a good cop, but a bad husband, and you will find yourself loving and hating him. Frank \\"Fat Cat\\" Catalano is a bigger than life villain, and Well does a wonderful job of portraying his nastiness.This is a great story of redemption told in a setting that many Christian writers would shy away form. I'm glad Chris Well decided to jump into the deep end and show the world that a good story can be found in the most unlikely of places. I'm looking forward to Well's next book, Deliver Us From Evelyn."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Solomon (Solo) Long is a killer for hire. His current employer, Frank Catalano, better known as \\"Fat Cat\\", is a mob boss who wants to take out all six leaders of the community coalition trying to clean up their city and take it back from his control. Detective Tom Griggs and his task force have been investigating Fat Cat's operations, trying to find that chink in his armor to bring him down.Solo handles his assignments without problem until the murder of his third target, a pastor who grants Solo his forgiveness in his final moments of life. This turns Solo's world upside down as he struggles with reconciling memories of his past with the forgiveness & redemption he catches a glimpse of through the pastor's words. This plus the bible that mysteriously keeps appearing opened to key passages such as \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" in his motel room start Solo down a different path in life. And the changes in Solo begin to have far reaching repercussions that bring the story to a climatic ending.Chris Well certainly taps into an unusual storyline for the Christian market and I enjoyed the book. However, at the end I found myself not satisfied. Other than Solo I felt I didn't have enough information on the other characters to truly care about what happened to them. Tom Griggs and his wife Carla have marital problems and are a major part of the story line. Yet very little is truly revealed to explain what got them to the place they are in. And, considering that Fat Cat thinks the community coalition is important enough to bring in a hit man to take out the leaders, very little is shared about the people in the coalition and what they have done or plan to do in the community.I recommend this book for the message of forgiveness and redemption that it brings. I think it could have been even better with more depth to the characters."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"If you like comic books, Shakespeare, and Pop TV, and if you like a spiritual theme in your genre fiction, you're going to have fun with the story of a tormented Hit Man who meets his Damascus Road when he takes out a true-believer preacher. Allusions and echoes of King Lear, Macbeth, Julius Caesar (loved his use of an iconic scene and utterance) abound. There is clearly an homage to Raymond Chandler, too. At least, that's what The Mir thinks.What happens when someone who's had a messed-up childhood and vicious adulthood comes face to face with a logic-defying human act of benevolence? Well...when God intervenes, you cannot remain the same. Forgiveness of this sort, of the kind Corrie Ten Boom--holocaust survivor-- offered a Nazi, of the kind some Rwandans offer the killers of their kin, of the kind the parents of murdered children offer some death row inmates...the kind Christ offered from the cross. This is not a power one can dismiss lightly. This novel follows one man's life-and-soul changing encounter with forgiveness.A book doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyable. I give this 4 1/2 stars in terms of technique, because there is a pacing issue and less emphasis on the snappy style toward the latter part, and here and there I hit some rather jarring jumps in POV (from third to omniscient and back) that will irritate those of you who are POV purists. (I know many of y'all, so if you're one, calm down. Buy the book. Enjoy it.) Those are really very minor quibbles. The start and middle of the novel are entirely crisp and snappy and energetic and wholly enjoyable. The ending is awesome. I give it 5 stars in terms of premise and style and freshness. This is some good writing!Other reviewers have told you about the story--neighborhood anti-crime effort, cops trying to break the local mob, a hit man taking out activists, a detective with marital woes and a big \\"don\\" to bring down, treason of various sorts, mayhem and self-discovery. I just want to tell you to buy this book and read it now, because Chris Well has another one coming out this year, and you really want to enjoy this debut novel before his next one hits the shelves.This is a CBA author to watch. He's got a blog you might want to check out (especially if you're interested in Christian fiction in general) at http://chriswellnovelist.blogspot.comAnd, if I recall correctly, this book was chosen as one of the Top Ten Booklist Christian Novels of the year. Not too shabby.Mirhttp://mirathon.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"This is a crime story with an unusual twist. It is an entertaining read with some really good character development.The main character in the story is Solomon 'Solo' Long, who is a mob hit man. One of his victims is a pastor. As he is dying, the minister tells Long that he forgives him. This simple act of Christian forgiveness rocks Long's world. He is profoundly affected by this event and tries to make some things right as the story progresses.I believe this is a debut novel for Chris Well and it is a good first effort. He does leave a couple of loose ends along the way and the action at the end is a bit anticlimactic in comparison to the earlier parts of the story.He does a very good job of interjecting a bit of Christian worldview without coming across as preachy. He also ties in some contemporary culture and even some Shakespeare throughout the book. I thought the best part was his character development of Long.Overall, this is a pretty entertaining read and a real rarity - a crime novel without tons of foul language or other non essentials."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Solomon Long, hardened hit-man, and former caged freak-in-the-basement is unleashed on a community and haunted by his last victim.Wells' strength lies in the parables he creates and recreates, drawing from Shakespeare, The Bible and Punky Brewster, to tell a story that neither stays with, nor strays far from, the source material.This debut is a worthwhile read, with a cinematic flow. Sure to please fans of Noir, Tarantino or the Coen brothers."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Chris Well is BRILLIANT!!! I cant stress that enough! He's also pretty fearless, tackling things that most Christian authors would shy away from, especially because many would think that a Christian audience wouldn't be so accepting of the scenarios and characters that Mr. Well presents us with. They're wrong, of course.Highly original, entertaining, thought provoking, suprisingly classy, and excellent characters, event the cliched ones. (and there are plenty o' those!)I did have a slight problem with the 'little Frankie' storyline. I was really interested, but then it didn't seem to go anywhere. Anyway, I'm ordering Deliver us from Evelyn next! ^-^"},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"As an aspiring novelist I read a lot. Reading is one of those tried and true ways of developing your own writing skills. For a while now I've been hearing about Chris Well and his novels. Friday I found a copy of Forgiving Solomon Long at a local bookstore and snatched it up. Of the two novels Chris currently has on the market, this one's premise intrigued me the most.What if a hitman took down his latest target (a pastor) and the victim forgave him with his dying breath?Whoa!Forgiving Solomon Long is the story of mob hitman Solomon Long who's called in from 'back east' to take out the six members of a coalition of clergy and business owners. The coalition is stirring up trouble for the mob in Kansas City.Crime boss, Fat Cat (but now to his face) has set his eyes on bigger fish to (quote unquote) fry and the coalition is becoming a bother.KC Detective Tom Griggs wants to take down Fat Cat in the worst way. His marriage is on the rocks as well.Solo, as Solomon Long is called, comes to town to do the dirty work. He kills a couple of them. No problem. Then he starts tailing his next target. Pastor Fresno Jones. The man rattles Solo's cage from the get go. Solomon has had a troubled life. His mother took the fun out of dysfunction. He now carries a newspaper clipping in his wallet about a woman who might be about his mother. She now sits in prison for child abuse.Pastor Jones is a different breed of Christian than Solo has ever known. He watches as Jones interacts with and touches the lives of the forgotten of the inner city in real and tangible ways. The two men even have a chance encounter which rattles Solo even more.When the deed is finally done and Pastor Jones lies in an alley dying, he extends two things to Solomon Long. Forgiveness and a Bible. Solo freaks and runs away. At this point the intensity in the story really ratchets up as Solo goes off the deep end.You'll have to read the book to see what I'm talking about. I've tried to make this review as spoiler free as possible.Chris Well is good writer. His style of short, choppy sentences reminds me of my own writing in my novels. Wonder if it drives his crit partners as crazy as it does mine? For me, this style works because it helps to move the action at a faster clip. While I was reading the novel I could almost here Joe Friday's narrative voice. Spooky. The dialogue makes for real characters too. I could really hear the accents in my head as I was reading.The one critism I'd have for the writing is that some times I felt I was being told a lot of things rather than being shown them.I cared about the characters. Chris Well took a big chance, in my opinion, telling a story from the POV of a killer. I've read that writing a story with a bad guy protagonist is a risk because the reader has to care about them as they are the one leading you through the story. Chris Well pulls this off. I cared for Solo from page one, as well as all the other major players.I didn't care for the ending of the story. I felt like there was more to be said and in such a short novel (280 pages) there was certainly enough room for it. It wasn't that there were loose ends left untied. I just wanted more about the resolution of things. With the body count in this story I doubt there will ever be a true sequel.Chris Well has another novel, Deliver Us From Evelyn and another on the way just after the first of the year. He also has a website and blog. Check him out. I can't wait to read his other novels. The fact that he was able to stretch some bounaries in the CBA gives me hope that I can do the same with my own writing.I'm off to find a copy of Deliver Us From Evelyn."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Solomon Long is a hired killer who works for anyone who will pay him. He has come to a small town outside of Kansas City, Missouri to do a job. After all, he is doing these victims a favor. His theory--You Live, You Suffer, You Die and death is a gift. Hired by Fat Cat, the local crime boss, he has come to town to kill five people.First target goes well for Solomon a.k.a. Solo. Second was not a problem either. The third was Fresno Jones a priest, who is kicking off the neighborhood clean-up committee. Father Jones has a deep-rooted faith and knows that the Lord is with his parishioners and will help them get this town cleaned up. When Solo kills him, the Father's last words were, \\"I forgive you.\\"This shakes Solo Long to his roots. He believes the Father is still with him. He rethinks his whole life from the time he was small and his mother kept him locked in a cellar to 'spend time with Jesus,' to this current job. He is now tormented by those he has killed--and can no longer kill.The head of the unit that investigates the city's organized crime is Detective Tom Griggs. He is very unhappy in his marriage since the loss of his daughter. He goes to counseling because his wife wants him to--although generally he isn't even there mentally. He knows the murders are done by a pro, and right under the police department's nose. Tom becomes obsessed with solving them.The action is fast and furious throughout the book. Solo's revelation that he can no longer kill takes a surprise turn when the mob goes after Detective Griggs' wife. To add to the detective's problems, someone in his office is an informant.Chris Well ties all this together in a great action thriller that even has scripture versus throughout applicable to the different events.Armchair Interviews says: This is a story of forgiveness and the effect that forgiveness had on its recipient, all wrapped up in an exciting thriller."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"I had a hard time getting into the story at first because of all the different points of view, but soon I settled in and enjoyed the book. Solomon Long, or Solo, is a hit man brought in by Frank \\"Fat Cat\\" Catalano, Kanss City mob boss. Father Mac, a Catholic priest and Pator Fresno James, of Mercy Street World Mission Church have recruited local business owners to fight against the mob's protection racket. They're cutting into Fat Cat's income, and he figures, kill a few of them and the rest will fall into line. Solo is doing a good job of earning his money, until he kills the right man from Fat Cat's point of view, but definitely the wrong man as far as Solo is concerned. Sure Pastor Fresno James is dead, but apparently he still has a personal interest in Solo. What happens when a hit man loses his ability to kill? Solo tries to leave town, but no man walks away from Fat Cat Catalano. Forgiving Solomon Long is a thought provoking story about a man who devoted his life to killing and now is on the run. . .from God."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Chris Well, editor of Homecoming Magazine and contributing editor to CCM Magazine has written his first novel- Forgiving Solomon Long, published by Harvest House. This fast-paced, gripping tale of organized crime and murder on demand will grab your attention and squeeze it like a grungie toilet-sponge. The twist in this tale is not \\"who done it\\" but forgiveness--costly forgiveness--offered at death's doorstep. You may find yourself, as I did, not wanting to forgive Solomon: but it was for the unlovable and unforgiveable (us) for whom Christ died-- and at death's doorstep extended to us His forgiveness--costly forgiveness.Forgiving Solomon Long, a great summer read.Check out my blog at http://www.vickitalleymccollum.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"The year is 2005, but I go back to the beginning of the year, checking out what new releases might be of interest to myself. My favorite authors all had new stuff coming out. But then you look to some of the new titles and you can clearly one thing. These guys have taken a chance. They have their first published novel out in the market. Chris Well was one of a few that I chose to take a chance with. Chris Well is one that is very well (yeah, hence the last name, amen?) worth taking a risk reading. Chris Well will be on my list in the future!I can easily say that early on the title, cover, EVERYTHING attracted my attention. There was one thing standing in the way. This isn't my first choice normally. And the way it was presented, I had to wonder, \\"Will this actually work in the Christian market?\\" Yes! I even wondered if it would be interesting with the short chapters, but it was. Made you keep turning the page!You take a contract killer, add a few BAMS! Take a detective, Tony Griggs, and add some good stuff, along with a message that delivers grace. And once I got into it, it was easy to accept that cusswords weren't a necessity to make this a good read! I could see a few times where Well kind of had to improvise, but he did it without compromising his message.So, you take some comic books, add a few Jolly Rancher candies to liven up the flavor, and sit back, and enjoy this read. You know you'll run into some good surprises as the smoke clears, and you won't be sorry. As you hear in some gangster clips, this is an offer you can't refuse! Oh yeah, Chris Well put his chips on the table, and it payed off."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"Too often Christian writers settle for being imitative instead of original. Thankfully Chris Well is not the Christian answer to Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen; his voice and style is unique. While fans of Leonard and Hiaasen - and Shakespeare - will enjoy this novel, it will be because it presents a fresh and funny take on the mob scene, instead of the all-too-typical over-moralized Christian fiction knockoff.Forgiving Solomon Long is the story of a contract killer who develops a conscience late in his career. It's also the story of mobsters who quote everything from Chekhov to The Odd Couple (and, unfortunately, Punky Brewster), pop decongestants like tic-tacs, and try to find their way in a world that has stopped making sense. And then there are the men and women of law enforcement, whose worlds are beginning to fall apart as well. All of it told in a fast-paced, funny style that will keep you laughing as the chapters whiz by.My only problem with the book comes at the ending. In an effort to keep things fast-paced, description and imagery are sacrificed, characters are forgotten (although that seems somewhat intentional based on a literary observation by one of the gangsters), pop culture references all but disappear, and the story gets stretched a bit thin. It's not enough to detract from the brilliance of the first three-quarters of the book, but still - bada-bing - there it is.If you're looking for a book with engaging characters and an entertaining plotline, that deals with issues of faith without preaching, and tackles Shakespearean tragedies (e.g., Macbeth, King Lear, Julius Caesar) without being overly blatant, pick up a copy of Chris Well's breakout first novel. You might not forgive yourself if you don't."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"I found the story and the action to be quite good. I was always wondering what was going to happen next. However, there was something about the story line that was disconnected. In some areas, more information was needed. In other areas, the information didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the story. At the end of the book you are kind of left hanging. It just seemed like the author decided he'd written enough and he was done. In my opinion, a little more work and it could have been a great book."},{"Title":"Forgiving Solomon Long","review":"I was really disappointed by \\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\" by Chris Well.

It was just too much gore. In places I found it disgusting.I also did not like the writing style. There was flopping back and forth between present tense and past tense which made the reading clumsy. The dialogue was contrived, and inconsistent to the characters.To me there seemed to be no main character. The scenes flip back and forth erratically. It found that confusing. There also were far too many character and none were very well developed. The assassin \\"Solo\\" had a horrific childhood which seemed to be revealed as the book progressed, but Solo's mother quoted Scripture and murdered his dad (said the dad was taken away like Enoch) yet she had buried him in the basement. She also abused her child severely, which the author seemed to relish dribbling out the details.None of the characters were consist, nor believable. The crime boss's family was a stereotypical \\"Italian mob\\" family, but I found the descriptions bogus and superficial.I am sure somewhere in the book is some message, but I found the book so poor that I could not finish it.

Some of his most important work was printed in journals, out-of-print anthologies, presented at scholarly conferences, or available only in pamphlets. Fortunately, many of these essays are now collected in The Logic of Action (2 volumes), one of Edward Elgar's Economists of the Twentieth Century seriesVolume 2 of the Logic of Action is subtitled &quot;Applications and Criticism from the Austrian School.&quot; The range of these essays is simply incredible, and it's hard for a reviewer to know where to start. So, I might as well start with the first essay, Freedom, Inequality, Primitivism, and the Division of Labor. As usual, Rothbard's reading is immense and he briliantly refutes the claims of primitivists that specialization is somehow the cause of our problems rather than the necessary result of an increasing standard of living. In fact, communists import an almost religious devotion to their communism that Kautsky even said that under communism &quot;[t]he human average will rise to the level of an Aristotle, a Goethe, a Marx. Above these other heights new peaks will arise.&quot;Another brilliant essay is the last, Karl Marx: Communist as Religious Eschatologist. Rothbard gets to the crux of the matter: &quot;The Key to the intricate and massive system of thought created by Karl Marx is at bottom a simple one: Karl Marx was a communist.&quot; As against those who would downplay Marx's religious drive to create a utopian society, Rothbard shows that Marx is just one of many &quot;religious eschatologists.&quot;In between these two essays there are 20 more. Whether it's &quot;value free&quot; economics, free banking in Scotland, marginal productivity theory, or Henry George's fallacies, Rothbard always has something brilliant to say. I really enjoyed The Myth of Tax &quot;Reform&quot;, which should be read by every conservative activist. &quot;Every economic activity that escapes taxes and controls is not only a blow for freedom and property rights: it is also one more instance of a free flow of productive energy getting out from under parasitic repression. That is why we should welcome every new loophole, shelter, credit or exemption, and work, not to shut them down but to expand them to include everyone else, including ourselves.&quot;As David Gordon and Hans-Hermann Hoppe state in their introduction: &quot;No introduction can do justice to the vast range and insight of Rothbard's work. Anyone who completes these two volumes will have an indelible impression of Rothbard's greatness.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Logic of Action II: Applications and Criticism from the Austrian School (Economists of the Twentieth Century) (v. 2)","review":"Murray Newton Rothbard (1926-1995) was an American economist, historian and political theorist. He was a prominent exponent of the Austrian School of economics in this country and a key figure in the American libertarian movement. His major work in economics wasMan Economy and State One Complete Volume. This posthumous collection (see alsoThe Logic of Action I: Method, Money, and the Austrian School (Economists of the Twentieth Century) (v. 1)) contains a diverse collection of his writings on economics.He suggests that \\"Both the passive and the tribal aspects of New Left culture were embodied in its idea of the 'Woodstock Nation,' in which hundreds of thousands of herd-like, undifferentiated youth wallowed passively in the mud listening to their tribal ritual music.\\" (Pg. 17) He suggests that \\"It is high time, then, for those who cherish freedom, individuality, the division of labor, and economic prosperity and survival, to stop conceding the supposed nobility of the ideal of equality...\\" (Pg. 27)He admits, \\"Unions... are theoretically compatible with the existence of a purely free market. In actual fact, however, it is evident to any competent observer that unions acquire almost all their power through the wielding of force...\\" (Pg. 41) He later argues, \\"civilization itself is a process of all of us 'free-riding' on the achievements of others. We all free-ride, every day, on the achievements of Edison, Beethoven, or Vermeer...\\" (Pg. 86)Arguing that \\"a bureaucrat... is in reality not paying taxes at all. His tax payment is a bookkeeping fiction\\" (Pg. 100). He suggests that \\"The point of a neutral tax is to affect the income 'distribution' and all other aspects of the economy in the same way as if the tax were a free-market price.\\" (Pg. 101) He criticizes the idea of \\"phony tax shelters,\\" on the grounds that \\"Who is equipped to look into my heart and mind and find out if these losses are 'genuine' or not?\\" (Pg. 112)He insists, \\"The basic libertarian principle is that everyone should be allowed to do whatever he or she is doing unless committing an overt act of aggression against someone else. But what about situations where it is unclear whether or not a person is committing aggression? In those cases, the only procedure consonant with libertarian principles is to do nothing... it is far better to let an aggressive act slip through than to impose coercion and therefore to commit aggression ourselves.\\" (Pg. 137-138)He recommends the \\"abolition, not the privatization, of such operations as... all regulatory commissions, central banks, income tax bureaus, and, of course, all the bureaus administering those functions that are going to be privatized.\\" (Pg. 208) He asserts that \\"Society cannot own anything. There is not entity called society; there are only interacting individuals.\\" (Pg. 303)Rothbard's writings are always thought-provoking and controversial; and this is another excellent collection of them."},{"Title":"Poems Before and After: Collected English Translations","review":"Miroslav Holub, Poems Before and After (Bloodaxe Books, 1990)Surrealism is rather like Death by Chocolate. It's great in small doses, but if you get too much at once, you're going to get sick. Poems Before and After, which is for all intents and purposes the Collected Translations up to 1990, is verging on the too much.Miroslav Holub is a brilliant writer, one of the same generation of Eastern European writers that produced poetic giants Charles Simic and Vladimir Holan. And Holub's best work easily stands with Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk or A Night with Hamlet (see, e.g., Vanishing Lung Syndrome). And there's no denying that the work here is, for the most part, fantastic. Absolutely lovely stuff. But there's so much of it, and Holub's work is so dense, that the reader is best advised to read this book over a space of months, dipping into it now and again before retreating and mulling over what he's read. This is one for your permanent collection; you'll be going back to it over the space of years. However, if you're a Holub newbie, as most folks are, you're probably best advised to start with one of the single collections and work your way up to this one. ***"},{"Title":"His 1-800 Wife","review":"Catherine Carson needed a husband so her mother and sister would get off of her back. She needed to come up with a plan that would make her marriage look real, but she would only have to keep up with the charade for 6 months.

She couldn't put her finger on who the voice belonged to, but knew it was familiar. Catherine runs into her childhood enemy Jarrod Greene. Jarrod has been away for a while. When he speaks to her, she is reminded of the voice on her answering machine. Jarrod is indeed the caller from her 1-800 line. Catherine talks Jarrod into becoming the lucky husband.Jarrod was in love with Catherine. It seems he has been in love with her since their early teen years. He tries to prove to Catherine that maybe being married to him forever isn't too bad.His 1-800-Wife was not something you would normally see from the Mystery &amp; Intrigue Queen Ms. Hailstock.

I completed this novel within a 12 hour span and it definitely left me wanting more. This story of Catherine Carson installing an 800 number to find a husband &quot;in name only&quot; so that she can put a stop to her sister's and mother's matchmaking. Catherine's goal was use the 800 number as a tool in order to find a man, marry, then divorce within six months, which would result in a reprieve from her mother and sister. Unfortunately one of the callers to her 800 number is from Jarrod Greene, a man from her youth, to be exact her next door neighbor who made her life miserable as child (who at every turn plagued her young life with practical jokes and pranks which embarrassed her to no end) but Jarrod was also the brother/&quot;boy&quot; friend she never had, who had been living in England for the past five years and has just returned home. Little did Jarrod know when he called 1-800 Wife that Catherine would be the voice he hears on the answering machine. As fate would have it Catherine and Jarrod marry with the understanding that after six months each would go their separate ways and all parties would free to do as they pleased and their families would leave them alone. Unfortunately things do not always go according to plan, Catherine and Jarrod have had feelings for each other since they were children, the pranks and the jokes were just a cover and now with the two being married and thrown together in close quarters the love that for years had simmered below the surface has now exploded into a love which cannot be denied.

Written by people with current knowledge and years of experience in the breed. Everything from history to references for breed clubs,meanings of title abbreviations, and lists of recent years winners. Discusses care of the dog from birth thru older ages, and even talks about different dog activities. A must read for both novice and veteran alike. This is my favorite book of the 15 Rottweiler books that I own."},{"Title":"The Rottweiler: Centuries of Service (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","review":"This is an excellent resource for anyone thinking about or who currently owns a Rottweiler. There are lots of beautiful photo's and useful information."},{"Title":"The Rottweiler: Centuries of Service (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","review":"I really love the \\"Best of Breed\\" series and this book is exactly why.This is a very fun read, full of great pictures and stories that really let you connect with the breed and dogs in general. The section on taking care of an elderly dog was warm and almost heartbreaking, and the photos of people surrounded with these dogs on the beach, with children, etc. reminds us why we love these animals so much. I found the history of the breed a great introduction into more research I did on my own on domesticated dogs in the western world, and the mastiff type breed. I did the research just for fun because I found the accounts of Alexander the Great, similar breeds such as Anatolians, Great Pyranese, Tibetan Mastiffs, and the like so fascinating and fun to read. To think that big, slobbery, floppy-eared pooch has such a rich history really is amazing.Anyone who is interested in learning more about Rotties or had a Rottie they loved will love having this book."},{"Title":"The Rottweiler: Centuries of Service (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","review":"For many years I have raised & trained in obedience, Rottweilers. I have quite a few Rottie books I have accumulated through the years but recently, when I was waiting for a new puppy, I read \\"The Rottweiler: Centuries of Service,\\" & found it to be the best one ever. It went past the confirmation of these wonderful working dogs & into the working, health & temperament more thoroughly than I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Howard Diet","review":"The Howard Diet has a number of good points, but relies heavily on information copied from government food tables as a filler for the book. Dr. Howard has a program that might work for some patients, but is too permissive for others, including the weekend when the patient can eat what she pleases. The compulsive eater will probably undo all the good done in the first four and a half days with overeating in the last part of the week. Unlike some diets, his is not dangerous, but will probably not be effective long-term. His charts on body mass index and other information he supplies are accurate and well documented. He has an upbeat writing style and expresses himself well, but this book needs to be re-written and revised to make it one that can compete with other diet book authors. The present edition just doesn't quite have it."},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia: 2002 Classic Shirt-Pocket Edition","review":"As an internal medicine resident this book is absolutly vital to my life and practice. In nearly three years I have not once gone to work without it in my pocket.

Whether you are a medical student or a resident, you need this book!"},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia: 2002 Classic Shirt-Pocket Edition","review":"As a resident I have found this book to an invaluable tool for physicians, 3rd and 4th year medical students. It packs an incredible amount of information into such a small package. The book includes every medication, dosage, formulation you'll ever need. It includes a number of obscure drugs as well as off label indications, which come up quite often, not included in epocrates. I had to dig up this classic after being left high and dry by epocrates a number of times. There are a number of charts such as BSA, ACLS, safe drugs during pregnancy that are great as well. Overall this book is definitely worth the pocket space."},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia: 2002 Classic Shirt-Pocket Edition","review":"A friend and I were talking about this book. \\"Obviously,\\" he said, \\"it was written by a clinician.\\" This is extremely high praise.I discovered this book several years ago. Now, I don't go to work without it. I can look up any drug in the world within seconds (the index helpfully tells you whether the listing is at the top, middle or bottom of the page) and find out basically everything I need to know: what class of drug, what it's used for in clinical practice, how it's metabolized, can you give it to pregnant women, can you give it to breastfeeding women, what's the relative cost, what's the usual dosage and route, what's the DEA classification . . . and also read a sentence or two along the lines of \\"One or two things you should know about this drug:\\" for example, terazosin: \\"First dose at bedtime to avoid orthostatic hypotension.\\"To compress the entire PDR into 127 pages that fit into your shirt pocket is a truly impressive work of scholarship. Saunders comes in a close second, and the Washington Manual a distant third. The Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia is, in my opinion, the most useful medical book ever published."},{"Title":"Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia: 2002 Classic Shirt-Pocket Edition","review":"This is THE most essential, and most used book I own.

So, just get it!(Warning: this book has a kind of addicting potential - once you use it, you are gonna use it daily)."},{"Title":"Mastering Java 1.1","review":"This is a very good book for those who want to get a good start on learning Java 1.1. Even for those with no OOP experience, it teaches you abstraction, interfacing, overloading, and the basic Java syntax. As far as all that goes, it's great.When it starts getting into AWT, it starts jumping ahead a bit too quickly. AWT is something that needs lots of coverage and lots of examples and explaining, and Mastering Java 1.1 is lacking here. The on-CD examples sometimes lack the .java source, and in some cases, the .java sources are riddled with compile time and runtime errors, or trivial typos, like getId() instead of getID(), proving that the publisher (or whomever) didn't prooftest them. I've even caught the book using a few deprecated usages such as resize() instead of setSize().Overall, not a bad book at all. I've got a firm grasp on the basics and non-visual part of Java, but I'm frustrated with it when it comes to learning AWT: GUI, animation, images, etc. This book leaves the reader to desire something a bit more complete and less in a hurry."},{"Title":"Mastering Java 1.1","review":"We used this book to teach an introductory Java course for experienced programmers. Without exception the students didn't like the book. They felt they really couldn't learn from it--topics are covered too quickly.

The explanations and interpretations of select words and passages offer clarification and deeper meaning, and make the text come alive. It should come as no surprise that the Hertz Chumash is a synagogue standard."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"It is a tradition among the Jews that when one reads the Bible one should also read the commentaries of our ancestors as well. This masterpiece of Jewish commentary by the late Chief Rabbi of Great Britain J.H. Hertz incorporates not only the thoughts of Rabbi Hertz himself but also those of Rashi, Saadya and many other Jewish sages.I have been picking this book up and browsing through it, or referring to it for a specific point, for almost thirty years. If you can only have a few books in your Jewish library this book ought to be one of them.A further point. I, too, used to think that Hertz's commentary used Hertz's own translation of the Pentateuch, the Five Books of Moses. In fact, Hertz'z book uses the normative (in his day) 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation.Hertz's approach is decidedly Orthodox, but you don't have to be Orthodox to appreciate this work, which I believe will be in print as long as there are Jews who speak English. And if you are thinking of a gift for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah or for Chanukah I can't think of a better choice than this one."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"The distilled wisdom of the ages in about 1000 pages - no one could do it better. I have read through this volume every year for several years and never cease to discover new insights. Recommended it for both Jewish and Christian students of the holy scriptures."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"J. H. Hertz's edition of THE PENTATEUCH (The Torah) and HAFTORAHS is a solid work of scholarship that demonstrates considerable work and shows clarity. This book is obviously useful for devout Jewish people, but Christians (Catholic and Protestant) plus those who have no religious affiliation but have an interest in biblical history and literature will enjoy this book. A knowledge of Hebrew is useful, but the book is so well done that it is not absolutely necessary.Rabbi Hertz, the editor of this book, did not accept the Documentary Hypothesis interpretation of the Torah and Hebrew Bible or what is known as the TANAKH. For devout Christians, this is also know as the Old Testament. As this reviewer stated elsewhere, he does accept the Documentary Hypothesis or at least some form of it. In spite of these differences, this reviewer still considers Rabbi Hertz's book as scholarly, detailed and exceptionally well written regardless of differences of opinion.Most Torah commentaries are written in Hebrew with English translations for those who may not have a command of the Hebrew language. Rabbi Hertz has the English translation in a parallel colume which makes reading and cross reference easier which is a convenient aid. Rabbi Hertz has excellent notes at the bottom of the pages to provide explanations of the text which is of considerable help in interpreting the Hebrew text and English translations. Rabbi Hertz was honest in that if he were not exactly sure of the original Hebrew, he admitted this and provided alternative explanations.The Torah sections of this commentary have the Haftorah sections interspaced with the books of the Torah (Genesis,Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). The Haftorahs were readings from the Prophets which the rabbis interpreted as reflecting the ideas of the Torah. The Haftorahs are accurately placed where they belong for the Sabbath Readings including holidays and Yom Kippur. For those who attend or want to attend a synagogue, this book is a useful guide to following the readings that the rabbis or assistants use.Another interesting quality of this book consists consists in the notes at the end of each book of the Torah. Those who are interested in biblical history would find these notes interesting, useful, and informative. These notes provide introductory historical background to the text and Jewish History. For example, Rabbi Hertz had an interesting note of persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe which helps explain Jewish devotion, tenacity, and courage which readers would find interesing very thoughtful.Rabbi Hertz showed intellectual and historical honesty in the last sections of the book. He quite fairly included non-Jewish sources and books that would be useful to readers. Obviously, Rabbi Hertz cited Jewish sources which he divided as Ancient Versions and Commentators, Modern Versions in English, and Mondern Commentators, Tralslators, and Writers on Bible Subjects-Jewish. He further included non-Jewish sources in a section titled Modern Commentators, Translators, and Writers on Bible Subjects-Non-Jewish. Such honesty and fairness impressed this reviewer.Rabbi Hertz provided a Chronological Table of historical events in Ancient Biblcal History. Readers can follow this table by referring to sources mentioned above to enhance their knowledge of the Hebrew Bible (The Tanakh)as well as learning more history. The index at the of the book is suprisingly good. Readers can easily locate sections of the book and the Torah with this index.While Rabbi Hertz was a traditional Jew and rabbi, he was not a biblical literalist. For example, he explains the Creation Story very effectively and intelligently without insulting those who interpret the Creation Story literally. He patiently explained that the original Hebrew portrayed these events as poetry and as allegories rather than as strict literal interpreations. One must realize that the original Tanakh or Old Testament was written in Hebrew and Aramaic and not English.THE PENTATEUCH AND THE HAFTORAHS is highly recommended to serious readers and students of the Bible and biblical history. One reviewer mentioned the Plaut TORAH COMMENTARY which this reviewer has and reviewed elsewhere. Both of these commentaries are worth the price and make for thoughtful reading. One's religious affiliation and belief should not preclude anyone from examing this commentary as well as the Plaut volume."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"Is this the second best rendition, in Hebrew of the Torah with a side-by-side English translation, and provided with commentary, or is it just a matter of taste? According to my taste, the best version, and most modern, is &quot;The Torah&quot; by W. Gunther Plaut. You may read my review of that version, which I recommend when considering the purchase of this book.For the record, the Pentateuch is another name for the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, the five books of Moses.This book is most commonly used in the sanctuary of the Conservative synagogue, as compared to the Plaut volume, which serves the same purpose in the Reform synagogue.I have both volumes side-by-side on an honored place in my living room. I recommend both. However, to my taste, Plaut is 'first among equals.'Postscript: Don't be fooled by the title; Plaut includes the Haftorahs similarly to Hertz."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"The Hertz Chumash has been with me for as long as I can remember. Shaareh Tefillah Shul in Troy, New York had the Hertz Chumash and its translation of the Chumash, and its great commentary taught me then as it still teaches me now. I every week read the Parsha both in Hebrew and English from it.The Hertz commentary is a wise and generous one. It is filled with ' Yirat Shemayim' The Awe of G-d, and yet at the same time open to wise words from non- Jewish sources. It exalts and inspires . And its introductions to each book of the Torah are also of great help .It is still a great commentary to be learned from though it should of course be supplemented with others which go into greater detail in many areas."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"The best and the worst thing about the Hertz Chumash is that Rabbi Hertz is not afraid to be a cheerleader for Judaism: for example, early on he takes on both atheists and Biblical literalists, squaring evolution with religion by explaining that the Torah is about the \\"ascent of Man\\" rather than stagnation. Because of Hertz's willingness to blend modernity and tradition, his Chumash has long been accepted by both Orthodox and Conservative congregations (though unfortunately it is less popular than it once was in both, as more sectarian competitors have gained \\"market share.\\"Once in a while he is a bit too much of a cheerleader for my tastes, and some of his points don't wear as well now as they did in the 1930s when he was writing. But nevertheless, the Hertz Chumash suits me better than any of the leading Orthodox Chumashes: it has more commentary than Aryeh Kaplan's translation, is less inclined towards fanciful legends than Artscroll, and is easier to follow than the Hirsch Chumash."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"I discovered this book 30 years ago, and it remains one of the treasures of my library. Hertz's notes render the wisdom of the Old Testament accessible to non Hebrew speakers, and is invaluable in offering the Jewish perspective of many passages that Christianity has reinterpreted. Reading the notes and explanatory chapters is sitting at the feet of the sages; one feels like one is truly discovering the Torah for the first time.I assumed when I bought the book that it would be of interest primarily to Jews, but a Pentacostal friend quickly disabused me of that notion. I have shared it since with many other Christian friends, and they all promptly bought copies. There simply is nothing else out there that gives such fascinating insight into the Torah in English, while being so very accessible in style. If you buy only one religious book (besides the Bible), this should be it."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"A good resource addition to use for the reading cycle.

You can read the Hebrew, but at the same time have the English translation present. GREAT!"},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"I am glad that I finally bought a Torah, and one of such good quality. The Hebrew words are impossible for me to pronounce, but the pronunciation is not necessary, nor does knowing what those Hebrew word mean. The book is of very high quality, and easy to understand. I carry it everywhere, and never want to stop reading it. I can not say that about any other book that I have read, including the Bible. Never having a Torah before I do find it difficult to turn the pages because I am not accustomed to reading a book from back to front, but the difficulty I believe is more out of fear of tearing the pages than anything else."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"This book may be old, mine is the 1958 edition, but the insights into the Hebrew from reading Genesis alone, have revealed new insights and perspectives that I simply overlooked in previous studies and from other commentaries. Truly inspiring. I am not Jewish, but Christian, and this book is really helping me enjoy the opening books of the Tanach once again. One of the best books I have ever bought."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"Great and easy to read. Don't agree with all the commentary, but the mix of historical reference and Jewish rabbincal teaching is an invaluabe resource. I recommend this for anyone who wants deeper understanding and historical commentary in the Tanak. Not saying all of it is accurate, but all is useful to aquiring an informed position on the meanings of the tanak."},{"Title":"The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"...I'm a Christian.

I had several books that I would check out of the library over and over again. This was one of them. I loved the setting at the turn of the century, the pictures in the book, etc. Then one week this book was listed in the Scholastic flyer that used to come around. I was so excited because I would be able to own this book, instead of having to give it back. I have very few of my old books, so recently have been checking them out of the library. I just re-read this one, and it brought back so many fond memories!"},{"Title":"The Funny Guy","review":"This book was one of my favorites as a kid. It's set in the turn-of-the century US. The main character is a little girl whose mom is seriously ill and whose father is preoccupied. She has no true friends, instead taking comfort in reading books and writing stories, and is teased mercilessly by the popular kids who call her \\"The Funny Guy.\\" The story is well-written and the characters are realistic; the ending is believable and also satisfying. The historical setting is interesting, as well, and just shows that cliques of little girls have not changed much in a hundred years."},{"Title":"The Funny Guy","review":"A childhood favorite that I thought might feel dated when I reread it recently, but it is a compelling read. I'm surprised that Disney never made this into a movie. Perfect for kids of any age - even those of us who just think we're still kids."},{"Title":"The Perfect Fool","review":"The jester's cap on the cover of this novel captures some of the book's feel, since Brian, its 'perfect' main character is held up a total 'loser' in the deepest sense. The handsome stud with his high-paying job gets lost on his way to a mountain resort and ends up in an isolated cabin with five very weird people--and no phone, electricity, or even mirrors! The five oddballs are wonderfully depicted. They entertain themselves by telling stories, each one of them a poke in the eye of Political Correctness and the whole idea of 'perfect' people. The best thing about the book is that it completely avoids a preachy, self-righteous tone. In fact, the narrator constantly pretends to be on Brian's side, though in fact the whole point is that our culture's values and trends are extremely shallow and silly. The ending, which I won't give away (I hate when people do that!) will knock your socks off. If you like to laugh, and if you think our culture is definitely on a downhill slide, you will find this book extremely amusing and insightful."},{"Title":"The Perfect Fool","review":"This really strange (in a good way) book really took me by surprise, it's like no other novel I've ever read. It starts out fairly normal with a young man going off for a weekend in the country but he ends up stranded at a cabin with five people who turn out to be five of his ancestors from different periods of history (sorry if I spoiled part of the plot!), so the book is basically their values confronting his. Fortunately, it is not preachy and never takes itself too seriously until the very end, which I won't spoil, because it really does have a pretty solid moral message underneath all the wacky conversations these characters have. The main story includes stories that the characters tell each other, and a couple of them were good, one a bit draggy. One thing that was nice was that the story actually has an appendix where the author explains some of the odd words and customs referred to in the book."},{"Title":"The Perfect Fool","review":"I did not finish it. A man gets lost, and is helped by strangers, who are having a party, and telling stories. The stories are morality tales. The first story is about a boy who does something wrong and claims the consequences of his actions are not his fault. He joins with others like him to change his action from being thought of as wrong to being thought of as right. What is the significance of this story? How does one apply this story? Are there examples of this going on today? I wish the author would add a chapter to explain this. I would read that chapter, and skip the rest of the book. If the story means that \\"Man has a propensity to excuse his own behavior\\", why not just say that?"},{"Title":"The Perfect Fool","review":"I think this book does what a great classic like Gulliver's Travels does, namely, make you laugh and think about human ethics at the same time. So I call it a Comedy of Morals. This too-perfect main character, the attorney Brian, has everything a man needs, except the ability to laugh at himself. (Trust me, before I married I met LOTS of these guys.) He is totally out of his element when he is stranded at a house with five really lovable (and weird) characters. My favorite is the supremely ugly little German fellow, Jubal, a fool in the best sense. During the course of one night, Brian gets a crash course in not taking himself so seriously. It's a fun book, thoroughly entertaining, and I couldn't wait until the end when (I hoped) the story would reveal just who the characters really were, and why they were there."},{"Title":"The Perfect Fool","review":"I got hooked on this book when I opened in the bookstore and read \\"To begin with, Brian was perfect.\\" Any book that starts like that has to be comic, and this guy is so NOT perfect it's funny. Brian is a success by normal standards but totally nothing on the inside, which he finds out when a major storm ruins his weekend plans and strands him with some wayout people in the boondocks. He thinks the people are psychotics, and I admit I did too until the final chapter, which surprised me even more than the ending of The Sixth Sense. (Don't worry, I won't give it away!) The stories within the story are great fun too, but mostly I liked the conversations between the five characters, kind of witty and comical, but loving too."},{"Title":"Real Americans Admit: The Worst Thing I've Ever Done","review":"I first saw Ted Rall's work in &quot;Might&quot; magazine.

Eda Goldtein and Maryellen Noonan are to be congratulated for their extremely helpful book on short-term treatment that applies psychodynamic and psychosocial theories and treatment principles to brief treatment. This is the first social work text that presents an integrative perspective to short-term work that is highly applicable to clients who come for social work services in agency and private practice. The book is user friendly and contains clear guidelines for short-term work and numerous rich case examples. This book is excellent for students and trainees, beginning workers, and for those who are seeking a clearer understanding of short-term treatment with a broad range of clients. The authors have not only given general principles an techniques but have applied these to work with special populations and to family and group modalities.

Buy it, sit with a box of donuts, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Gilding the Lady","review":"I'm always excited to see a new Nicole Byrd book, but I was especially eager for this one, after meeting Clarissa in the previous book, Vision in Blue.In Gilding the Lady, Nicole Byrd takes the long lost sister of the hero of her previous book, who'd ended up in a nasty orphanage and was then sent out to work at a young age--lots of abuse, etc. Her brother finally found her and rescued her in the last book, and now, at 19, she's got to try to re-learn how to be a lady. A reckless earl sees her in a dispute with her governess on the street, and his friend bets him that he can't make her the toast of the ton.There's also a murder mystery and the ongoing search for the natural father of the heroine from the previous book & her brother (hero of a yet earlier book).It's a really nice series, and by the end of this book, we've picked up several more connections who are begging for their own books.The good:The mystery. Clarissa and Whitby join forces to discover who murdered the former matron of the foundling home, a murder that implicates Clarissa.The humor. A staple of Regency-era romances is the witty dialogue, and Gilding the Lady is no exception.The series connections. In contrast to many romance series, characters from previous or future books don't just make token appearances, they're integral to the story. There is also an ongoing series plot that ties the books together.The bad:While Gilding the Lady does give you enough information that you can read it without having read the other books in the series, you will get more out of it if you've read the others.The wonderful:Watching Clarissa regain a sense of her own worth, Whitby mature from the heedless, devil-may-care earl into a caring, thoughtful hero. As in all the best love stories, the romance between them is both a cause and a result of their personal growth.The verdict:Gilding the Lady has Nicole Byrd's trademark blend of romance, mystery, wit, and sensuality. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gilding the Lady","review":"My advise is to skim through the first five to six chapters -- they're a bit slow going and repetitive. However once you've breached the sixth chapter mark, \\"Gilding the Lady\\" becomes a very enjoyable and fascinating read about a young woman fighting to put all her old fears and insecurities behind her and save herself from an unjust accusation of murder.Although Clarissa Fallon was born a gentlewoman, her life has not been an easy one -- growing up in poverty, she was first, sent to an orphanage when her mother died and her elder brother, Matthew, was thought to be dead, and later sold into servitude. Except that Matthew was not dead. And when several years later, Matthew, with the help of his new wife, Gemma, finds her, Clarissa really thought that all her troubles were behind her. Except that Clarissa is finding it to be exceptionally hard going trying to adjust to her new life of luxury, feeling very much a fraud, and fearing that someone will recognise that she was once a servant and make her and Matthew the laughingstocks of the ton.And then one day, Clarissa sees the matron of the hellish orphanage that she was sent to in one of the fashionable streets of London. Clarissa confronts her dragon, only to have her run off after a fierce face off. And when later the ex-matron is found murdered, Clarissa finds herself high on the suspect list. But this time, Clarissa need not fear facing the world on her own. For now she has Matthew and Gemma on her side, and unexpectedly the worldly Earl of Whitby, who has decided not only to help Clarissa find her place in Society, but to help her establish her innocence as well...Because \\"Gilding the Lady\\" is a follow-up to \\"Vision in Blue\\" much of the interesting bits of this novel (what goes on in a badly run orphanage, poverty, and the kind of difficult lives that servants lead) was a little stale -- esp if you've just recently finished \\"Vision in Blue.\\" And if Clarissa had been a different sort of heroine, the first few chapters of the book might have been a tad more engaging. As it was, even though I tried to empathise with her fears and feelings of inadequacy, I did get tired of her self-pity after a bit. Fortunately, this is where the murder inquiry sets in -- the pacing picks up, the storyline livens up and Clarissa matures almost beyond recognition as she discovers something else to focus on aside from all her shortcomings. It is also at this point that the chemistry, hitherto quite a bit absent between our hero & heroine, starts to sizzle. And I'll say this for our stiff and aloof hero, the Earl of Whitby, he does know how to capture a girl's interest -- that scene in the carriage where he kisses Clarissa's wrist was very sensual. The biggest problem I had with \\"Gilding the Lady\\" however, was that the subplot dealing with Gabriel Sinclair's (from \\"Dear Impostor\\") search for his natural father kept intruding where it really wasn't wanted, and gave this novel an off center feel. I know that this search is what links several of the author's previous novels together, and serves as a set up for her next few books, but I really did think that this subplot intruded and detracted from the overall cohesive feel of \\"Gilding the Lady.\\"Nicole Byrd is an extremely talented author, and I have enjoyed previous novels by her immensely (most notably \\"Robert's Lady,\\" \\"Dear Impostor\\" & \\"The Beauty in Black\\") and once Clarissa pulled herself out of her doldrums and started focusing on something else other than her shortcomings, \\"Gilding the Lady\\" proved to be a rather good read too. All in all a very good 3 1/2 star read."},{"Title":"Gilding the Lady","review":"This book had everything you need to create a good romance: a dashing hero, a beautiful heroine, a person who always seems to interfere with the hero and heroine, and, most of all...PASSION! I found the characters to be multi-dimensional and the author weaves a mystery into the story without slowing it down or interrupting the romantic flow. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Dominic and Clarissa in this very excellent character driven romance. The plot and characters seemed fresh, the pace was quick, and it was a totally engrossing read. Full of enjoyable supporting characters and stories. A very sexy historical romance book.Gilding the Lady was an emotional roller coaster, and I felt all the pain and joy they did. I was so engrossed, I read it in a day. A fast paced book with an intricate plot that I cannot help but enjoy. Gilding the Lady has a strong (but not obnoxious) heroine who is in no way ordinary, a back story which is compelling but doesn't get in the way of the love story, and of course a wonderful hero. Both the hero and the heroine have secrets of their own, which are slowly brought to light by the author, like layers being peeled from a (very good) onion...."},{"Title":"Gilding the Lady","review":"I am so, so glad I didn't listen to the nasty review someone else put up here and just went with my past experience with this author.

And Dominic! He was so sexy and tortured--the perfect hero for Clarissa. I really enjoyed the whole \\"My Fair Lady\\" theme, too! Now I have to go back and read the rest of Nicole Byrd's backlist. This book really made my day. I couldn't put it down and it gave me several hours of romance and escape."},{"Title":"Gilding the Lady","review":"This was perhaps the GAY-est hero ever written. Not that there's anything wrong with that. He's written as a Beau Brummell-esque character, a leading arbiter of fashion but in light of all the \\"intrigue\\" and \\"suspense\\" the author has him dealing with, comes off as slightly ludicrous instead of hot.

The book confirmed my decision to go to Dartmouth, where, as it happened, I spent four years studying in the math building, even though I was a liberal arts major. I simply liked the vibe and John Kemeny's presence. He was there, hovering about, checking on everybody and making the math department at the college the best in the country, building the first computer center, and with Thomas Kurtz, inventing for all of us the BASIC programming language. One time when he encountered me he asked what I was doing reading \\"Lolita,\\" one of the books required in my American literature course, in *his* math building. I said, \\"Well, I want to be a writer and a computer scientist, to master the language of Nabokov and the thinking of Kemeny. I want to stand on the shoulders of giants.\\" Kemeny smiled and shook his head, as if to say, \\"You've got your work cut out for you, young man.\\" Which was true: it took me about one hundred years to do what I'm doing now: writing software code and technical documentation at Apple Inc and, nights and weekends, writing one novel after another, always experimenting with language, voice and imagery.-Tom Maremaa, Author of the Forthcoming novel \\"Metal Heads\\" from Kunati Books in Spring 2009"},{"Title":"Photographing Fairies","review":"Offbeat, quirky--to be sure. This engaging story, set in the early 1920s is great fun to read, due to the slightly off-kilter main character, Charles Castle. He's nave to the point of painfulness, and prone to go charging off in new directions without the assistance of a reliable map. A photographer by trade--and a not-so-good one at that--he is thrown off balance when his London studio is invaded by a small-town constable, Michael Walsmear. Walsmear has photographs that he wants to be validated. Problem is, they're not very good photos, and the subject is entirely improbable.But, to prove that many times we see what we want to see, Castle--after a bit of tweaking--does see the \`fairies' captured on film by Walsmear. Castle then rushes off to see Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of the marvelous Sherlock Holmes mystery novels) who has a bit of a reputation in this field. In fact, Sir Arthur has his own photographs of fairies, for which he is seeking validation.From there, the tale gets \`mysteriouser and mysteriouser' until all the loose ends are satisfactorily tied together. Along the way, while journeying to the small rural village of Burkinwell, Castle is robbed on the train by two very strange characters, Paolo and Shorty, who may or may not be members of the gypsie troupe, with caravans parked just outside the town limits. There's also Esmirelda, the maid-of-all-work at the Starry Night (the local hostelry); the beautiful Linda Drain, wife of Tom, the local minister, who has his own difficulties with which to contend; the Templetons--father Brian, and daughters Anna and Clara--whose garden houses the fairies, and . . .Some books can be easily capsulized; others stubbornly resist. This is one of the latter. It's beautifully written with a wry sense of humor and inquisitiveness not often seen anymore. The setting seems to me to be completely accurate for the time and place, and it is populated by a most unusual and enigmatic assortment of characters. It's an absolutely delicious read!"},{"Title":"Photographing Fairies","review":"With all due respect, I think the raves in other reviews are a bit overstated, unless, like one reviewer, you're someone with a particular interest in faeries.

He had only one year of formal education, and he is the epitome of a homeschooler! All that he learned was largely self-taught.Franklin would be a remarkable man to meet. Some of his accomplishments that I was unaware of include: invention of bifocals and the stepladder, the first to notice that the Gulf Stream was different than the surrounding waters, founded the first circulating library in America, organized the first volunteer fire department in Philadelphia, and made the postal system more efficient. He was the first to diagnose lead poisoning, and he wasn't even a medical doctor!

Her rise from unknown to Queen of Cosmetics is told in a lively fashion with her youthful fascination with beauty to her first forays in beauty salons to her acceptance by the major department stores. It seems that through the sheer force of her personality and handful of potions, Estee Lauder would convert even the most stubborn persons to ardent Estee Lauder devotees wether it was in rhe beauty salon, office or evalator.A favorite story is Estee slipping off her heels after an extremely busy sales day at a department store and going over the accounts. Realizing she is two dollars short of her $1000 sales goal and with a few moments before the store officially closes, Estee slips back on her shoes and springs into action, selling enough product to bring her total day's sales to the desired $1000.One shortcoming of the book is Estee Lauder's decision to not give dates of events unless absolutely necessary. We know when Youth Dew is introduced and the official founding of Estee Lauder but otherwise Estee remains mum. She does mention in the introduction to the book the debate over her age but does not settle the matter one way or another. One can understand her desire to be an ageless woman. The image of a cosmetics queen is one of eternal youth and beauty.

It is clear by the circumstances and incidents covered in this book, that Estee is absolutely a believer in her products--and is an excellent salesperson who WILL NOT TAKE NO for an answer. However, some of the incidents she includes, where she forces potential clients to sample her creams--and they all obtain immediate, miraculous, unbelievable results--are hard to swallow.I have tried many Lauder products, and I cannot say I am aware of just ONE that is able to give someone immediate results--although compared to what was available in 1950, I guess it is possible. In general, a product needs to be used for at least a few weeks to begin to make a difference in one's skin. To hear Mrs. Lauder's account of these incidents, she would have you believe that her products are Godsends that work miracles. If that was the case, by now (50+ years into the business), the entire world would know--and there would be no need for the existence of the myriad other cosmetics companies in the world. Plus, if Estee's products are so wonderful--and do as they are claimed--then why is there the need to launch a new wrinkle cream every year? (If the other ones worked, why continue coming up with something new?)Also, a large portion of this book is filled with so much self-love, as to be sickening at times. Every other page, Estee is talking about her precious oriental rugs, vases, her ability to decorate, to know exactly what to say, which ingredients to include in a formula, etc. The last third of the book is nothing more than her bragging about the many homes she owns all over the world, all of the wonderful views, and what a wonderful &quot;good life&quot; she is living. She has the audacity to talk about the proper way to give parties (making sure you have beautiful women to seat your guests), how she bought up every pink (out-of-season flower in Paris) to make sure she had just the right shade of pink for launching Beautiful, having napkins dyed just the right shade of color, per Pablo Picasso's paintings--for a museum party. All the &quot;little&quot; things are so important, you know....I do have utmost respect for Ms. Lauder, but after having read this book, I do believe that she loves herself more than the rest of the world. (And I thought Madonna was narcissistic.) Estee even rationalizes why her cosmetics are so expensive: To sell them at cheaper prices would make the customer lose confidence in her quality. Which means, her cosmetics could be sold more cheaply than they are, but Estee would not want the customer to suspect low quality. (How thoughtful of you, Ms. Lauder, to consider the customer's feelings, rather than her pocketbook.)I have used Lauder products on occasion, but I definitely view the company in a different light after having read this book. Contrary to her belief, Lauder does not make the finest cosmetics in the world. Yes, the quality is high (at least for some of the products), but there are many products in existence that are of equal (and in many cases, higher) quality.Likewise, I take issue with her claim that her employees are the most knowledgable and best-trained in the field. Perhaps when she held the reins of the company--and when the book was written (1985)--that was the case. But I have visited Lauder counters on more than one occasion--and have found that often, I know more about the product than the salesperson does. Apparently, training of Lauder salespeople is not exactly at the standards it once was.Bottom line: This book makes for a fascinating read, but keep an antacid nearby. Your stomach will need it."},{"Title":"Estee: A Success Story","review":"Based on the information the previous reviewer wrote, I am wondering if this is the same book as the one previously written by Mrs. Lauder, called \\"A Success Story\\".

Every other page, Estee is talking about her precious oriental rugs, vases, her ability to decorate, to know exactly what to say, which ingredients to include in a formula, etc. The last third of the book is nothing more than her bragging about the many homes she owns all over the world, all of the wonderful views, and what a wonderful \\"good life\\" she is living. She has the audacity to talk about the proper way to give parties (making sure you have beautiful women to seat your guests), how she bought up every pink (out-of-season flower in Paris) to make sure she had just the right shade of pink for launching Beautiful, having napkins dyed just the right shade of color, per Pablo Picasso's paintings--for a museum party. All the \\"little\\" things are so important, you know....I do have utmost respect for Ms. Lauder, but after having read this book, I do believe that she loves herself more than the rest of the world. (And I thought Madonna was narcissistic.) Estee even rationalizes why her cosmetics are so expensive: To sell them at cheaper prices would make the customer lose confidence in her quality. Which means, her cosmetics could be sold more cheaply than they are, but Estee would not want the customer to suspect low quality. (How thoughtful of you, Ms. Lauder, to consider the customer's feelings, rather than her pocketbook.)I have used Lauder products on occasion, but I definitely view the company in a different light after having read this book. Contrary to her belief, Lauder does not make the finest cosmetics in the world. Yes, the quality is high (at least for some of the products), but there are many products in existence that are of equal (and in many cases, higher) quality.Likewise, I take issue with her claim that her employees are the most knowledgable and best-trained in the field. Perhaps when she held the reins of the company--and when the book was written (1985)--that was the case. But I have visited Lauder counters on more than one occasion--and have found that often, I know more about the product than the salesperson does. Apparently, training of Lauder salespeople is not exactly at the standards it once was.Bottom line: This book makes for a fascinating read, but keep an antacid nearby. Your stomach will need it."},{"Title":"Estee: A Success Story","review":"Estee wasgood at cosmetics. She was not a good writer.

Guess it may be of interest to people with new babies."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"I guess they changed the title of this book at some point -- the copy I got from the library was called \\"Loaded, A Misadventure In the Marijuana Trade\\". At any rate, forget any tepid reviews by \\"professional\\" reviewers who somehow feel this story wasn't quite up to their literary standards. The book is just a flat out great read and had me laughing out loud many times. A hilarious but cautionary tale with a serious ending, the adventures of pot smuggler Allen Long are so far out there that you know they must be true. Any baby boomer who did time in the counter culture of the 60s and 70s, or who is familiar with the drug culture of that era will get a big kick out of this book, and I'd think many younger readers would enjoy it as well.Allen Long was a man of immense ability, ambition and personal charm, as well as a natural leader... who also loved to smoke the best pot he could find. He probably would have been successful in any field but some people need to take the road less travelled. Long was the man responsible for Columbian marijuana coming to the US (millions of tons of it). I got the impression that he was as much a crusader for marijuana as he was in it for the money, at least in the beginning. The first part of the book is almost like a Cheech & Chong screenplay, with multi-million dollar deals and hair-raising scenarios being improvised by people who stay as stoned-out as possible at all times; but by the end the gangsters have moved in, the trade has turned to cocaine, and the intial hippie-capitalist spirit has vanished, to be replaced with cutthroat competition, greed and violence. Long never has the heart to become a gangster and is eventually squeezed out of the business by the more ruthless and hungry Latin Americans. It's a look at a particular part of era that hasn't often been told, and certainly never told in such a thoroughly entertaining manner. Thumbs up all the way."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"I know Allen Long and think that he must be one of the most adventurous men I've ever met. This book is his tale of his younger years, running the gambit on the Mary Jane trail; taking the risks and living the life that goes with it. What makes this book so awesome, is that Allen actually did live this book! This isn't a story to be told to wow anyone; Allen is a wealthy man today and doesn't need to impress anyone. This is just a good book about something that we all would have probably loved to try back in our younger years if we just had the balls...Allen has those balls you wished you had. A must read if you want to re-live some fantasy's and live vicariously through Allen Long!"},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"This book reads like a novel, only better.

I liked it."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"The author Robert Sabbag has this scene nailed down. I thought I had read, or maybe even lived it all. No sir. This book \\"jacks it up\\" to new levels of adreneline pumping. These characters had balls. Big ones. And it is really fun to read about people like that.The opening, where a DC-3 is barely making it to the Columbian border at sunrise after a few days of flight is second to none. One of the best and tightest openings to any book I have ever read. Where is the movie???Thank you, Mr. Sabbag"},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"Following the modern day swashbuckler, Allen Long, on his adventurous trips in the smuggling business gives the reader a lesson in how North America's appetite for marijuana was fed for the decade after the 60's.The author Sabbag concentrates on the fast-paced smuggling business, denying the reader insight into the characters risking life and limb to become the Kings of Pot. As a result, the whole book is a sustained flurry of activity. This isn't a bad thing, as the lack of character development creates the atmosphere I imagine the protagonist Long lived in - one of many contacts, and never being sure who they really are and who is going to play an important part later on in the story.I walked away from this book with the distinct impression that smugglers, perhaps more than anything else, are adrenaline junkies. Stepping up drug interdiction efforts is to people like Long what one more school bus was to Evil Knievel; the bigger the risk, the bigger the rush.I'm not giving anything away when I say the book ends with the quote \\"this would make a great movie.\\" Perhaps that is why over half of Americans still support this War on Drugs - it's so entertaining."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"I couldn't stop reading once I started.

The author does a great job of putting you back into the early days of the drug trade. It is one of the better books I have read recently. This guy did a lot but his world wasn't quite as ruthless as the top level Pablo Escobar types."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but that doesn't mean everyone has to like other people's opinions everytime. Robert Sabbag is Hot Property and by far one of the best journalist type writer working these days. His account of the \\"Mari-Jane\\" Trade is nothing short of spectacular. As much as certain segments of the population might want to criticize all things involving drugs, it is still quite obvious that these stories are highly (and I stress \\"highly\\") connected with american culture and also the world. This book is fun to read and captures a period of time where the individuals of this great country attempted and many more times than not, succeeded, in transporting large quantities of \\"Weed\\" via sea or air and then selling most of it at a large profit. The curse, of course, is that harder drugs were widely accepted later and consumed by societies around the world and of course, what at first began as a free enterprise later got ugly and I am not getting into it. For the earlier years of the smuggling \\"craze\\" Smokescreen does a fine job and Robert Sabbag either by first hand or second hand knowledge captures an entire period with a specially acute sense of humor. For that I give it a 5 star rating, anything less would be \\"uncivilized\\"."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"This was by far the best book I have ever read.

The author has a delightful way of describing the characters the smuggler meets along the way, making this book a real page-turner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"The book was good. Just loved reading about the early days of the weed smugglers. Though quite different than todays smugglers, that time period held some basic business standards that included less violence, and more trust. The writing style of his book was somewhat hard to follow and his use of words that were not necessary was sometimes challenging to read. Overall, the story was great and it would make a great movie.

Sabbag goes back to the halycon days of the early 70's, and recreates drug smuggling with the most erudite of novelistic verve! That's a feat- this is 30 years later we're covering, and to place us, the bored and incompetent reader, back in that perfervid time is a feat of highwire journalistic daring. Like \\"Blow,\\" that good movie and even better book, this is a hale and debonair look at that most Aemrican of enterprises, the upright white guy's ascent into and then descent out of the murky, sinister, yet grievously partying world of international big-stakes durg smuggling. Sabbag is clear that Long is our protagonist, our stand-in for all the pusillanimous white boy dreamers who toked but never sold, and his style is pure Boy's Life, rippling adventure and shifting fortunes interspersed like a Hollywood thriller. Corporate America, that global behemoth, is a study in amoral, unethical gamesplaying, so spare the world any qualms about the ultimate worth of this bad boy's bucaneering. The drugs many imbibe in this country are a mark of our depravity, yet also a condemnation of our listless and purposeless social inertia. Sabbag's book will fail to register a single sine wave as social commentary, since it is too kinetic and jargon-free to qualify as stolid academic commentary, but this is our ultimate failing as a society. This book is directly connected to our vital communal adrenaline, and stands as a wholly pleasurable celebration of human initiative, and then earned senescence (Long is an unjailed, unmarked family man at the end, unlike the haunted hipster of \\"Blow\\"). Whatever your moral positioning, this is a male beach read for the ages."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"I owned this book for a year and tried to read it twice to no avail. Sabbag is a good writer but the book just jumps around way to much and is just BORING in spots. I have read quite a few books on the subject and the story of this is just way out there. I don't care how \\"charming\\" Long was. The story is just to much to believe. Personally I liked \\"Weed Man\\" and \\"Contrabando\\" much more."},{"Title":"Smokescreen UK Edition","review":"Anyone like me who was suggested this book by Amazon after purchasing Howard Mark's Mr. Nice should not make the mistake and buy this book. This overly wordy, poorly structured book had me aching at most points throughout the story. Robert Sabbag must have opened up a thesaurus and decided to use every adjective possible. He \\"describes\\" the endless forests of the Columbian jungles in a ho-hum manner than incited no such sort of wonder.Long stretches of the book drag on where Sabbag takes, most likely an extremely exciting life, and turns it in to a repetitive, nonchalant, bore. It seems like every scene where cannabis is involved, someone comments on how it is the best marijuana they've ever smoked, and it's left at that. The book jumps all over the place leaving the reader confused, annoyed, and having to re-read passages because of them being so poorly structured.Read this book if you have the comprehension levels of a 14 year old. I honestly feel like this book was written towards young people because any person having respect for drugs place in society will just find this book silly."},{"Title":"Must we mean what we say?: A book of essays","review":"I've never met Professor Stanley Cavell, and though I've emailed him he has obviously been too busy to respond. Nevertheless, in my view, his books will be read long after many philosophers of the twentieth century are buried and forgotten. The reason can be summed up in a single word: insight. Rarely has there been a more perspicuous observer of motion pictures than Professor Cavell. To read his commentary on movies is to enhance one's movie-viewing experience. He sees things that no one else sees, he sees relations that are missed by others. My enjoyment of films has been substantially augmented by my reading of Professor Cavell's essays. He has opened a new dimension for me. I am less impressed by his infatuation with performatives in his book &quot;Must We Mean What We Say?&quot; but, to the extent that performatives opened for him a door to performances, it was an intellectual journey well worth undertaking.

Given internal religious strife in Europe, and England was in no exception mood, these were pretty much dangerous times and many heads rolled and were to roll, More&quot;s included, due to the persecution by Henry VIII. Whatever was to be said about the nettlesome religious matter had to be done with extrema caution in order to avoid the perilous verdicts of the Holy Tribunal.Along with Thomas More, Desiderius Erasmus was one of the most important representatives of the Renaissance literary movement in northern Europe and what was casually presented by Erasmus as a booklet inspired by a casual play of words with the surname More (which is almost equal to Moriae, madness in Greek), was in fact an attempt to salvage what should be rescued of the Classical Greek Antiquity in Erasmus' opinionated argument and incorporated in the Christian thought of the time. Beneath an almost non-descript faade was an issue of utmost significance to the evolution of the so-called Natural Sciences, that were to benefit from advances of recent discoveries in Physics, Chemistry and later on Biology, but which were hindered to evolve by the so-called aristotelian taint inherited by the Scholastic medieveal tradition so dear to the traditionalist Catholic Church, a task difficult in itself but which Erasmus easily outdone with a satyrical style that offended no one, preserving all the respect to the Church hierarchy and its dogmas and, most importantly, the figure of Jesus Christ.The book is in fact a small one but the reader is much rewarded by the richness of its content, where the author takes him by his hands and strolls with him trough ancient Greek and Roman mithology in a verbose prose at the same time easy, vigorous and stimulating, where one is impressed by the author's astounding erudiction, as if he was a northern true inheritor of the Tuscan Dante Aligheri (the Divine Comedy) in this purpose. This is certainly one of the best literary works of late Renaissance and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"In Praise of Folly","review":"This is the worst translation into English from any language I have ever read.

Erasmus was a brilliant writer, who mocks about everybody in this book, but subtle. He wrote it in honour of Thomas More, he was also a friend of Martin Luther, but remained Roman Catholic. He also founded the 'Collegium Trilingue' where they tought Greek, Roman and Hebrew, in Louvain, Flanders."},{"Title":"In Praise of Folly","review":"Classic literature, kinda not as interesting to read as I as expecting.

The book itself isn't very long, but for me it was really hard to focus on the text and completely comprehend what I was reading-- so it wasn't a quick read for me. When I was able to focus hard enough on what I was reading to understand it, it proved to provide some humor though. So it is my personal opinion that this is an enjoyable book so long as you are more intelligent and have a longer attention span than I, as the average college student, do."},{"Title":"In Praise of Folly","review":"Desiderius Erasmus was surely the most logical and objective viewer of Europe's plight in the early 16th century.

To see something that I had consciously &quot;studied&quot; for so long misrepresented,while having been passionately involved with it pained me then(and still does now.)In advertisements for the book,it stated the author's involvement with Shovelheads goes back to 1969.If that's true,he should've payed more attention to what was going on.By the way,I hear the author now rides a Buell..."},{"Title":"Harley-Davidson Shovelhead (Motorcycle Color History)","review":"As Chapter Historian and (in detail) H-D enthousiast for over 30 years I collected a nice arsenal of Harley documentation, among them many genuine model brochures. These brochures helped me a great deal in setting up a complete Harley model and history timeline, starting with the 1966 Shovelhead model, the 2nd year legendary Electra Glide.I purchased this specific Shovelhead book at Harley-Davidson dealership Wars in London several years ago and looked into it far more than once. I think this book is very usefull giving an overview of the Shovelhead period. In this book many nice pictures of (almost) stock bikes and it even states the bikes are pictured from a riders point of view. So thinking back many years and Harley being a motorcycle that is invented for putting on and off stuff it's really hard to find a completely stock bike. I guess they will be in the Milwaukee H-D archives only.Reading model history books it's hard to find one where no mistake at all is to be found. Also this one has some, but not annoying and for the not so indepth reader almost unnoticable. Looking at the specific boattail rear fender of the 1971 FX Super Glide for example, this indeed was a one year only design. Looking at the genuine 1972 model brochure of the FX Super Glide, the rear fender was already changed by a more common style, including the seat. So, one must ask questions looking at a FX boattail model having a sign in front of it telling us it's 1972 modelyear. I do not think so.Looking at specific modelyears it is a good idea to compare the fueltank graphics. This normally changes every modelyear and therefore is good reference for a specific model. HD brochures inwhich the original pictures are shown should be the reference here. Doing all that it's more than often a hell of a job getting all specs right. In some original (mid) 70s brochures there even is no modelyear stated! So no bad credits for the author in this point.So all put together this is a nice book which tells you a lot. Not all, but a lot. Books which cover the big or complete picture of a certain HD period of time are not written yet. The clue is to read many more and combine the history stories on your own. There are several authors out there, so a good job for us to do so.Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"Although my mother has some serious health problems, she's still in her fifties, so I hesitated at first to read this book. I thought there was no way it could be relevant to adults whose parents are ill but not elderly. I was wrong. This book was a godsend as my siblings and I scrambled around trying to figure out what we needed to do and how we could do it. I've referred to it again and again, not just for practical help with my mom's needs, but emotional support for myself. What a tremendous resource this book is."},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"This book is a must for anyone dealing with the monumental problems that can arise as parents get older.

For oneself and as a gift to others, this is a jewel."},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"Claire Berman gives fabulous examples for all types of caregiver situations. The information is a valuable tool in handling a wide range of issues, from a parent's early needs, to full nursing care. The book aids caregivers with making medical and financial decisions for elderly parents and finding help in the community without jeopardizing your loved one's independence. In addition, it encourages the reader to find the right caregiver support group and keep a clear focus on your own family needs/priorities."},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"Claire Berman's book speaks to my heart. As the child of an aging parent, I have come to realize that the difficulties I face as a caregiver are at least as much, if not more, emotional than physical. Her stories, whether directly related to my circumstances or not, address my raw emotions and help ease the pain.Her personal style of writing is unusually apt for those who are a parent's caregiver. She addresses care for aging parents from the perspective of a person who has made her own mistakes and learned from them. She writes as a friend rather than an impersonal \\"expert.\\" I recommend this book for anyone who faces this demanding task.Phyllis Staff, Ph.D.author, \\"How to Find Great Senior Housing\\"and\\"128 Ways to Prevent Alzheimer's and Other Dementias\\""},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"This book would be very good for someone with a parent just starting into the elder care system. If your parent is already in the system and you are feeling very frustrated, guilty or generally upset with the situation it is not much help. I thought it would focus more on the \\"Yourself\\" and less on the parents. The focus was the parents."},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents, Third Edition: How to Help, How to Survive is a super resource that covrs so many aspects of the aging process of one's parents.

Both these people are close friends of the family. All her immediate family has done the convenient disappearing act. The Amazon website allowed me to view the table of contents and a few pages. No, I have not read the book. Yes, over the telephone, my friend has said it was helpful in dealing with her situation. There are a lot of used copies in the market, which to be honest was one of my selection criterion. The book covered many facets of self care and of matters dealing with the senior. Even the Lord rested on the seventh day :-)"},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"A most helpful book for reminding yourself how much your elderly parents would not want to be a burden to you, if they were still in their right minds. Lots of advice to make caregiving easier, well written, easy to read. Another great book is &quot;Elder Rage&quot; , which solves the nightmare dealing with difficult elders."},{"Title":"Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents","review":"A must read for the young generation, too bad it was not available when my parents were old. My daughter has raised some poignant ideas and questions , since she read this book. Give it to your children, they will appreciated later in your life."},{"Title":"Beyond Juggling: Rebalancing Your Busy Life","review":"Beyond Juggling was useful to me, a mother of young children, planning to reenter the workforce. I knew I didn't want the long hours and constant intensity of my previous job, but nor did I want a boring, low-stress, low-expectation job. The authors lay out the pros and cons of five strategies to keep your work and life in balance. I learned that I shouldn't work at home (what the authors call techflexing) since I need--and enjoy--the motivation of interacting with coworkers. On the other hand, my preference to concentrate on one thing at a time makes me good at alternating, a strategy of &quot;intense work periods followed by breaks to recharge.&quot; The authors' suggestion that alternaters choose occupations that have natural peaks and valleys, such as tax accounting helped me focus my job search.In addition to helping readers recognize and use balancing strategies that fit their personalities, Beyond Juggling shows how to incorporate other balancing strategies on a smaller scale. My need for spontaneity makes bundling, &quot;packing multiple purposes into a single event or activity,&quot; a poor choice for me generally, but forming an investment club may be the perfect way for me to stay in touch with both my friends and my portfolio once I go back to work.Since I love to give advice, I relished the appendix, &quot;How Managers Can Use This Book,&quot; a whole arsenal of tools to get the best from your employees, not just the most. A wise manager may just give this book to his team members, and prevent burnout before it happens."},{"Title":"Beyond Juggling: Rebalancing Your Busy Life","review":"There are lots of books out there just waiting to organize your life and tell you what to do. Problem is, once you finish reading the book, it's impossible to put everything into practice. I really enjoyed Beyond Juggling because it went past that. It gave real, workable solutions to fit work and personal life. I work at a Fortune 500 company and find it difficult in the early part of my career to take the advice of most books. I can't &quot;get off the treadmill&quot; or work flextime until I've build up some organizational credibility. The great thing about the book was that I found solutions that worked for me. It wasn't preachy by telling me I should, of course, put family first. I know that already. Rather they listed great strategies that have really helped me to help balance everything that's important to me.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves work, and loves their life, but doesn't necessarily want the two to be one and the same!"},{"Title":"Beyond Juggling: Rebalancing Your Busy Life","review":"I highly recommend this book! It's invaluable for all of us committed to meaningful work, friends and family, life, spirit, and self--and who don't want to give up any of them.

The authors have interviewed hundreds of professionals over the years and received an inside look at how they have achieved work-life balance, and this book summarizes the findings for the rest of us."},{"Title":"Beyond Juggling: Rebalancing Your Busy Life","review":"If you've got too many demands and not enough time, this book will help you conquor the chaos - it's the next best thing to having Mary Poppins move in.

Each one of these alternatives is examined in detail with a description of what it is and is not, an aptitude test to determine if it is an appropriate option for you, and descriptions of the trade-offs for each option.The last part of the book contains a self-assessment that helps you determine the strategy that you are currently using, the ones that best fit your personal style, what will work now with your present career and life-stage and what will be needed in your future as your needs and circumstances change.This is simply the best book on balancing your life obligations that I have read to date. Immediately useful, highly practical, it is a highly recommended read for anyone seeking balance in life."},{"Title":"Beyond Juggling: Rebalancing Your Busy Life","review":"These authors have got it right. For over 30 years I lived in a very hectic world trying to balance family, work, hobbies, friends... In a large energy utility I was a mentor and coach to many, and now teach in a business school- and act as a consultant to industry. I continue to be in touch with a great number of folks of all ages. While the advice, and reflections of the working world I have given in the past seemed sound, and were generally consistent with many of the principles outlined in this book, those I coached, and I would be better off if I had the book then... but it is never too late- several of them will be receiving a Christmas gift early... Thank you Kurt et al."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"PBS' Napa Valley chef emphasizes a well-stocked pantry and fine presentation in addition to fresh, quality ingredients in this oversized, lavishly illustrated collection of California wine country Italian dishes. From Basil Chive Butter, Toasted Spice rub and Herb Oil (pantry items) to Salsa di Parmigiano and Marinated Salmon with Fennel Salad (antipasto) to Summer Corn Soup and Autumn Panzanella, Chiarello will have you willing to skip the entr&eacute;e altogether. Until you get to one of his simple and satisfying pasta dishes - with Walnut and Ricotta Pesto perhaps or Salsa Rosa (roasted pepper and tomato) from the pantry. And then there's Tuscan Shrimp with White Beans, Baby Back Ribs with Espresso BBQ Sauce or Quail with Bacon and Honey. His way with vegetables offers simple variety - Saut&eacute;ed Greens with Vinegar, Skillet-Fried Corn and Tomatoes, and a baked Cauliflower Alla Parmagiana that has become a staple in my house - whatever the vegetable. There are desserts too, mostly fruit with a few comfort items like Caramel Panna Cotta and an easy tiramisu, but the real pleasure comes from the savory. Leaf through the gorgeous pictures, and choose a dish - chances are you can have it on the table in half an hour - if you stock that pantry (there's even a recipe for fresh ricotta that's a must-try). Notes offer tips on technique and variations."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"I've grown to love Michael Chiarello's recipes. In the Goldilocks challenge between making a dish \\"too simple\\" or \\"too much work,\\" time after time Chiarello manages to find the spot that's exactly right. His recipes don't promise instant gratification, in the semi-homemade 30-minute style that's become popular recently. But he's also aware that you have something else to do with your day besides cooking dinner.Chiarello's background is Italian, so a lot of recipes in this book display that influence -- quite a bit of pasta, for example, and a tendency to use olive oil where others might choose butter. But you'd do better to think of it as Napa-meets-Italian, as his recipes aren't the sort of food that you'll find at the traditional restaurant with a red-checked tablecloth and a candle stuck in a bottle of Chianti. The book lives up to its promise of \\"casual cooking.\\"Chiarello encourages you to create a pantry of ingredients that you can call upon whenever needed, and I completely agree with that \\"good cooking in not much time\\" philosophy. At first, it might sound as though you need to cook three things just to have the ingredients for a single dish, but the pantry section helps you create items that, later, you'll be able to grab out of the freezer or your spice shelf and put into an \\"instant\\" meal. For example, we first made his awesome winter panzanella, which uses homemade croutons in addition to butternut squash and brussels sprouts. The croutons are easy enough -- assuming that you already made his bagna cauda butter. (It's basically anchovies, parsley, and garlic mixed with two sticks of softened butter.) But two days after the salad, we made clams and linguine with more of the bagna cauda butter, and *that* came together in less time than it took to boil the noodles. I still have a half cup of the bagna cauda butter in the freezer, just waiting for a day when I feel like more than a slab-of-steak.The pantry chapter is 30 pages long (including lots of beautiful photos; this is a great eye-candy cookbook), which includes everything from spiced walnuts to a fennel spice mix. The other chapters are appetizers; eggs & sandwiches; soups & salads; pasta; rice, beans & polenta; fish & shellfish; meat & poultry; vegetables; and sweet things. If you want a collection of fine Italian baking, you'll have to buy another book in addition to this one (you notice I'm assuming you'll buy this in any case), as his dessert choices are on the no-big-deal side of Thursday dinner rather than a big blowout feast. Panna cotta, perhaps, or dried fruit compote with Sambuca.Many of the recipes are extremely simple, in that \\"perfect roast chicken\\" way (his uses rosemary and lemon -- and it came out great) but he isn't afraid to provide a recipes for a sauce that needs to cook for hours. He usually includes menu advice (i.e. serve this with roast pork), and some kind of cook's notes, such as the tip that soaking red onion briefly in sherry vinegar will mellow the raw onion taste.A fine cookbook. Recommended."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"I bought this book because of the lemon rosemary chicken I saw Michael prepare on the Food Network. I made it myself and it was just as good as I imagined. The recipes are easy to prepare and every one that I have tried, I have loved."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"We are serious foodies and particularly love all regional Italian cooking. Admit we are bit skeptical of Italian American recipes but after watching MC on TV (finally got a Food Channel on satellite here in Australia) decided to invest in the book. It is brilliant - every recipes tried has scored a \\"do again\\" and the pantry items are great. Even a beginner can follow the recipes and experienced cooks will appreciate the layers of flavour that MC is always talking about. Buy this book - you won't be sorry! Off to buy his latest now...."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"First off, I love watching Mr. Chiarello on his show, Napa Style. I was a little intimidated to try some of his dishes. I went ahead and bought the cookbook. It can be intimidating at first because he basically tells it like it is. Be prepared to shop extensively for his pantry items. I don't know that I'll ever have all of these in my kitchen and I am fairly well stocked. I did make some substitutions so shoot me! Once you get over the shopping, the recipes are wonderful. They are quite simple and easy to follow as opposed to some celebrity chefs' cookbooks. Even if you don't cook anything from this book, you'll learn something about cooking and food quality just from reading. I did like the information he gave on buying \\"real\\" cheeses and such as opposed to the reduced-fat or fat-free varieties. He said the real stuff has more flavor and you can use less of it. He called fat-free cooking inferior. I did find that by mostly sticking to the recipe (couldn't find everything specified) I was able to eat less because the flavor was quite satisfying."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"Michael Chiarello's Napa Style cooking show is one of my top rated cooking shows, and when I discovered his new, you too can cook his down to earth recipes, I just had to have this cookbook. The cook book is very self explanatary, the recipes succinct and the pictures make it all seem so easy. Michael's Napa Style is extremely refreshing in today's lifestyle."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"Nice book, beautiful pictures. I enjoyed the hints Michael includes with the recipes and text. This is an extension of what you get from his TV programs."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"One killer recipe after another in this book. Outstanding suggestions and photos, remarkable results. Not always very simple cooking, but simple directions made easy to understand. Wine recommendations come with recipe selections too, very complete and tasty!"},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"The pictures in this book are so beautiful they are almost satisfying all by themselves, but of course, we want to taste too--and we can. I love that this book starts with Michael describing store bought kitchen staples that really make a difference in how a dish turns out. I fully understand that you can carefully follow a delicious sounding recipe and then be disappointed with the results. He says this sometimes happens because the ingredients used aren't the same as those used by the chef. We can use fresh, in season and flavorful raw ingredients, but vinegars, oils, spices and other packaged products can vary significantly and affect the outcome. I completely agree and have my preferences just as he does, but I also learned some things from his discussion, like that dried beans can get old just like fresh beans and then not rehydrate properly. Since I've had that happen, I am now more willing to use dried beans again and will just be sure I purchase them from a place where the stock turns over often so the beans are no more than a year old.I also love the next section on home preparation of certain basics such as chicken stock and herb or spice combinations. Here again I have my personal favorites but am tempted to make the herbed butters and sauces he describes to add to my repertoire. One thing I learned was that while I always keep a spray bottle of ascorbic acid (vitamin C powder from the health food store) mixed with water in the fridge to spray on cut sections of apple to maintain their color, it hadn't dawned on me to do the same with my basil pesto to keep it a vibrant green.I'm looking forward to making my own ricotta as it sounds easy and I've never found a store bought brand I liked. The Salsa Genovese is divine and since it has multiple varied uses I can use up the whole recipe (yield 1 cup) in a few days of entirely different meals.This is a coffee table book, but also really useful. It raises simple foods to new heights and makes you want to linger over preparation instead of rush, like I usually do. I don't always have the time to devote, but when I do, preparing some of these recipes feels like taking a warm bath--relaxing and uplifting.Many of the recipes include special 'Michael's Notes' at the bottom, which I've really learned from. I love the smell of fennel but it always seemed too hard to chew when in a salad. It never crossed my mind to use my beloved adjustable V-slicer to slice it paper thin. I guess all cooks get into some ruts and forget to seek other solutions sometimes. I sure do. These tips have helped me see things a different way.Michael's notes also include ideas for using up some leftover sauce or breadcrumbs prepared for a particular dish. This alone is worth the cost of the book for me because now those extras that might have been thrown out spur creation of another interesting dish I might not otherwise have thought of.All in all, I love this book. The recipes are clearly described, easy to follow and not too labor intensive. Most are different from those commonly found elsewhere or at least have a different twist and even though most are fairly simple there is a languid quality about their preparation that makes them feel special. The \`Chicken with Rosemary and Lemon Oil' is utterly straightforward, yet wonderful, and tips are given for both the preferred convection roasting technique and for regular oven roasting.This book is just as delicious to read as to cook from. You don't have to love Italian food to love the way it's presented here. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking","review":"My husband is the cook in our household and this book is his #1 favorite.

From the way he speaks and acts, to the way he treats other people, he personifies all the worst of the narcissistic, self absorbed, phony consumers this country has to offer. In Chef Mike's warped egaliterian mind, I am sure he doesn't even notice the contradiciton when he pays lip service to the poor and hungry, and then uses $180 bottle of wine from his vineyard to soak his free range chicken breasts in to make the oh-so-tender for his stylish Califonia friends that wouldnt let a poor peron within 1000 yards from his gated community. To the way he berated the poor young chef-to-be on Top Chef for the poor kids inability to say the name Chiarello correctly. That's right, the guy did not say Chiarello \\"Italian\\" enough for Chef Mike, so the chef excluded him. I am all for a mentor being a harda$$ and rough taskmasters, but there should be an underlying method to teach and impart something more important than oneself. Case in point, Gordon Ramsay extremely vicious, but he does it to impress excellence, and he is just ask quick to compliment. I could never imagine Chef Ramsay being so egotistical as to exclude someone for pronouncing his name incorrectly? But them again, Chef Ramsay is a self made man, not a self absorbed smuck. Chef Mike dressed this young kid down on national TV for no other reason than he could. Chef Mike then proceeded to smoke his dish in vines he had flown in from his vineyard specifically for the occasion...and he lost? It just goes to show you that money doesn't make a great chef, but it does-at times, make a person great and wonderful in his own mind.I wouldn't buy a book from this earthworm if it were 3 cents."},{"Title":"Remember me to Tom","review":"Having read a good biography of Tennessee Williams as well as his perfectly useless autobiography -and as one who loves his major plays - I really wanted to get my hands on his mother's story.

There are times when I didn't want to keep reading because it was hard having &#34;that woman&#34;in my head - her voice is that clear as she writes - but ultimately the book made a whole lot of sensein the context of Williams' life.

These men took over the towns of Alder Creek, Virginia City and Bannock and ran them as criminal enterprises. Eventually groups of ordinary citizens formed secret vigilante organizations to combat the road agents. Taking the law into their own hands they pursued, shot or hanged as many of the road agents as possible. On Virginia City's Boot Hill there are presently gravemarkers with the names of a number of the men mentioned in the book who were captured and hanged by the vigilantes. Dimsdale, the author, was born in England and took over editorship of the Virginia City paper. Some of the events he witnessed, but more he relates from the testimony of those who participated in them. The accounts are a bit confusing -- they read as newspaper reports and lack a historian's distance and clarity. But they make up for all faults in the immediacy of their telling. This is a very valuable document of life in the old west, and gives an extraordinary sense of what life was like in a raw mining town, too new to have any legitimate law enforcement. Mark Twain cites Dimsdale and quotes him copiously in &quot;Roughing It,&quot; his account of his adventures in Carson City, Nevada, and other places in the West."},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","review":"Dimsdale writes of Montana history in a clarity not often appreciated by some history authors. &quot;The Vigilantes of Montana&quot; brings, page after page, the gold-rush era of Montana Territory to the memory and eyes of the reader. This fascinating text tells the story as my ancestors told of living in Montana during this period. It is an excellent choice for any reader interested in a true account of the romantic and hostile West."},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","review":"After gold was discovered in the Bitter Root Mountains of present-day Montana in 1860, lawlessness followed the rush of miners into the region. Bannock and Virginia City became important centers within the mining districts, and by 1862 were typical western \\"shoot-em-up\\" towns teaming with unsavory characters, racked by violence, and basically \\"removed from the restraints of civilized society\\" and its laws. It's in that context that the Montana Vigilantes were created, a group that, according to the author, brought order out of chaos by offering \\"a shield of protection\\" to the citizens while wielding \\"a sword of retribution\\" against lawless marauders. An interesting development occurred in Bannock, however, in that the elected sheriff (Henry Plummer) apparently at the same time was the leader of the most notorious road gang (thieves and murderers) in the territory. Thomas Dimsdale, an Englishman who had gone to Viginia City in 1863 for his health and who shortly after operated the first newspaper published in Montana, wrote a series of articles for his paper about Plummer, his operations and agents, and the work of the vigilantes to bring to justice (often by hanging) these criminals, and these articles were later collected to make this book.In 1987, a new biography of Plummer by R.E. Mather and F.E. Boswell threw Dimsdale's book into the realm of controversy by declaring a belief that Plummer was innocent of the crimes Dimsdale accused him of and that Dimsdale praised the work of the vigilantes too highly and uncritically. There is no doubt that Plummer had a criminal past before coming to Bannock (he was hanged there by the vigilantes in 1864), having served time in San Quentin for murder. Who is closer to presenting the truer picture is hard to say, but Dimsdale's work is a thrilling and dramatic account, a fascinating narrative that is as lively as a Max Brand western story."},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","review":"This was first given to me 1976. What I would do with this one, I don't care about vigilantes, I have no interest in Montana, and time is too precious to take it away from the 19th century, my favorite. It suddenly dawned upon me, this is the 19th century, and if someone is going to understand the mindset of the century, you will have to examine the mindset of the whole population. Reluctantly I picked the book up and began reading. Some hours later I set the book down sorry that the author had run out of words.Thomas J. Dimsdale was an Englishman who settled in 1863 and Virginia City, Montana and in 1864 took over as editor of the Montana Post. The newspapers served as the first publisher in serial all of The Vigilantes of Montana and perhaps some of the writing in this book, some of the romantic element, some of the color of the book is explainable artifact it was first written for the newspaper. In this century that has arisen some question about the true facts surrounding the \\"villain\\" of the story. Henry Plummer arrived in the gold camp in Nevada City in 1852 and very soon participated in the wholesome disreputable houses when he saw fit to murder two men. By 1862 former was notorious as a boss of the gang of criminals. In 1863 moved to Montana and news was elected sheriff. This is the story of the vigilantes who tracked down, tried, and executed plumber and his gang of desperados. Some modern researchers who tried to prove Plummer innocent of the crimes for which he was executed.The author describes this event in colorful detail and very readable narrative as you see in this excerpt:\\"seeing that the circumstances were such as embedded of neither vacillation nor delay, the citizenry here, summoning his friends, when up to the party and gave the military command, \\"company! Forward march!\\" This was at once obeyed a rope taken from a noted functionary's bed and had been mislaid [more was immediately sent for and soon they were hundreds of feet of good hemp] ....\\"The order to \`Bring up Plummer' was then passed and repeated; but no one stirred. The leader went over to this \`perfect gentleman', as his friends called him, and was met by a request to \`Give a man time to pray.' Well knowing that Plummer relied on a rescue on other than Divine aid, he said briefly and decidedly, ' Certainly, but let him say his prayers up here.'\\"And, \\"Soon after, the party formed and returned to the town leaving the corpses stiffening in the icy blast. The bodies were eventually cut down by the friends of the road agents and varied. The \`Reign of Terror' in Bismarck was over.\\" The book continues for another hundred and eighteen pages of the same where only the names and places are changed to condemn to posterity the guilty. At the end, the author provides a section of short biographies of the leading players.This is an easy reading book, well worth what you might pay for it, and whether all of the factual information is an is factual is somewhat immaterial here because it does give a picture of these decades in the West India and Hollywood would be afraid to imagine."},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","review":"Although Dimsdale professes only an &quot;intimate acquaintance with parties cognizant of the facts related.&quot;, there far too many instances where he recalls minute particulars of an incident and/or corrects the contemporary accounts of the vigilantes' exploits.Another fact is, that his status as an &quot;educated Englishman&quot; would have made him an ideal candidatefor a group such as the vigilantes. He would have been an important asset in maintaining their credibility with the public.I'm a writer myself and know by the sheer quantity of minute details related, it could only have come from witnessing, and not merely from transcribing.I guess you could get away with that in the early 1860s'.This is a first-person account! And, a great book!Earl Swinhart"},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","review":"It's a good book. It is written by a man who was actually there for the events.(Well, in the area) It is an interesting event in history. My only complaint is the way it's written. Understand, this man was not an \\"author\\" by present standards. He's a mountain doctor that wrote down the events. The book is good, but the way it's written you kinda feel like your reading the same story over and over. Here's the bad guys, they go get them, they hang them. There is no flow of events. It's more like a bunch of short stories than a book that flows over the entire event. There is another book on the subject and will probably try to read that one. It is a good book and worth the read. But I would say you may want to try a different book on this event written by a more skilled author. I'm not disappointed really, just kinda seemed like I was reading the same chapter over and over, just with different names and places."},{"Title":"The vigilantes of Montana (March of America facsimile series)","review":"I've read this book several times. I've been in all these towns several times also and the Bannack ghost town is especially interesting and very, veryeerie.

It may be written for children, but it really brightened the day for a few stressed Ivy Leaguers! As always, giggle-inducing illustrations, and a fun (painless!) introduction to poetry for young readers. Buy it for yourself, for your 8 year old, or for your college student."},{"Title":"Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook","review":"Runny Babbit, a book authored an illustrated by Shel Silverstein (Oscar nominee, Grammy winner, bestselling poet/artist), is one with an unusual premise. It tells of the adventures (and a few misadventures) of our hero in his native, Green Woods, where the language is a bit...different. Take Runny Babbit, for instance. We all know that it's suppose to be Bunny Rabbit, but thats a bit cliche. So Runny Babbit, not to mention his friends, Ploppy Sig, Rirty Dat, Calley At, and so on are perfect for this book. Even normal words are toyed with, and I'll admit that this can be confusing, and sometimes a little frustrating. But I got used to it after about the tenth page and found that the rest of the book was pretty darn good.The poems are vintage Silverstein, in the manner of being silly, and are perfect for his final book. Runny Babbit is a fun book for all types of children, especially budding poets. I might even go so far to mention that it rivals Silversein's other classics (see, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, The Giving Tree, and others). Oh, and the illustrations are Shel Silverstein at his very best.R, reviewer from the 'hood."},{"Title":"Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook","review":"I have always been a fan of Mr. Silverstein but was pleasantly surprised what a fun little book this was to read.

You must read it out loud, even if you are by yourself, to get the full humor.

Especially Runny Babbit, where my 7 year old and I laughed ourselves silly over the poems and their delightful tales. Each of us had our favorites. Mine was Runny's Rittle Leminders with a wall full of notes reminding bunny to \\"Dettle sown\\", \\"Tick up your poys\\" or \\"Don't sight with your fister\\".As always, the drawings are wonderful and the tales are true to real life. But taking easy to follow verse and scrambling the words (wambling the scrords)in a spooneristic way makes this book extra fun to read.I loved how the same word was corrupted differently so chicken became chied fricken, picken charmesan or sicken choup and Runny Babbit was called a billy sabbit by his animal friends.As for the tongue twisting, by the time we'd read each poem several times, that wasn't a problem. This is a BIG favorite of ours.

Just to let you know all the pages are poems of how the rabbit lives.A reminder while you're reading this book, you might notice something funny, or I mean runny, about the words.

I had previously received several different shippings from Amazon.com at my current address in the Czech Republic. I think Amazon.com just stopped shipping overseas (too costly?) but didn't bother to inform us. Maybe the dollar rates falling, who knows the real reason.

After he died his family compiled the entire thing as a project of love.I highly recommend this read, my children love it and it is eduactional. Since it is all backwords, it forces children to think about every word and how it should be instead of how it is. It is fun to read as is and switch around and read as it should be.

(I found out later that it was finished after his death, so maybe that has something to do with it.) It would have been ok if one or two of the poems were written in this style (of transposing the letters as in the name of the book), but it's every single poem and it makes it hard to read and not funny or silly at all.

I made the mistake of suggesting he purchase the book that comes with the CD. THE CD IS AWFUL!!! The narrator sounds like he has a head cold and should have called in a sick day, but showed up at the studio anyway. There are only 12 poems on the CD, and it only runs about 10 minutes. (I know, that's like the joke about the restaurant that served lousy food, and such small servings!!! But it adds to the feeling of being completely ripped off by the CD.) It is not worth buying!!!

The characters are dear, and the poems are delightful and skillfully crafted. My husband and I read them to one another one Sunday morning when we were off work together and enjoyed every minute.I can see pre-readers enjoying the mystery in the entangled words and older readers enjoying the nonsense of the whole thing.

As with \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" and \\"Falling Up,\\" \\"Runny Babbit\\" was written by a man who was just a little kid at heart. I had trouble reading it out loud the first time but kids won't miss a beat. His books bring out the kid in all of us and are the most perfect gift for the young and young at heart. All Silverstein books are priced inexpensively to make them more accessible to kids, a huge plus since his books are keepers and givers.HarperCollins must be joking when they list this book for ages 9-12.

It really shakes up your reading to find that, \\"Wait a second! That's wot written the nay I thought I was reading it!\\" This is especially true considering Shel spent such a long time writing the book, finding the best way to construct each sentence, choosing the best words possible to play with in his little anthology-o-neologisms.Fortunately, and as always with Shel Silverstein however, the gimmick of playing with words as he did throughout is not the only seed of ingenuity that germinates in the book. The stories themselves are perfect allegories of our daily lives --falling in love, playing games, going to school, getting a haircut, having a baby-- all elements of an ordinary life told from a unique and fresh perspective.And as any Shel Silverstein fan knows, his is a unique ability to create something that can be enjoyed by both inquisitive children and scholars alike for it's clear to tell through his entire oeuvre that Shel was well aware that the two are truly the same."},{"Title":"Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook","review":"This crazy title gives some idea of what's going on between the covers of award-winning author/artist Shel Silverstein's bew nook, er, new book. You are now entering the backwards land of Toe Jurtle, Skertie Gunk, Rirty Dat and Dungry Hog, an imaginative series of adventures where all and sundry speak Runny Babbit talk.Each page has a new rhyme (rhew nyme?) and one of Silverstein's humorous and endearing black and white illustrations, lines guaranteed to keep your child guffawing with the silly sounds that come from saying things backwards:\\"When Ramma Mabbit started teachin'Runny how to eat,He ficked his pood up with his ears,He wasn't very neat.\\"There's the rhyme about \\"His Kajesty the Ming\\", \\"Runny the Fricken Charmer\\", \\"Runny's Garty Pames\\" and \\"Runny Shearns to Lare.\\"Runny discovers the library:\\"Runny lent to the wibraryAnd there were bundreds of hooks-Bistory hooks, beography gooks,And lots and lots of bory stooks.\\" (\\"Runny's Heading Rabits\\")A wild celebration of the antics of language run amok, Silverstein has created page after page of laughs for children to read, challenging their reading and comprehension skills, the reward an hour of giggles.

He's just the best there is, and there's no one in his category. Along with Shel's inimitable illustrations, the text keeps kids laughing by reversing the first sounds/letters of pairs of words, so the book offers a kind of interactive puzzle solving as the reader figures out the meaning of each pair, making the book lots of run to fead.So here's Shel's triple-whammy formula:1.

For people who can't read so well, you might need help with all the funky Babbit words Silverstein made up. But, they're not all made up. For example look at the title \\"Runny Babbit\\". If you put the \\"R\\" in Runny in the place the \\"B\\" is in Babbit and put the \\"B\\" where the \\"R\\" was you will have \\"Bunny Rabbit\\".

Definitally doesn't help with my kids who are learning how to spell larger words. It is great for the collection, but not that great for younger kids to read on their own.

Reading a book they enjoy will certainly help hold their interest and make them WANT to read. Books packed with funny poems are definitely a good method to try.

I ended up purchasing \\"A Light In The Attic\\" for him to read as well and, of course, \\"Runny Babbit.\\"You can expect the same Shel Silverstein humor & entertainment from \\"Runny Babbit,\\" but it's also a bit different as, just like the title, the poems contain words with 'backwards' letters & kids can't help but laugh at this (and they DO understand how the first letter of the words have been reversed).I definitely recommend this book to any child who enjoys reading, likes humor in poetry as well as children who need that extra \\"push\\" to get them interested in reading more.

I received it as a gift from my parents for two reasons:1 - Everyone in our family talks upside down and backwards, especially me. I can hardly spit out three sentances without turning around the letters in some words, somehow. It is a great source of entertainment in my family, especially when my sisters and I are all together trying to out-talk each other. Then the belly laughs really start.2 - I once had a cassette tape of A Light In The Attic. I listened to it every night at bedtime until finally the tape wore so thin that it broke. I have almost every single Shel Silverstein book, and I even won second place in a poetry recitation in grade school for reciting \\"Sara Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take The Garbage Out\\". I just find great joy in reading his stories and poetry.Runny Babbit was a wonderful gift to recieve, especially for someone like me, who gets a kick out of my own speech problems.

You'd better, because every last page uses the same letter-switching joke. In lesser hands this would be too much, but Shel Silverstein -- the master of expressive line drawings and simple witticisms -- creates a work of constrained genius. Runny Babbit is a hilariously hapless but bold character who has adorable little adventures (My favorite is the poem about the \\"Ficken Charmer.\\") This will be best appreciated by the 4-7 year old set who love a good \\"spoonerism,\\" but even though it's no \\"Sidewalk Ends\\" (what is?) it's a worthwhile read and necessary addition to any Silverstein collection."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"In this book There are usefull details to understand this country and people.

For anybody interested in Afghanistan this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Taking the long view, one can certainly see the evolution of a society and its politics from this work.Personally, I think that the economic life of a country and its geography fashion many of its aspects but Ewans glosses over these if he mentions them at all. Afghanistan sits in the middle of the great Silk Road and serves as a path between East and West. It also seems to have a fruitful climate in parts and, according to the UN, has a population of over 28,000,000.During the 19th century \\"Great Game\\" rivalry between Russia and England, it became a pawn and suffered TWO wars with Britain with a third just after WWI.The writing is a bit dry, lacking human \\"juice\\" for its characters. Yet it packs a lot of history into 299 pages of text.As a counterpoint, I'd recommend \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" by Ben MacIntyre which focuses on a single American adventurer in Afghanistan circa 1830. One gets a much better human and cultural understanding of the country and its people during that limited period.As other commenters have noted, the most recent period from just before the Russian invasion through the Taliban's rule is the weakest portion. It does assemble a large number of facts I've not seen consolidated elsewhere. However, he seems to go far too easy on the Communist ideology that bears a great resemblance to the rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and resulted in much the same carnage and disorders. The failure of the indigenous Communists eventually resulted in the Russian invasion.One unsupported assertion is that efforts by the US and NATO to suppress the Taliban following 9/11/2001 have increased the number of terrorists. Recent polls from Afghanistan show great support from the people there for the US-lead effort and disgust with the Taliban. The author seems to adopt the Euro standard disdain for American aid to the trouble Afghan people.Worthy of the four stars but with some significant weaknesses. It just fails to give one a complete, balanced, and coherent knowledge of Afghanistan."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Afghanistan's history is almost entirely one of war, hostility and revenge. Martin Ewans' short work, although providing only a high level view, covers these bloody events that traverse the centuries.Unfortunately, Ewans' work is often not easy reading. His prose is dry and wordy. It requires a patient mind to persevere. However, attention to detail can be rewarding as Ewans slowly unravels the internecine politics of Afghanistan.To understand the modern history of Afghanistan, one needs to understand the broad sweep of history. Afghanistan has, in recent times, been the home of modern terrorism. This terrorism has found root in a soil of prejudice and injustice. Indeed, Afghanistan must surely be teetering on the edge of being a failed state. Perhaps it is already at this point?Afghanistan is a tragedy. Yet it is has always been so. Ewans meticulously outlines how this tragedy has unfolded. It is a further tragedy that the West has turned a blind eye to this benighted country. Its people deserve better."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"The author shares a vast knowledge of Afghanistan. A more thorough discussion of the Shinwari tribe and Waziristan would have been useful. The Ghaznavid gold dinar, dated 1011 C.E. depicted in Plate 1, appears to have been struck in Neishabur, though the inscription is not clear where the mint is located. Nadir Shah Afshar's conquest of what was to become Afghanistan in 1747 is brief; however, the discussion of the 20th C. Nadir Shah Abdali is more than adequate."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Good Book. Many names to keep track of but that's history for you. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"This book can be recommended to anyone interested in the history of the general mess now known as Afghanistan. In addition to being scholarly (which some people call \\"dry\\") and concise, Ewans, as a former diplomat, tends to be honest about many issues which Westerners were previously clueless or not bothered about, or which they deliberately \\"fudged up\\", so as to justify their anti-Soviet policy. That is commendable, on part of a Western writer. But it may be too late to do any good now. Before \\"9/11\\" most Western books on this subject tended to be hysterically biased in favour of the \\"Mujahideen\\" Islamic war of resistance, funded by capitalism; now of course, ever since that fateful day of 9/11, on which Bin Laden and his Taliban cohorts gave the West a tremendous kick in the backside, the books are hysterical in a different way. Actually, I agree more with the latter type of hysteria (and not at all the former). It has more than an element of truth in it. In this review, I take the opportunity to add my personal experience to Mr. Ewans' narrative and thereby enhance it. I belong in Peshawar, on the Pakistani side of the ethnic Pashtun (the basic majority Afghan ethnicity, from which it the word \\"Afghan\\" is derived) area. This area was conquered and split, by the British, from Afghanistan and added to their Indian Empire under a treaty finalised in 1893. For that I am thankful in more ways than one. I am half-English, and twenty years ago, as a college student, was a Marxist supporter of Afghanistan's Soviet supported Communist \\"Saur\\" Revolution. Though experience has since nullified most of my beliefs in Marxism and also disillusioned me regarding the nature of Afghan communists - who have proven to be no different than their opposite brethren, the truth of what happened in that war between the Soviets and the American Jihadist Islamic resistance can not be altered. Many Western writers - now that they see what the policies of their countries have led to - try to absolve their countries of blame by dismissing the Afghan episode as resulting from a \\"Vietnam revenge\\" policy of the US. That is childish to say the least; however, it may be the best excuse they can find, since pre-9/11 Western opinion in this regard was that they were \\"freeing\\" the Afghan people so that the latter \\"could live freely according to their own culture and religion...\\" But comparisons with Vietnam are also false and futile. Vietnam's story was the fight of an awakened people for national and economic self-determination against capitalist enslavement; Whereas Afghanistan's was the fight of one of the most misguided, subnormal, gladly backward and morose minded people the world has ever seen - against the benefits of social modernisation; and in this the Afghans were aided by criminal modern world powers who thought that doing so would further their greedy geopolitical objectives (\\"9/11\\" proved otherwise though! The USSR, Capitalism's \\"greatest enemy\\" is nowhere to be seen, and has been replaced by rabid Islamic fanatics who \\"can't be seen\\" till they explode!) The Booklist editorial review of Martin Ewans' book on this page is rightly pessimistic when it says that only \\"modern\\" (19th and 20th c.) Afghan history matters to the world, since: \\"There aren't a lot of bright spots in modern Afghan history. The people share no linguistic, religious, or ethnic traditions and have come together only to fight common enemies. Two wars with the British and the mujahadeen resistance against the Soviets devastated both the people and the economy, but the anarchy following the wars was equally crippling. Often lacking a centralized government, the few rulers Afghanistan has known, from Daoud to Mullah Omar, have been charismatic personalities but hugely ineffective leaders... Afghanistan has known no peace in 40 years and little peace in all its history...\\" That speaks for itself. The mess is even more exacerbated by the devastating Islamic fire the West and its lackeys kindled in the world because of this; and shame be upon those traitorous \\"modern\\" Afghans who fled to the West to live a \\"better life\\" so easily."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"For anyone interested in the history of Afghanistan, its culture, and people, you cannot go wrong in reading this book."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Just what I was looking for.

However, the title \\"A Short History\\" may be a bit misleading, as this is, in fact, a thorough examination of Afghan history with some rather dense writing. Certainly it is more for those seriously interested in the subject matter rather than the casual reader.Another thing to consider is that this book covers Afghanistan from its earliest days to the modern era. Personally, I was most interested in Afghanistan's ancient history as well as the contemporary period, especially the Taliban and the current U.S. military presence. Instead its ancient history is only briefly discussed, with the bulk of the book being devoted to the 1800's and 1900's. The book does offer substantial and insightful coverage of the Soviet occupation, the mujahidin and the Taliban. But, since the book was written in 2002, it's not completely up to date on what is currently happening in Afghanistan. So someone primarily interested in post-Taliban Afghanistan might do better with one of the many books devoted solely to the contemporary era.Still Ewans is a extremely intelligent man and has tremendous amounts of information and insight to convey regarding Afgan history. This one is worth reading for those with a serious interest in the country"},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"I liked this book, had no problem reading it, and recommend it. Presumably when reviewers refer to it as \\"dry\\", they mean in comparison to such popular histories as Peter Hopkirk's fascinating \\"The Great Game\\". But, Hopkirk's point of view lends to the events an air of \\"the plucky British soldiers\\" fighting against \\"incredible odds\\" in their 19th century incursions into Afghanistan. What happened is that the disciplined British military with the aid of superior tactics and weaponry massacred numerous Afghanis in their quest to keep their Indian empire secure (from a Russian invasion that might never have occurred anyway), and, in due course, suffered some massacres of their own. I don't suggest Hopkirk whitewashed these events. Rather, he knows a story is more appealing with \\"heros\\" and \\"villains\\", and constructing these is how the very readable \\"The Great Game\\" makes a century of fairly detailed Central Asian history palatable.Ewans's book lacks heros and villains. It's briefer and is consciously even-handed, written with a diplomat's grasp of how the personalities of leaders and the policies of powerful countries towards poor ones steer events. If you want a pithy review of Afghanistan's interactions with the world's great powers, its politics, and the succession of leaders from Dost Mohammed forward, this is your book. It certainly served me well.Weaknesses of this book include, first, the sketchiness of the pre-19th century history and, second, a sharp focus on leaders and politics giving little idea of how ordinary Afghans lived, especially in rural areas (that is, until the closing chapters dealing with the Communist government, Soviet invasion, and regimes of the Mujahidin and Taliban). I'd like to know more about life in and leaders of the powerful rural tribes, who for 150 years have erected road blocks to the policies of kings, prime ministers, and presidents.One source for conditions in the country-side are the travelogues of 20th century adventurers: Robert Byron \\"The road to Oxiana\\" (1930s - 6 stars out of a possible 5, though about 2/3s of that book concerns Iran), Eric Newby \\"A short walk in the Hindu Kush\\" (1950s - humor in the mountains), and Peter Levi \\"The light garden of the angel king\\" (1970s - next on my stack to read, but seems highly regarded by all)."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"This is a great book for readers interested in a brief survey of Afghanistan's political history and foreign relations from ancient times to 9/11. Author Ewans, a retired British diplomat who served in Kabul, writes superbly, stays focused on issues that are important and interesting, and has a droll sense of the role played by stupidity in foreign affairs. The highlights are the chapters on Anglo-Afghan relations in the 19th century and the Soviet occupation and civil war in the 1980s and 1990s. Ewans does stumble in early chapters that reshash boring dynastic histories from the middle ages (hence my rating of four stars), but this is the only flaw in an otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Afghanistan: A Short History of Its People and Politics, by Martin Ewans, is a fantastic book. This fascinating account of this plucky country was chock full of facts that have immediate relevance. Covering from ancient times to 2002, this book provides a traditional history--no stories of the working classes or women. But it covers the byzantine regime changes of Afghanistan very well. It als does a fine job of explaining how the Afghanistan state was in constant tension between the local tribal powers and the more modern central authority of the king. The foreign situation was also an exercise in balance, with the Afghans depending on money, guns and expertise from British India to fend off the Russian Empire. However, the relationship with the Brits wasn't entirely godlen, as the three Anglo-Afghan wars suggest.While the history was intensely interesting, the last chapters of the book, which cover the politics and battles of the last two decades which have left Afghanistan such a mess, were the most relevant for me. If you want to know how mcuh the CIA spent supporting the Taliban, it's in there. If you want to know which external nations supported which of the warring factions, it's in there. If you want to know why Afghanistan grows the majority of the world's opium, it's in there.I won't say this book was easy to get through. The writing is quite dense. The frequent re-appearance of characters was at times confusing, but I fear that is more a feature of Afghan history. For a concise political history of a nation that we're becoming more and more involved with, check out this book."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Martin Ewans has given us a useful, highly readable introduction to the people and history of Afghanistan. It begins with a short introduction on the geography and the ethno-linguistic groups of the modern nation. Unfortunately, because it is only a general survey, a serious student will find this material inadequate. Moreover, Ewans' knowledge and experience as a diplomat can work against him as a scholar -- he relies too heavily on assertion and background knowledge, where the book would have profited from better footnotes and sourcing, especially for the modern era where his assertions are more controversial.Just as one example, he asserts that \\"the Afghan fiasco was also one of the catalysts that led to the break-up of the Soviet Union on the late 1980s and early 1990s\\" (p. 169, all citations are to the hardback edition). I use this example because a detailed defense of this statement is clearly beyond the scope of a book on Afghanistan, and yet it is conroversial enough that Ewans should at least refer us to a book that does discuss the question.This problem is minor for the first thirteen chapters or so, simply because political/social bias does not usually color historical works the further back in time one goes. This book easily earns three stars for these informative and useful chapters (although, again, the serious student will only find it useful as a starting point).Chapters 14 through 18 cover the Afghan communist movement, through the Soviet invasion, through civil war, and the advent of the Taliban. Ewans does a good job of simplifying extremely complex issues, but again, not without problems. In describing the mujahidin, he acknowledges that \\"there are dangers in being too dogmatic in describing and classifying them.\\" (pp. 153-54). But he continues to describe the very different (in terms of ideology, techniques, foreign support and degrees of success) groups with the broad label \\"mujahidin.\\" This tendency is odd at first, but becomes more frustrating in the civil war chapters, where the different groups start to fight among themselves.In final two chapters and epilogue, Ewans goes from historian to pundit, offering an analysis of the current state of Afghanistan, the blame for its problems, and where it will go in the future. As usual, some of his assertions are without support. On page 211, he quotes \\"one distinguished academic\\" without even identifying who that academic is, let alone the source of the quote.He claims that \\"If there is to be a tolerable outcome, there will somehow have to be a settlement of all these issues, no doubt brokered by the united nations\\" (p. 214). This sentence is objectionable for a number of reasons. First, a \\"tolerable\\" outcome in a nation state does not necessarily involve the resolution of all problems (England's hyper-aggressive colonialism and denial of political rights in the 19th century, or America's constitutional protection of slavery for over a century, are black spots on their records, but don't make them \\"failed states\\"). Ewans points out that the Afghan government cannot provide for its citizens' basic needs, but it is by no means clear that a government is responsible for satisfying basic needs in the first place. Second, Ewans does not explain why the United Nations, with a striking track record of failure in resolving international conflicts, should suddenly become successful in Afghanistan. Ewans' own evidence underscores this point: starting with a totally useless resolution condemning the Soviet invasion (because the Russians have a veto power on the Securit Council; p. 151), and continuing through the present (because of the Taliban's total lack of concern with world opinion), all attempts to use the United Nations to broker political reconciliation have produced no results at all.His conclusions frequently contradict the evidence he produces in previous chapters. He claims that in Afghanistan, \\"a fiercely independent people have been more determined than almost any other to resist outside interference...\\" (p. 213). But Ewans' own survey belies his exaggeration of their independence. The warring mujahidin groups and the Taliban all receive foreign cash, training and equipment, from nations such as America, Iran and Pakistan, while Najibullah's government was directly controlled and armed by the Soviets. The pre-occupation communists (Taraki, Karmal and Amin) received education and political support from the Soviets. All previous presidents and kings accepted at least financial assitance from Russians, Americans and/or British, in the form of technical assistance, loans on highly favorable terms, roads, airports, military equipment and training, and a massive (but failed) dam project for the Helmand valley. In what sense, then, have the Afghans demonstrated their determination to resist outside interference?A few final thoughts. This is primarily a political/military history. Religion and culture primarily figures only as an explanation for political developments. The few maps are good, but could be better (not all of the place-names mentioned in the text are shown in the maps). The writing style is straightforward and highly readable. And at only 214 pages, the book is fast and never boring. All in all, this is not a bad book by any means. It simply fails to live up to its potential, and so cannot rate more than three stars."},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Afghanistan: A Short History of Its People and PoliticsBy Martin EwansThis short and quick read easily lives up to its title.

May of the conspiracy theories that this book says Afghans hold to the influence of Britian, the US or Russia on their lives have been echoed by the interpreters that I had here in country.The book is good for anyone who wants an overview of Afghanistan's history in the last two centuries. While the book touches on Alexander and Genghis Khan, it does not give them nearly the treatment of some other books.

New York: Harper Collins Publishers. Contains 37 pictures and 8 maps; Appendix; Extensive Notes.Martin Ewans's book on Afghanistan is a well-organized, and well-documented source on not only the history of Afghanistan, but also its people. The book is divided into twenty-one chapters. The beginning chapters deal with the Afghani people, as well as their religion and the geographical location of the country. However, the main emphasis of the book deals with the history of Afghanistan and all of the leaders and conquerors it has had. According to Ewans, there is no documented history of Afghanistan until the sixth century BC, when the empire of Cyrus the Great absorbed it. However, the book does not go into in-depth history until the period of Alexander the Great when he made Afghanistan part of his empire while trying to conquer the world. Due to all of the turnover in leaders after the book does a quick overview of the leaders after Alexander the Great, approximately the time period from the 300 BC until the 1700's.After the 1500's the book begins to go into extensive coverage of the emergence of the first Afghan kingdom in the 1700's under the rule of the Ghilzai tribe, when it revolted against the Safavids. Ewan goes on to say that after a lot of in-fighting and revolt, Shah Amhed Kahn emerged as the leader of what is now today Afghanistan.The book then moves on to the 1800's when Dost Mohammed rose to power through the use of force when he took Kabul. The book then delves into the first and second Anglo-Afghan wars, each having one chapter devoted to it. After these chapters, Ewans devotes approximately on chapter to the successive rulers of Afghanistan. The book breezes through Afghan history until the rule of Mohammed Daoud Kahn in the 1950's. The book explains how Daoud found himself in the middle of the Cold War and how he tended to side with his Soviet neighbors. However, this ended when the royal family, in pursuit of a constitutional monarchy, forced Daoud to resign in 1957. The book then discuss the rule of King Zahir and his constitutional monarchy until he was overthrown in a coup by Daoud himself while the king was in Italy for eye surgery. However, this reign only lasted for five years, when Daoud is also overthrown in a coup by the PDPA. The book then deals with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The book devotes three chapters to the Soviet invasion, dealing with the invasion itself, the occupation of the soviets and the resistance of the Afghani people, and eventually the withdrawal of the soviets. The book then deals with the civil war that ensued after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, ending with the short rule of Sebghatullah Mujadidi. After this period, Ewan discusses the entrance of the Taliban and their subsequent rise to power. Ewan devotes two chapters to the Taliban, ending the book with a quizzical outlook on the future of Afghanistan. Ewan feels that as long as the Taliban and their opponents are in opposition of each other, the future of Afghanistan is highly speculative. An epilogue is added to discuss the September eleventh events, and Ewan ends his book describing Afghanistan as a \\"failed state\\". However, Ewan goes on to say that bin Laden and his followers represent a sick and twisted mind and a subculture of religious fanaticism. Ewan ends his book with acknowledging the issue of global terrorism but says that it is outside the scope of the book, as well as the Muslim attitude towards the West.Bryon Wait"},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Ewans, Martin, Afghanistan: A Short Story of Its People and Politics, (New York: HarperCollins, 2002). Pp. ix, 244. 37 Ill. 8 Maps. Epilogue. Annotated Bibliography. Index. ISBN: 0-06-050507-9.Afghanistan: A Short Story of Its People and Politics is a complete and concise synopsis of Afghanistan's leaders and foreign occupation. It gives a quick chronology of its many leaders, including Alexander the Great and ending with the Taliban. Furthermore, it describes the interplay between politics, especially in regards to Kabul, and the people of Afghanistan, relaying the constant power struggle either within Afghanistan or against foreign powers.Martin Ewans is a credible source in terms of an accurate historical record. He served as a U.S. diplomat to both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and relies upon a wide variety of references for his information. In this respect, the book is extremely useful for the average reader looking for a quick overview of Afghani history. Moreover, the focus upon leadership and occupation sheds much light upon the present day struggle for autonomy and the extreme antagonism/skepticism of Afghani leaders towards foreign powers.However, in the last two chapters of the book, Ewans describes the contemporary position of Afghanistan, in particular the rise of the Taliban and future outlook for the country. This on first glance appears to be extremely useful, as there are very few up to date books on Afghanistan that include the 9/11 attack and modern perspective on the Taliban. Yet, Ewans goes too far here, condemning Afganistan as a failed and \\"wretched\\" state. His opinions on the Taliban leadership contradict one another, and it is clear a hint of bias enters the author's attitude towards the end of the novel. He goes so far as to deem Afghanistan the center of global terrorism.On the one hand, Ewans may indeed be correct in these opinions. But, the underlying tone seems to point towards the notion of unsupported and hasty conclusions of the part of the author, who had for the better part of the novel maintained an objective point of view. Now, more than ever, an attitude of understanding and hope for the state of Afghanistan is needed to help its people. To call it a wretched state and the center of global terror will only further antagonism and prevent cooperation with Afghanistan for both the masses and foreign diplomats. Hence, while I would recommend the book for a quick overview of Afghani history, I would warn the reader against giving creit to the author's bias towards the end of the book.Shirin Raza"},{"Title":"The Yeager family circle from hither to yonder: Yager, Yeager, Jager, Germany to America, 1600's to 1991","review":"Former diplomat Martin Ewans' interest in Afghanistan shines in this well-written book on the history of Afghanistan and the events that has made this country what it is today. Ewans talks about the ancient history, the rise of the Pashtun, the British domination which warped and jaded the fabled compassion and openness of the people, the often overlooked and turbulent developments of the mid-20th century and a rare and balanced view of the soviet occupation from 1979 to the mid-eighties.For students of Afghanistan who have trouble wading through dry histories, this book is a breath of fresh air. Well written and engaging, this work does not get bogged down with an overabundance of details, but rather gives a clear layout of the histories inlaid with rich details that bring to life the people who made the history.

There are pilots, war photographers, disc jockeys, spies, soldiers, members of congress -- so many women who stepped up and took part in the war, often in spite of great opposition. (And it doesn't shy away from telling about a few women who were not so noble during the war either.)I had never seen the women of WWII placed in this light -- as equal partners in fighting and winning.

Now, with WWII veterans dying at a rate of over 1,000 per day, those voices will all too soon become silent. WWII was the first time women joined the military, and they encountered prejudice and hardships every step of the way. The women and nurses who served in the military witnessed horrors that many of the men encountered, but with much less preparation and little resource for healing after the war. All but forgotten for the roles they performed, this book brings to light their stories by both the women themselves, as well as the author's research and study. Much of the information is rarely found in available books, and \\"Our Mothers War\\" is an excellent resource for that information- particularly on the lesser known women's roles on the homefront, in espionage, and those who were taken as prisoners of war. Women volunteered to help the war effort in every possible way. The accounts tell stories of war as well as stories of the lighter side of day-to-day living that was the human side of life during WWII.An excellent overall account of women in the 1940's, and one that will likely encourage the reader to delve deeper into our nation's history of female veterans, women's roles and the women's movement."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War : American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II","review":"This isn't meant to be some exhaustive encyclopedia, but it's nevertheless a very solid thorough detailed account of what the women of the WWII generation went through, in many facets and fields. Besides just writing about the women in the military, in the factories, on the general homefront, and in the Japanese-American internment camps, there is also interesting insightful information on areas little covered, such as the women who worked at or who had husbands working at Los Alamos, prostitutes, women in right-wing pro-Fascist groups agitating against the American government, and spies. It's stunning to read about all the women of my grandmothers' generation had to struggle against to be accepted into the military, in factories, as professionals, in any capacity in fact besides that of wife, mother, sister, and girlfriend. Particularly horrifying was the section on the Victory Girls; the sexual double standard sent women (many of them proven innocent) suspected of passing VD to soldiers to jail, while giving these soldiers no punishment for cavorting with prostitutes and giving them the best care instead of forcing them to languish in dank unhygienic jail cells without medical attention. Blame the women and treat the men as innocent victims. Also shocking in modern times is how women believed to be lesbians in the military were treated, like they had a mental disorder and were deranged unnatural deviants, as well as how many women who had loyally punctually worked in the factories were handed their discharge slips on the day the boys came home. Still, even restrained by the double standard and beliefs of the era, these women had tasted freedom and greater possibilities, and thanks to everything they did, their knowledge of greater possibilities, they raised daughters who would help to bring about the womens' liberation movement in the next generation, knowing they could never go back to the limited world and possibilities that had existed prior to WWII."},{"Title":"Our Mothers' War : American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II","review":"I began doing research on this subj within the last few months and didn't know what a goldmine of information I had hit on when I found this book!!

The author makes it a point to mention a broad spectrum of issues while making sure to highlight where research was located. I consider this a GREAT start to research of my own. She also makes it a point to credit her decision to write it on her mother which puts another whole personal aspect on it.

It is filled with popular history sources and first hand accounts which really gives the reader a clear understanding and a vivid picture of what a woman's life was like during the war. The book isn't too heavy on traditional historical evidence or prose but that is one of the reasons why it reads so fast.

WWII women pilots were in danger of their planes being sabotaged by sugar in the engines, put there by male pilots. Those who were killed by these actions were denied military funerals until 1978. Read this book before you see the documentary \\"The Invisible War\\". This is the current story of service women who are assaulted and raped in today military.

In \\"Gollum: A Behind the Scenes Guide,\\" he talks frankly and easily about how this complex, difficult character was brought from the book to the screen.Andy Serkis was unenthusiastic when he heard that they were searching for actors to play Gollum in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" But after his now-wife began gushing about what a wonderful character Gollum was, he went in for an audition, armed only with a voice that sounded like his cat throwing up hairballs. Not only did Serkis get the role, he also learned that there was more needed for Gollum than just the voice: He had to suit up in a motion capture suit to provide Gollum's movements as well.\\"Gollum: A Behind the Scenes Guide\\" is more than just a guide about how the first really convincing CGI character was created. Serkis also chronicles bits of his everyday life in New Zealand, the birth of his son, September 11th, the premiere of \\"Two Towers,\\" and the more widespread reaction to everybody's favorite Ring junkie (Gollum appeared on SNL and \\"The Simpsons, for example). Not to mention a sweet poem Serkis wrote to his young daughter.To give further dimension to Serkis's story, there are lots of concept drawings and clay statues of Gollum (warning: avoid certain pages unless you're willing to see Gollum naked). There are also detailed sections written by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, the mocap crew, and many others about how they also helped create Gollum. For example, there was a lot of thought given to what kind of nose Gollum should have, or whether he should have a potbelly.Serkis has a nice, conversational style, with plenty of self-deprecating humor and excellent descriptions (\\"... suddenly this bald lunatic in pale green spandex comes lolloping into view. It was like a very bad nightmare, like a Dali painting gone wrong\\"). He's got a nice vocabulary and a great actor's sense, getting into Gollum's bald little head. And despite his claims of \\"ignorance of great literature,\\" he makes some nice references to Narnia, Shakespeare, Dickens, Hugo, and ancient Norse sagas.Andy Serkis and the people at WETA created movie history with the flawless Gollum. And Serkis's mini-memoir about how Gollum came to life is not just a good book for \\"Rings\\" fans, but for cinephiles and movie students as well. It's our precious."},{"Title":"Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic (The Lord of the Rings)","review":"I guess I'm a bit of a geek and I just love the character of Gollum in The lord of the Rings movies and in The Hobbit. At the same time I think Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor, with a bit of nice humor - so this book is just a great way to get a behind-the-scenes look of how this character was made. Normally I don't like to read books, but this is brilliant, informative and funny.Would recommend it to any LOTR & Hobbit fans who are interested in knowing a bit more about how it was made."},{"Title":"The Pirotechnia of Vannoccio Biringuccio","review":"This is not an easy book to read. It predates Agriccola's De Re Metallica by several years, and has not yet made the bridge of thought from alchemy into chemistry. As a result, the section on fireworks speaks of principles of air and such to explain how they work.Additionally, many of the usages are different than we think of them today. For example, in the production of Aqua Fortis (nitric acid), one of the steps involves the use of red alum. After 10 years of research, I finally figured out that this referred to alunite, a mineral alum found in a certain mine in Italy which contained a high level of iron.Given the difficulty in interpreting what is being said, it is still an invaluable book to researchers in the field. It contains valuable information about the thought and processes in use in Italian metallurgy in the 16th century."},{"Title":"Feast of Unreason","review":"This is a review for Hector Hawton's Philospohy for Pleasure, which I could not find doing a search on Amazon, rather than The Feast of Unreason, so that's why I'm writing this here instead. I hope Amazon will include this review in this section, because I have to say what a wonderful little book this is. I've read dozen's of introductory books on philosophy and this book, by an amateur philosopher who pursued it as a hobby rather than a professional philosopher, is quite simply the best primer ever written in the area. Hawton's book is clear, concise and even pithy. He cuts through all the jargon and the tangle of philosophical schools and ideas to distill what is really important about them. An important facet of his presentation is how each idea improved over previous thinking, and then was taken up and influenced and was modified by later philosophers. The book is only a couple of hundred pages long, but after reading this you will be prepared to take on more serious readings on the subject."},{"Title":"Evaristo Carriego","review":"Escrib&iacute; una rese&ntilde;a a la versi&oacute;n en ingl&eacute;s, para quien le interese.

The angel is professional hockey player Martin Cartier's late daughter seeking to resolve the issues that her death left in Martin's life.Kylie tells Martin to help them shortly before the plane makes an unscheduled emergency landing and Martin is instantly intrigued by both Kylie and especially by her attractive single mother, May. After a brief courtship, both are firmly in love and the only issue seems to be whether May should apply her wedding planning business skills or whether they should elope (Martin just wants what makes May happy).For me, this first half of the novel was pleasant but unremarkable. We didn't see what made these two people uniquely right for one another. Martin's extreme reactions to questions about his past were consistent with author Luanne Rice's descriptions of his upbringing, but were nevertheless unpleasant and unheroic as were his frequent decisions to desert May and Kylie.The second half of the novel, and especially the conclusion, were much more emotionally satisfying. Rice handled the psychic elements with a delicate touch--enough to add to the plot yet little enough that the characters themselves had to resolve their issues.If you decide to read this book, and on net, I enjoyed it, make sure you keep reading through the relatively bland beginning. The emotional payoff is at the end."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This is a story of love,betrayal and love renewed.It revolves around Martin Cartier,May Taylor and her daughter,Kylie.Martin is a professional hockey player and a sport's legend;May is a wedding planner and Kylie possesses a sixth sense, which enables her to see/talk to angels. On a flight that is in trouble Martin comes to the aid of May ,facilitated by a vision from Kylie.This meeting opens the door to a great love between them. After Martin's believing that they were meant for each other,he feels betrayed by May and disappears, only to reappear and marry May. Their love is so intense,but Martin's moods govern his behavior,and one does wonder how May can remain so loyally loving to a man who disappears at the least provocation.Martin's estranged father,Serge, a former championship hockey player himself, is in prison. His daughter,Natalie,died accidently when with Serge, and Martin refuses to forgive him.Natalie's angel appears to Kylie,wanting her to reunite the two, as does May, who has secretly visited Serge. A tragedy causes Martin to totally withdraw from May and Kylie,but there is a miraculous resolution between all parties that seals their love. This is a beautifully written story and Luanne Rice so well portrays the enotions of the various characters. She weaves a tale that will leave you happy with the outcome despite the unexpected events that change the course of their lives. This book is as compelling as &quot;Dream Country.&quot;"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"As a wedding planner May Taylor sees happy betrothed couples daily. However, that kind of happiness has evaded her. She once thought she had that kind of lasting love only to find, after telling her boyfriend she was pregnant with their child, that he was already married. May has spent the ensuing six years dealing with her business and caring for her daughter, Kylie.Kylie is being studied by psychologists after she has experienced strange visions, one of which occurs while she and her mother are flying home from one of her psychologist visits. She tells Boston Bruins hockey star Martin Cartier, sitting ahead of them in first class, to help her and her mom. Martin has no idea what Kylie means but when the airplane crash lands, he rushes to assist Kylie and May.Martin Cartier is the star right wing for the Boston Bruins. Known as the Gold Sledgehammer, he has his share of female admirers and has even dated a few. But they were nothing more than a classy accessory to him. When he meets May it's different. Somehow he knows they were meant to be together.As Martin begins to court May, it isn't long before she begins the feel the same way and soon the wedding planner is planning her own wedding.But Martin has some secrets in his past. Secrets he has told no one. He also has some well-known family tragedies he is reluctant to talk about including the death of his young daughter, Natalie, and his estrangement from his father, a hockey hall of famer, now serving time in prison for racketeering.Martin is a huge star. One who has led his team to the Stanley Cup finals several years in a row. He wants nothing more than to win the championship - something that has evaded him. During hockey season he is driven - he has only one thing on his mind - win the championship and take the Stanley Cup away from his arch rival Nils Jorgenson.Kylie's visions have seemed to increase since Martin has come into her life. In fact, she is now seeing visions and communicating with Martin's deceased daughter, Natalie. Of course, no one believes her even when she tells them she is meant to \\"bring them together\\" - but bring who together? And how?Despite some uncertainties, May, Martin, and Kylie are forging a happy life together. Summers spent at Lac Vert in Canada, Martin's childhood home, are nearly idyllic. However hockey injuries Martin has suffered all of his life come back to haunt him threatening everything he has learned to care about. As the old Bible verse Martin's mother cross-stitched years ago \\"And a child shall lead them\\" comes into play, will Martin and his family get the miracle they need?This was an enjoyable story for those who like a little of the supernatural in their stories (angels - and who's to say things like this can't happen?). Kylie is really the star of this book, sort of a younger version of the character Haley Joel Osment played in \\"The Sixth Sense.\\"Rice has detailed the hockey world superbly, making even this non-hockey fan wanting to watch a game, so this shouldn't be a turn-off for those who don't like stories about sports heroes. Those scenes are really a fairly small part of the book. The story is more of the relationships between husband and wife, husband and daughter, husband and stepdaughter, father and son, and even between friends.Luanne Rice is a wonderful storyteller and her books are now on my auto-buy list. I would compare her with such wonderful authors as Kristin Hannah or Barbara Delinsky. I even spent 4th of July reading it as others around me were celebrating the holiday. SUMMER LIGHT is truly a special read and it's highly recommended."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Summer Light is my favourite !! I think this is the best novel of Luanne Rice. Summerlight was the first book that I read of Luanne. Through Amazone, I came across and gladly found her novels !! Summerlight proved that my believe, &quot;Angels and love&quot;, do exist in this world.What, May Taylor and her daughter, Kylie experienced in their life as Kylie helped her mother to find love and hapiness as what my daughter and I went through life together in few years back.May Taylor of the Bride Barn also mentioned &quot;Twice&quot; in Firefly Beach at Firefly Ball. May Taylor knows Caroline Renwick. My smile came to me when read this part in Firefly. How wonderful I thought!!I think that it is so great that Luanne Rice had put the above excellent personal touch into her novels. I think it makes the reader, I don't know about others but for me it did, feels involved and want to read more and more of her next book. As I now just discovered that her next book &quot;Safe Harbour&quot; has Sam Trevor, Joe Connor's brother, of Firefly Beach as a main male character. This is so great, Just can't wait for &quot;Safe Harbour&quot; to come to New Zealand."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"In Luanne Rice's latest, a single mother with a wedding planner business is courted by a famous hockey player. May Taylor has a daughter who sees and speaks with angels. The six year old Kylie has a special gift, the gift of prophecy. Though May takes Kylie to psychiatrists and other doctors, the child continues to have &quot;visions&quot;. Kylie's latest &quot;vision&quot;, following the whirlwind courtship of her mother, May and the famous hockey player Martin Cartier, is that she must find a way to bring Martin and his estranged father together again. Kylie has visions, complete with angels and fairy dust, in which Martin'sdead daughter appears and speaks to her, urging her to help her mother intercede and bring Martin and his father together. But Martin Cartier has secrets of his own, fortified by his continuing failure to win the Stanley Cup for his team. The story was a little too &quot;out there&quot;, with the author using improbable &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;visions&quot; to make it work. Much of the tale is a fairy tale, and what is real enough just doesn't make a bestseller."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I love this book!! It is in my top ten favorites!! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! Hockey fans will definitely love it! There aren't many books out there about hockey or even hockey players so when I found this one I knew I had to try it. I definitely wasn't disappointed. Would love to read it again, but sadly don't have the time."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I picked up this book at a used book store. I knew nothing about this author and thought I'd try it. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this book really was! It's been awhile since I've read a book this good. A very well written story and good development of characters. I found myself unable to do anything else but read this book. I can't wait to read more books by this author."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Having started by reading Rice's Cloud Nine, which I thought was very good, I have become more and more disappointed, first by Dream Country, then by Summer Light. The leap to fantasy (angels, angel dust, etc.) I could make, but unrealistic details I could not overlook.Where is there a high-security prison in which an inmate is able to converse with a young boy standing outside the fence? At one point the boy even touches the inmate's shoe!! And this child has apparently arrived at the prison on foot. I don't know about the rest of you, but the high-security prisons I'm aware of aren't in quite such friendly neighborhoods.I was also bothered by Rice repeatedly casting the Stanley Cup finals in May. I don't follow hockey but I know I'm still hearing news about the game in June.These inconsistencies create such a feeling of unease that it's impossible to accept the &quot;truth&quot; of the rest of the story. Very disappointing. Surely the last of hers that I will try."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I was in my favorite bookstore a month or so ago and asked one of the employees for some help in introducing me to a new author. I was tired of reading the same old authors time and time again. She told me about Luanne Rice and reccomended that I read Summer Light. I bought the book and had it read within a few days time. I loved this book! I am now hooked on her books and have borrowed 5 of them from my mother!! It isn't often that an author can get me so hooked on a book that I don't want to clean house, cook, etc.!!The plot in Summer Light has ups and downs just like real life does. The child in this story is fascinating and I am a true believer that we all have angels surrounding us. We just have to be open to it to believe. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone!! I can't wait to dive into the rest of Luanne Rice's books!!!!!"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I'd only read one other Luanne Rice title before picking up &quot;Summer Light&quot;, and although I enjoyed it (Firefly Beach), Summer Light has it beaten, hands down . It's truly been a while since I got up early to continue reading a book, but I did it for this one. This book was fantastic.It had everything. May Taylor is a quiet, reserved woman, making the best out of a life that has left her dissappointed too many times. To top it all off, her daughter Kylie is 'gifted' with the ability to talk to, and see, angels. It is through Kylie's frequent trips to various doctors and specialists that May meet hockey legend Martin Cartier.One of Kylie's 'angels' tells her that Martin needs their help, and they need him. After a chance meeting and a freak accident, May and Martin find themselves so deeply in love it seems that nothing can tear them apart.As always happens in the books we love the most, reality is a nasty presense in the lives of our fictional heros, and May, Martin and Kylie must all face their own demons. Struggling to build their family and protect their future, the Cartier's must make their peace with the past.By the last three chapter of 'Summer Light' I was constantly dabbing at the tears. I was totally touched by Ms. Rice's story, and found little Natalie to be as real as any other character in the book. This is a book I will HAVE to lend to friends, because I know how much they will enjoy it. And I know that I'll be keeping &quot;Summer Light&quot; handy enough to read again soon. Great characters, great story, great romance, great, great ending. Need I say more =:)"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and I am afraid it will be my only one. I really liked the part with Kylie and Natalie, it could have been such a wonderful book but the author ruined it with the Martin and May. Martin was such an a**hole, who would have ever put up with that and subject your daughter to that type of behavior. May was a nag and should have shut up about his father. I think if the book would have been about a hundred pages shorter and all the yelling left out it would have been a great book. I just could not stand all the drama. Who wants to read that crap?"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book; on one hand, I felt it was a nice plot with several levels of personal interaction going on - I really enjoyed the scenes with Kylie (I actually wanted her visions to go a little deeper) - but I think it would have been much more believable and appealing if Martin had been more of a regular kind of guy - not The Sexiest Athlete Alive, The Most Eligible Bachelor in the NHL, etc...like some other posters, I was also annoyed by all the hockey errors, I was annoyed by May's nagging about his father and daughter (I didn't really blame him for leaving), and I absolutely could NOT believe that ANY father who loved his son AT ALL would have allowed him to be tortured, and I couldn't understand why that episode was even in there (to show how tough Martin was? to show what a bastard Serge was?) but then never really resolved, or even given any real importance. I also wasn't thrilled with the ending. Martin changed way too much - I don't believe people do that. Oh, and his ego - what the heck was wrong with him, continuing to play when he knew his vision was going bad??? That's not a nice thing to do to your team...Ms Rice doesn't go into his teammates' reactions to his blindness, but I don't think they would have been happy to know that he'd compromised them for the sake of his pride. Hockey is a TEAM sport, above all else - then again, the way this book was written, one must believe that a single player (a defenseman at that) scores ALL the goals. All in all, I think this could have been a really good book - but the devil was in the details, like owl poop all over expensive dresses."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"At its center, this is a romance novel--the story of how unlucky-in-love May Taylor and famous-but-lonely hockey player Martin Cartier find each other--but it's also much more than that. May and Martin are brought together by May's daugther, Kylie, who seems to have a special gift of seeing things others do not. One of the things she claims to see is Martin's long-dead daughter, Natalie, who may have a vital message for her father. Martin refuses to speak of Natalie, and he blames his own father, Serge, a once-great hockey player in his own right, for her death. Ultimately, it is all of these relationships plus others which make this a more rich, complex novel. One problem I had with the book is that the character of Martin is not always sympathetic; at least from my own women's perspective, it was hard for me to understand at times why May continued to put up with him. Regardless, I still found this to be an engaging read, and I will definitely look into other work by this author."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This was one of the few books I had to put down in the middle of reading it. I just couldn't stand to waste another minute of my time. The inconsistency is ridiculous and makes believing the story impossible. Who would allow owls to come into a bridal planning establishment which houses very expensive gowns? The main character was as limp as a boneless chicken. I love hockey which is what drew me to this book, but this guy scored so many goals it was like reading about a video game, not a hockey game. By the way, soapbox derby cars don't have engines. Check your facts. I read Cloud Nine and should have known better to buy this book.

This book however, was highly enjoyable. I couldn't put it down after i started to read it. I have a soft spot for stories like these. It was quite moving and i loved all the characters. They made the book and story come alive. To the people who think it's to sappy for them, i say, then why read novels that have a romantic vibe about them? Aren't they all just going to be too sappy for you? All in all...great summer read. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I am a major hockey fan and have met and come to know many Canadian players' wives and girlfriends locally over the years. I thought this story was exceptionally true to life both in the background details and the characters. I know how hockey players think and act, and this caught the essence of their emotions, actions, superstitions and beliefs perfectly. What an extraordinary job Ms. Rice did with the blend of hockey details and each character's \\"wounded past\\" which they must overcome to find true love and peace within!! Kylie's magical presence was the perfect touch, and so were May's and Martin's friends who supported them along the way. I cried my eyes out at the end, which says just how deep the emotional impact was for me. I am a writer (and avid reader) who aspires to publish someday soon, and this provided me with a perfect example of how to bring it all full circle. Brava, Ms. Rice!!! I would love to see you write sequels to this with other hockey players and the women in their lives."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"One of my friends handed me this book saying &quot;I know you don't really go for the mushy stuff, but this book has a hockey player in it!&quot; I think it only took 24 hours for me to read this one. (I admit I read some while at work)I'm obviously a hockey fan, and I got a chuckle out of the 2-0 overtime win too. My one hockey gripe though, was the &quot;facemask&quot; thing. The players I see wear helmets, and occasionally a face shield on the helmet. Only the goalies have full face protection (unless you're in juniors).All in all, a good quick read that I enjoyed enough that I'm thinking about buying my own copy to read again sometime (we passed the copy I read on to another female hockey fan - share the love!). I'd love to see another hockey novel like this - showing the players as very human."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This book was an enjoyable read. Classic tale of two people falling in love and healing past hurts. What made this interesting for me was the supernatural aspects of the child being able to talk to angels and how Martin coped with losing his sight. That was what made the story from merely a lovely read to an enjoyable one.Definitely a great hammock book! I was laying in my hammock reading this one."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This is the first book that I've read by Luanne Rice, the beautiful cover actually drew me to it on the shelf; however, once I started reading it, I could not put it down.

Could not wait for Summer Light to come out in paperpack and I'm glad I didn't wait. This is her best book since Cloud Nine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Luanne Rice's past two novels have been much &quot;lighter&quot; fare than her previous work. Her characters are still well developed and believable; their emotions and problems are real and grab your attention and heart. May and her daughter Kylie are easy to care about; a hardworking single mother dancing on the edge of exhaustion and her troubled daughter. Are the angels Kylie sees real, or is she emotionally damaged by a truly horrific walk through the woods?Into their lives comes Martin Cartier, an aging hockey star with a multitude of unresolved issues-the death of his daughter; his criminal, former hockey superstar father;his diminishing eyesight; and his quest to lead the Boston Bruins to the Stanley Cup.The dialogue and relationship between May and Kylie is beautiful and completely believable. I truly felt the depth of May's love for her daughter, as well as her fears and frustrations with Kylie's visions. Also wonderful is the relationship with Tobin, May's best friend since childhood. Luanne Rice excells at the small nuances that make up everyday life relationships.What was difficult for me was accepting the immediate intimacy between May and Martin. Martin came across as a fairly one dimensional character; his arrogance and self involvement led me to wonder why May and other characters found him so lovable. The exception is his complex relationship with Kylie; some of their interplay is truly heartwarming.The first three quarters of &quot;Summer Light&quot; roll quickly along in a fairly traditional romance novel fashion, and the book is a pleasant read. As both a passionate hockey fan and reader, the several errors regarding the sport were annoying. I was truly, truly disappointed however, with a grand happy ending that I found to be unbelievable and poorly thought out. It felt hastily tacked on, and undermined my enjoyment of the rest of the book. Luanne Rice's previous work explored the hearts of women and relationships of families with much more depth and emotion than &quot;Summer Light&quot;. She has shown brilliance at combining elements of spirituality, love and tragedy. I look forward to reading her next book, and am hoping for a renewal of her amazing storytelling ability."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"A Very Good Book. the right word's &quot;Magical&quot;. It's very romantic. It not only teaches about believing in love but it also teaches the importance of family and forgiveness. This book touched my heart. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This book was absolutely perfect for a romance novel and hockey fan like myself. Luanne Rice has to be one of the best writers that I have come accross in a long time. Her take on family relationships is unriveled by any other author I have recently read. This book is a perfect mixture of romance and sports. Don't listen to the reviewer who slammed the book because of its &quot;inconsistencies&quot; - If I want reality, I'll turn on the news. I want romance and a book that tells about the power of love on multiple levels - and this is it!"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This is the first time I've read anything by LuAnne Rice, but it definitely will not be my last.I'm inspired by the way she draws the reader into the lives of these characters and you suddenly find yourself wrapped up in their emotions as if they were your own. I'm eager to see if she is consistent with her style and technique. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"SUMMER LIGHT is a first from Luanne Rice for me, and I am certainly looking forward to her upcoming releases--and FIREFLY BEACH.

Kylie, her sensitive six -year-old daughter, has her worried, though, because Kylie seems to see and sense things that other people don't.On a recent plane trip, Kylie sees an angel near a big giant of a man. When a fire on the plane forces the plane to make an emergency landing, Martin Cartier, the giant and star hockey player for the Boston Bruins, helps Kylie and May off the plane.Attracted to May in a way that he can't explain, Martin begins driving down to Connecticut from Boston to see her. May is different from any of the women that Martin has known. She falls in love with him as a person, not merely the handsome rich hockey star.Life is good for the Cartiers when Martin marries May, and Kylie, Martin, and May become a family. But events from Martin's past threaten to tear them apart even as the future shows signs of tribulations to come. Will their love be strong enough to keep them together amidst the trials of life?Luanne Rice has written an extraordinary novel. Brimming with emotion, SUMMER LIGHT is a tender triumph showing how love can survive even under the most difficult of circumstances. And the touch of the paranormal adds an ethereal dimension to this read. SUMMER LIGHT will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you very glad that you read this novel."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Since 1988 I have been a loyal and avid reader of Luanne Rice&#65533;s books. While browsing at the library years ago I first came across Crazy in Love and today I always look forward to a new Luanne Rice book. That said I must now admit that Summer Light was one of Rice&#65533;s more disappointing books. Yes it did contain many of Rice&#65533;s themes I&#65533;ve come to enjoy which include the love of a couple for each other, the love of a parent for a child and relatives who disappoint us. But ultimately this book was not a satisfying read. And this may very well be the author&#65533;s concentration on angels communing with the dead and the author also delving into the world of extra sensory perception.May is a wedding planner in Hubbard Point, Conn. and the single mother of a very unusual young girl Kaylie. After the death of her great grandmother and a traumatic event, Kaylie begins to see things before they happen and also talks to people who have died. Fearing for her daughter&#65533;s sanity, May seeks the help of paranormal experts who have few clues as to what is happening to Kaylie. On a flight home from an appointment in Canada with these experts, Kaylie asks a man to help save her mother and herself when the plane crashes. The man is a great hockey player, Martin Cartier, who has secrets of his own. These include the death of his young daughter a few years before, and his hatred for his father Serge, also a former hockey player, who is now in prison. This chance encounter between May, Martin and Kaylie and the subsequent plane crash which Kaylie predicted will have far reaching consequences which will lead to their association and the book progresses to another tragedy and a predictable conclusion.Unfortunately for me this was a poor example of Luanne Rice&#65533;s plot and characters development. I never found myself either interested in these people or their situation. I do suggest reading some of Luanne Rice&#65533;s really good books like Blue Moon or Safe Harbor to see how good this author can present a book which leaves you yearning to read more by her. I&#65533;m sorry to say Summer Light just wasn&#65533;t one of them.."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Summer Light by Luanne Rice is a wonderfully heartwarming and touching story. This is definitely Rice at her best! It is romantic and sentimental, without being overbearing, with a touch of the mystical thrown in!May Taylor is a single mother with a \\"gifted\\" daughter, who claims to speak with angels. While flying home to Connecticut, Kylie is warned of the impending aircraft danger by one of her angel friends, and seeks the aid of Martin Cartier to help her and her mother to safety. Not knowing why, Kylie knows that this man will somehow play a role in their lives. Cartier, a tough, kind, and greatly sought after bachelor, is a hockey player with the Boston Bruins. He pursues May until she agrees to marry him.Rice once again weaves magic with her characters and one cannot help but fall right into their lives and into their emotions. Balancing issues of death, single parenthood, dual careers, scandal, parental issues, as well as hailing from two different countries, Rice brings home to her readers that any relationship requires commitment, work, dedication, honesty, and most of all love. I was endeared to this quote from the book, \\"That's what a married couple does . . .love each other through sickness and health, for richer, for poorer, in good times and bad. They love each other's children and try to honor each other's parents - even when the whole thing seems impossible.\\"Their marriage is tested, challenged and tested again and Rice's portrayal of a family ripped apart by the trials of life and past events is uncannily real. I could not put this latest bestseller down and was completely swept away and into the saga. I absolutely loved this book and Rice confirms once again, that only love is real. This is one book that will touch your heart and warm your soul - a definite keeper."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This is a very good book, but again (as with Rice's recent Firefly Beach) it's more of a lite sampling of the character depth that Luanne Rice has delivered so consistently so many times in the past. It's an engaging, original story of single mom wedding planner May raising her magical daughter Kylie and marrying charismatic but troubled hockey star Martin Cartier. Martin deals with the earlier tragic death of his own young daughter, Natalie, by repression and denial and is mired in unforgiveness towards his convict father, himself a hockey legend, for contributing to Natalie's death and for perpetrating other family betrayals.Rice weaves a fabric with many interesting threads - Kylie's magical prescience and angel friends, a wedding planner's enabling role in true love, the importance of childhood friends in the adult experience, the origin of sports rivalry in childhood disillusionments - but somehow the whole cloth of the book remains patchy, almost threadbare in spots. I never understood how Martin could be so closed-in emotionally for most of the story and still attract May, who overall impressed me with her own emotional maturity and self-awareness.As with all her books, she uses a few gripping, almost gruesome scenes to advance character exposition and plot. This is absolutely where Rice shines in her latest two books. While extending such intensity would probably make for too painful a read, I find myself wishing something in the story had lasted longer or had been explored to greater depth. That said, even a less than top rated Luanne Rice book will provide much more reading satisfaction than most of the 5 star reads out there."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"May Taylor, boarding the plane with her beloved six-year-old daughter Kylie, notices all the couples. May feels lonely in spite of her cherished daughter and she feels hurt because the child's father deserted them. Kylie begins talking with an angel that no one else can see. This frightens May who worries that her child is schizophrenic. However, that concern goes on the back burner when the plane makes an emergency landing. Hockey superstar Martin Cartier helps mother and daughter jump down the slide.He wonders how Kylie knew trouble was coming because she had stopped to ask him to help her on her way back from the restroom. Kylie says that his daughter told her, but Martin knows his child is dead. Still Martin feels a bond with Kylie and an attraction to May, but his personal life is filled with tragedy and sadness while May has little faith in men and in her daughter's clairvoyant abilities. Only a loving child with the help of angels could turn this duo into a couple, but that may prove too big a mission.SUMMER LIGHT is a fabulous relationship drama that uses the paranormal to focus on lonely people. The story line is beautiful as Martin and May struggle with attraction and love while worrying about Kylie's mental health. The paranormal not only feels real and right, it helps propel the plot and provide understanding to the lead trio. Fans of contemporary romance with a dash of the paranormal will find Luanne Rice's latest novel a poignant, interesting, and entertaining tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This was my first book by this author. I really thought it could have been interesting, but it just ended up boring. The main character, May, seems so indecisive. Kind of a doormat, really. You never really get to know her at all. The story of how these two meet and fall in love is just too unbelievable. I mean they barely had a conversation, and next thing they were getting married. (A wedding that excludes almost every important person in the bride's life, for some reason.) I was kind of bothered by Martin, every time he gets mad at someone, he just stomps off. And I never got why May keeps nagging him about his father. I ended up skipping to the end of the book just to get it over with."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This is one of Luanne Rice's best. If you have never read Rice before, or tried to read her before,(say, Cloud Nine-Dream Country) but couldn't, &quot;Summer Light&quot; is a very fast paced novel and better than her previous works. I had to force myself to put it down. I don't always like to finish a novel in one sitting, but I could have with this.There were several times when I was near tears, which doesn't always happen when I read romances.The themes of forgiveness, miracles, and lots of medical terminology running through this novel, as one of the main characters, Hockey player, Martin Cartier, is going blind--very sad and tragic, as he tries to wield a hockey puck but can't see. Martin Cartier needs a miracle, and he just might have found it in his love interest, May Taylor, and her &quot;psychic&quot; daughter, 6-year-old, Kylie.Luanne Rice is a very emotional writer, more emotional than intellectual. The writing isn't as thought-provoking as it is emotion-feeling provoking. But this is what most romance readers want: writing that makes you feel, rather than think. Although, out of all the romance writers, Luanne Rice (along with Barbara Delinsky and Nicholas Sparks) is the most intelligent and realistic.If you liked Barbara Delinskys &quot;Lake News&quot; or Nicholas Sparks &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; then you would like &quot;Summer Light&quot;.So, on to Luanne Rice's &quot;Firefly Beach&quot;, as I am looking forward to reading a lot more by this author."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Having read a few of Ms. Rice's other novels, I was looking forward to this one, not the least because it was partly set in a part of Canada that I know very well.The story itself was not up to Ms. Rice's usual standards: the plot seemed contrived and the characters lacked credibility. More irritating, however, was the author's shoddy research. Ms. Rice's descriptions of hockey games were laughable, and her descriptions of the setting were downright ludicrous. Ms. Rice should stick to writing about topics she knows and understands, or make sure she is writing about fictitious places."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I can't believe all the readers who find this an amazing read or get up early to finish reading this book! Yes, I stuck it out and finished the book, but to think this was one of the best books to read,YIKES. You really need to read a lot more if this is one of the best. It is sappy, boring, predictable and totally unbelievable. Yeah right, owls in a bridal shop. A hockey player who is so \\"in love\\", with a character like May. Really? Only in a silly story like this. Sorry, I just don't buy it. I'd rather read Cinderella again!"},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I probably have a chapter left to go and i can't wait for this book to be over. I get no pleasure out of the the main characters, I wouldn't want them as friends and I really wish they had more of a sense of humor. I don't get why Martin and May got together in the first place and why they felt they had to get married a few weeks after meeting. I couldn't find anything they had in common. I'm irritated by May's constant harping about Martin's father when it's absolutely clear Martin has good reasons for feeling the way he does.Spoiler -- Martin comes home late at night after a bruising hockey game and a three-hour drive to be with May and the first thing she does is talk about reconciling with his estranged father. When he says he needs to rest, she doggedly pursues the topic. What? What kind of spouse does that? I don't blame him for leaving either. In fact, I wish he'd never come back and then the book would be over."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This was my first time reading Luanne Rice, and I must admit I wanted to read the book mostly for the hockey storyline. I was, unfortunately, very disappointed and couldn't even finish the book. The storyline was not believable. I had a hard time with May constantly staying after Martin to talk about Natalie and his father, and I couldn't figure out why she could not seem to understand why he was so upset with his father. I never got a sense of a great love between this couple either - there was nothing that made me really believe that they really were passionate about one another or had any &quot;sparks&quot; between them. I didn't really dislike either character, but they did not seem to fit one another. I also found some of the hockey aspects of the book to unbelievable - I won't get into details, but suffice it to say I wondered if there were any other players on the Bruins team or just Martin? The whole thing was just so sickly sweet that I couldn't stomach it."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"This book was one of those that inspires one to want to write. The ability of miss Rice to capture life and put in on paper. This book in particular. It was well written technically but even better emotionally. She captured the emotions of the characters an dforces the reader to feel tham too. The characters them selves are vivid and come to life on the page. I for one could hardly put it down in the day it took me to read it."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Luanne rice wrote the first romantic novel I ever read and every book i have read since the first has been exeptional. This latest effort on her part displays the same knowledge of how to make the reader feel the emotions in the book.

Despite that the basic story is unique and i for one couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"If you are thinking of reading this book my advise would be, DON'T. I listened to the unabridged audio tape and have stayed till the &quot;bitter&quot; end. If I had been reading the book I would have given up on page 50. All the characters are so sweet &quot;sugar wouldn't melt in their mouths&quot; that is except for the &quot;revenge seeking hocky player&quot;. The only word that comes to mind to describe this book is &quot;sappy&quot;."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"Within the first dozen pages, the author tells the reader that the child is special, that May Taylor's female ancestors have magic, that Martin is rugged handsome etc. There are no revelations, no suspense, no surprises. May's conversations with her friend Tobin are so banal that they hardly advance the plot or develop characters. May herself doesn't really have a personality, the author TELLS us that things happened to May or May has feelings. I was disappointed in this book, based on the glowing reviews."},{"Title":"Summer Light","review":"I think the book was quite good, however, being a hockey fan I picked up on something. On p53 Luanne says Game 3 also went into overtime, and this time the Oilers won it 2-0. I have discussed this with many people and I don't think it is possible to win a game 2-0 in overtime. The win would be 1-0. I do get upset when authors don't research or have professionals check their work. I can't find an e-mail anywhere for Ms Rice so I am stating my comments here."},{"Title":"Licensed Varieties of Potatoes","review":"This is a must-own book for anyone interested in the licensed varieties of potatoes.

His pages are populated by poems that explore faith, death, identity (especially Jewishness), and the nature of human existence. Each poem is both lament and celebration of life and love and loss. Poems like &quot;Hobart Street&quot; touch the reader with images human frailty and desire. Other poems such as &quot;Loss,&quot; &quot;Without Allusion,&quot; and &quot;Extraction&quot; are virtually prayers. Amazing line follows amazing line as Lieberman shapes the words into verse that writhes with life. Though occasionally the medical and scientific terminology (Lieberman is also a research pathologist) can be challenging for the layman, it added a rich texture to the copious detail. These poems are proof that Michael Lieberman is paying attention to the wonder of existence. It is a book I am glad to own."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"Ok: I don't read a lot of books, but I love dogs and even-more-so for German Shepherds.

The love and admiration that she had for this breed of dog shine through the pages of this book."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"This book is full of lots of information from a very knowledgable source.Something about the book, though, didn't grab my attention. I found it tedious to read.For the most part it focuses on showing dogs, picking out a future \\"champion\\" (i.e. show champion) vs. one that will be \\"just a pet.\\" The book is full of these little lines about if you're not up to the true and most valuable function of a GSD, showing, then some hastily drawn up line of advice will suffice for you at the end of a paragraph or chapter.Service and schutzhund are treated much the same way. I opened this thick book expecting many great stories of dogs of war, rescue, service, obedience, etc. but only got bits of a few stories with one or two black and white photos.I suppose if the author made it a point to outline her bias toward the show ring, I might have found the book a little more palatable, but I had to force myself through page after page that felt like being talked down to to get the information I wanted.I would have probably been happy with a shorter text that was a little more general and balanced. Perhaps the author can just change the name of the book to \\"The GSD as a show dog\\" or something like that, because the info on the dog for that purpose really is great.I don't regret owning this book, but it does NOT work as the one and only GSD book to own."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"I recommend this book to any GSD owner or interested person. It is a great reference book. I have been into German Shepherds 30 years and I still enjoy reading it. It has a wealth of information on German and American lines. It takes you from feeding and socializing a young pup to the caring for your old friend. Learn to read a pedigree, treat your dog for illness, teach him good manners. It's a &quot;everything you wanted to know about shepherds but didn't know where to look all in one book&quot;. On the negative side, there are numerous pictures but unfortunatly none in color. I would love to see the different coat colors, ie: sables, black/reds, bi-colored, blacks, whites, and greys. I would also like to see more info on shepherds used for other than conformation or obedience but as service dogs, agility, personal protection, Schutzhund, working, herding, search and rescue, to name a few, as well as how are they used in other countries with accompaning pictures. When all is said and done, this is still a great book, full of information and pictures you won't find elsewhere. Keep it close at hand, you'll be referring to it again and again."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"I am an avid fan of the German Shepherd dog and have a small library of books on the breed. This book holds a place of honor at the top of the stack as one of the most complete breed books I have found. It appears to be an honest appraisal and history of the breed, but with the obvious prejudice of an owner. Her love of her dogs shines through in amost every page. That can easily be fogive. The comparison of the German and American lines is particularly helpful. Ms Strickland's knowledge of the breed and many years of experience are well known and add to the credibility of her work. Good job, we look forward to the next update."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"This book doesn't just cover everything about the GermanShepherd Dog that you need to know, it covers it thoroughly andintelligently. In it's THIRD edition it includes all the most current champions here and in Germany. It is as important to the new GSD owner wondering how to raise his new puppy as to the seasoned breeder for research. It even covers training and Winifred Strickland's dog training techniques are classic and will never be 'dated.' Her dogs were top obedience trial champions in the fifties and they are top obedience trail champions today. You cannot do better than to take her advice.It is a mystery why the publisher hasn't put in color photos, when other rather useless 'fluff' books get color photos to sell them to the public. This fine book should be color.But it is way ahead of all the rest in it's content and it is lavishly illustrated with black and white photographs. It is the best out there."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"Strickland and Moses did it again. There first book was excelent and the second is too. The most important aspect of this book is the rasing and care of the GSD and the history of the GSD. The structural drawings are supper along with all of the photos. This book shows what a GSD and what has been done in the past. The history of the German and American lines and their differences are helpful too. I would recomend this book to anybody who owns a GSD or is thinking of owning a GSD."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"With its information on the earliest history of the breed to the famous German Shepherds today, this is *the* book to add to your library! It contains a wealth of information and beautiful pictures of famous German Shepherds both in Germany and abroad.I can find only two downsides to this book. First, the section on selecting a puppy, though informative, is more geared to the potential breeder than to the pet owner. Second, I wish that the section on Schutzhund trials would have included a description of the tests that the dogs must pass.Overall, I highly recommend this book. If you want to purchase only one book on the breed, you can't go wrong with this one. Clearly, it was written by people who absolutely love and respect the breed."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"This is an excellent book recommended to me by my dogs breeder. I have read just about all of the GSD books written in the English language (available in my country) and this one is the most complete. She is good at discussing the differences between the German lines and American lines in such a way to be very non biased! Amazing... did not think it could be done. It walks you through the basics right through the more complex aspects of the German Shepherd world. Good stuff! Not just a must read but a must own!!"},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"If you ever wanted to buy one book for learning about GSD's, THIS is it. This book teaches you everything you want to know. Those who want to go further into breeding GSD's would also find this book very informative. My GSD's were growing like Sausage dogs and I went against my stupid vet's nutritional advice and followed the nutritional advice in this book. My GSD's are now about the best built dogs in the neighbourhood...what true GSD's should look like. The Authors should write more books like this. A MUST BUY book!"},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"I have learned more about all aspects of German Shepherd Dogs from this book than from any other. Anyone wanting to know about this marvelous breed would not be disappointed in the least at buying this book. Whether you own a pet or a champion, this book is filled with facts, training tips, and wonderful photographs of both American-bred and German-bred champions. Winifred Stickland and James Moses have done a great justice to the breed with this book. It is well written and an easy read for both the novice and the expert shepherd owner. The photographs are good, yet I agree with the other review that the thing that would make this book one step better would be to use color photo's instead of black and white where possible. A highly recommended book--you can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"The German Shepherd Today copyrighr 1974.I raised and trained a wonderful, intelligent, obedient,GS by the name of Major and this book guided me through two rigid years of training for a dog that turned out to be everything that you would want in a pet. From a puppy to an adult the book takes you step by step in raising a very large dog and guiding him to be well manered and obediant. This well written book is right on target in giving the proper guidence."},{"Title":"The German Shepherd Today (Dog Breed Books)","review":"As a first-time GSD owner, this was the second book I purchased and read about the breed. While much of the information was useful, I was also left with many questions.I disagree with the harsh training methods outlined in this book. Not only did my puppy not learn from them, but they left her with issues that needed to be resolved before she could learn anything else effectively. Also, the health section left a bit to be desired.All of the information that I considered to be helpful has been found in many other publications. As an all-encompassing book it's okay, but I'd just as soon get my money back and spend it on two or three other books -- I'd get more useful information that way."},{"Title":"Up From Here: Reclaiming the Male Spirit: A Guide to Transforming Emotions into Power and Freedom","review":"\\"Terror will kill you\\", that was the statement that caught my attention at the beginning of the book. Mrs Vanzant has hit the 'nail on the head' when it comes down to analyzing male emotions.I was once, one of those men who lived in fear like her characters, Roy, Phillip and Gabriel who refused to connect with pain and reality. Through our past actions we had dishonored ourselves and couldn't find a way to comfort our pain without feeling guilty, blaming and condemmed.This book will guide many men into healing and awareness. If we take the time to recall our faults and own up to them, redemption is available.Lastly, \\"Fear is like a growling dog that has you pinned to a wall. When you move, it growls louder.\\"Thank you Mrs Vanzant for your insight and wisdom.Author, M.W.Moore"},{"Title":"Up From Here: Reclaiming the Male Spirit: A Guide to Transforming Emotions into Power and Freedom","review":"Up From Here: Reclaiming The Male Spirit by inspirational author Iyanla Vanzant is a &quot;user friendly&quot; self-help guide for men to embrace and take advantage of the strengths and spiritual essence of masculinity. From rising above painful negative emotions of shame, fear, and anger, to overcoming personal demons, to embracing personal stories and finding true inner strength, Up From Here is insightful, thoughtful, and highly recommended guide for men seeking to transform their emotions into spiritual power and personal freedom."},{"Title":"Up From Here: Reclaiming the Male Spirit: A Guide to Transforming Emotions into Power and Freedom","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I picked up a book about the male spirit written by a woman, but I had read some of Iyanla Vanzant's other works and was impressed. Having read it, I'm really impressed: Iyanla knows her stuff! I recommend this book for any man who's struggling in his life, or anyone who knows a man who's struggling and wants to understand, maybe even to forgive.The book is organized into anecdotes, each one describing a guy going off the rails in his life, then clarifying why and how it happpened, what he could have done about it, and what he can do about it now. There are seven anecdotes in all, and I saw something of myself in all but one of them. Each section suggests \\"power tools\\" usable for us to regain a sense of control over a situation, which allows a reader to counteract less productive patterns in his life.If there's anything missing from this book, it's a bit more detail on applying the strategies more globally. I ended up referring to other books to find out more about achieving stillness, and what exactly \\"living by spiritual laws\\" meant to Iyanla. This is best used as a companion book to her other material, I especially suggest \\"In the Meantime,\\" \\"Living Through the Meantime,\\" and \\"One Day My Soul Just Opened Up.\\" Definitely make these core books a priority, but \\"Up From Here\\" is a gem not to be overlooked either!"},{"Title":"Where is Elmo's Blanket?

The only downside to this book is my particular copy.

He didn't really seem to interested at first, but then he caught on after awhile. Storytime before bedtime for the last month now consists of us holding him in our lap while he lifts open every single flap in the book and turns the pages back and forth.Some of the flaps are rather small and may be hard for them to find/open when the book is pressed down after being closed and the flaps are flattened back into its space. Not easy for little fingers to dig out the flap but it doesn't seem to bother him at this point because he just goes to the flaps that are sticking out enough to see. Not sure if this will be an issue as he gets older, but I'm sure his motor skills will be capable of taking care of this issue.It's a well made book and has held up pretty well after over a month's use of \\"reading\\" it every night and lifting up each of the 40-something flaps multiple times each night.I bought another Elmo flap book for when we go traveling!"},{"Title":"Where is Elmo's Blanket?

I will agree with the other reviews, though, the book is more flimsy cardboard than other traditional board books and the flaps are definitely in danger of being ripped off.

It has all the favorite characters in funny scenarios with pages that have many different and fun things to look at, and my daughter loves lifting the flaps and finding out what's inside -- over and over (thank God!!).

Even though he's had this book for more than 2 months now, if he even glimpses the cover he'll still smile and clap in excitement.He loves to look at all of the pictures, which include drawings of most of his Sesame Street friends. He likes to lift the pop-up flaps himself, but will get frustrated if they are difficult to lift (something any parent should bear in mind, unless your child has long fingernails!), so I help him if necessary.Really, I think the only downside of this book is that there's very little language. Granted, a very young child isn't ready for tons of paragraphs on a page, but I thought this book could probably fit in a few more sentences per page and still hold a small child's interest.That being said, I still recommend this book. It's a cute story, and the many details in each picture mean that a child will notice new things each time he/she reads it."},{"Title":"Where is Elmo's Blanket?

Teenagers, the most gossiped-about, the most storied, envied, disliked, discriminated against, and misunderstood group of all modern western humans, finally have a book of their own that is sympathetic to their cause. (Although I doubt few will ever read it.) Palladino cites the social injustices teens face, reminds us how short a time the word \\"teenager\\" has been in our cultural lexicon, and studies the way teens have thought, spoken, acted, and influenced popular society throughout time. This is an unexpectedly scholarly yet interesting book that takes the time to go out on a limb and side with the rebellious youth among us, and also to speculate on how the teen years are changing and how they might ultimately be in the near future. I liked Teenagers: An American History well enough to buy a copy after I'd finished the one I happened to get from the local library."},{"Title":"Teenagers: An American History","review":"I am teaching a course on the history of youth this semester. I read Palladino's entertaining book when considering adopting it for my course. In the end, I passed on the book because of some sloppy research in the first chapter. For example, Palladino begins her book by telling the story of Alfred Fondler (age 23) a man who slapped \\"a teenage girl\\" at a movie theater. Palladino uses this narrative to stake out major themes of her book: the changing cultural meaning of \\"teenager\\" and youth culture and resistance. Yet, the facts are fudged in her opening anecdote. The woman in question who was slapped--Margaret Schultz--was 24 years old, a year older than her assailant. The newspaper articles that describe Schultz as a \\"girl\\" do so because adult women were often infantalized. Violence against Schultz, moreover, was sanctioned not because Schultz was young but because she was female.Because a casual fact checking of Palladino's first footnote reveal this kind of error, I worried about what a more careful analysis would find. In the end, I used a series of articles.I hope a second edition of this book will have more careful fact checking because this text has a lot of promise and will be a valuable resource for students."},{"Title":"The Nightclerk: Being His Perfectly True Confession","review":"Schneck was a member of Anton LaVey's Magic Circle, then the Church of Satan.

Edward McGhee and Robin Moore in THE CHINESE ULTIMATUM tell of a world of tough-talking military men bashing their fists on a huge oaken table as they bark their orders to properly subservient lessers. Battles are described in all their gore just as if the reader were right there getting drenched in a carmine blanket. And women exist solely as eye candy for powerful men.The plot is surprisingly intricate. A pre-unified Germany stages a coup, routing the Russian soldiers from a post-Nazi Germany so that Germany stands again as one nation. The Russian Premier, Kharkov, is foaming angry, and to complicate matters, he learns that the only reason the Germans had the nerve to unite their country was a secret deal that the Germans made with the Chinese. The German act was to be only the preliminary surprise assault by the Chinese against Russia. Kharkov feels that he has no choice but to launch a pre-emptive strike. He places the venerable Marshal Korzybski in charge of the attack. Korzybski was a graduate of the cordite and bullet school of war, an education bloodily learned at Stalingrad and Moscow. His plan is simple: a good defense means a better offense. He is quite willing to shed as many casualties as necessary to smash the Chinese threat for ever. His reckless attitude worries Kharkov, who correctly recognizes that the Chinese can afford monstrous losses that the Russians cannot. Ultimately, he is forced to replace Korzybski with a more conservative general. The war between the two countries is inconclusive, and by the novel's end an uneasy bloody status quo is reached.The charm of the novel is distinctly masculine. The battle scenes are replete with guns shooting, shells landing, and individual soldiers on both sides performing heroically. The switch in scene from one sector of battle to another recreates the confusion that must reign on such a battlefield. What McGhee and Moore make abundantly clear is that modern war involves masses of troops smashing into each other in a manner not unlike the Crusaders bullying their way through massed Moslem ranks of the tenth century. Men die by the scores of thousands in such warfare. The lesson that McGhee and Moore teach us is that war is bloody and chaotic, and if any modern leader of any country forgets that, then reading THE CHINESE ULTIMATUM may prevent in real life what was only described in print."},{"Title":"The Chinese Ultimatum","review":"We found our copy of \\"The Chinese Ultimatum\\" in a dusty corner of the attic (okay, not so dusty) with what appeared to be a bookstore receipt from 1977. The idea of reading some forgotten relic is always an appealing come-on for us at The Rotten Review - promising retro-thrills and (in the case of the 1970's) really, really bad sex. In neither respect did \\"Ultimatum\\" leave us hungry, but perhaps there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.\\"Ultimatum\\" can be boiled down to the story of a massive Chinese/Soviet war and the myriad geopolitical shifts that war causes. The story is played out in the halls of the White House, the killing fields of the Far East and behind closed doors of other power brokers. When China and the Soviet Union are on the verge of another war (that others have been fought is only one of several salient geopolitical points that set the world of \\"Ultimatum\\" apart from our own), the Soviets throw everything they have into the mix, stripping their armies in Europe to supply the massed force arrayed against massed waves of Chinese troops. The Russians have technology on their side, while the PRoC has numbers and shorter lines of communication. Being closer to home has its advantages, and the Russians aren't the odds-on favorite to come out of the war. Sensing that the time is right, the Soviets' satellites in Europe sense the time is ripe for escape. Though some (Bulgaria) remain steadfast in support of the Soviet bloc, other client states appear to have planned in ahead for this very set of circumstances. With the Soviets facing military disaster in the east and secession in Europe, the rest of the world wonders at how far Moscow will go without resorting to the nuclear option. In the White House, the president grills his staff and his generals about the state of the war and how to navigate America through the international upheavals spreading from it.\\"Ultimatum\\" was a fun book, but eventually you may find yourself tiring of its formula - scenes in which characters discuss international events, enjoy sexual favors, enjoy fine foods, fight major armored battles and start the whole thing over again. Also, the authors throw so many changes in the shape of national borders and politics that you soon realize that anything is possible - as opposed to the real world where some limits are expected - and \\"Ultimatum\\" begins to look like a plausible vision of our own world than some other world that shares many of the same names.It's best if you enjoy \\"Ultimatum\\" as a symbol of its times (though also a possible warning to present day America). Seen through that prism, the battle scenes are especially satisfying, and it's easier to laugh at the cheap sex scenes and the way that the authors concentrate on minutiae of high-priced cuisine as the rest of the world falls around them.For an even better retro-70's novel, check out Erdman's \\"Last Days of America\\"."},{"Title":"The Chinese Ultimatum","review":"The previous reviewer was spot on. I will just flesh out the plot. It is in a time of American decline and it is postulated that our NATO commitment is down to a corps or so and everyone else accordingly as Russian attention gets diverted east to China. The Russians and Chinese go at it along the Amur River in Siberia. The Germans launch a reunification coup, ousting NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The Russians cut a deal with them, splitting Poland up while a bloody stalemate ensues in Siberia. The Russians win some early battles but find themselves bogged down in a war of attrition against a billion plus Chinese. The Israelis run wild in the Mideast, securing a Phoenician type empire from Tripoli to Damascus! Yes, folks, it's a pretty alternate universe.

Sweet, sad, poignant, artful, tripped out, spacey in the best way, touching, sexy, signifigant."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"'Try' is my first Dennis Cooper book and, well, it will probably be my last as well. I read it because I thought it would be quality 'shock' literature similar to the works of JG Ballard, Chuck Palahniuk or Irvine Welsh. While 'Try' is chock-full of shock elements I'm afraid I couldn't understand what Dennis Cooper was trying to say. I hoped to be rewarded after enduring pages of serious S&amp;M verbage. But instead the book simply left me confused, and relieved (that I finished it).In a nutshell, 'Try' is about a teenager (Ziggy) who is systematically abused both physically and sexually by his two dads. He also is in love with a straight junkie, and has an uncle who perhaps should have specialized as a proctologist for young boys. Ziggy's world is a nightmare but, inexplicably, he takes it in stride. He goes as far as writing a newsletter for sexually abused kids. Suffice to say, while some elements of the story are plausible I found 'Try', on the whole, to be over-the-top.'Try' is an extremely graphic novel. Even fetish-oriented gay men would probably be amazed (to the point of ecstasy) at the lurid descriptions of rough sexual acts. This book is definitely not for the squeamish.However I will credit Dennis Cooper for at least being a 'good writer' (ie, his narrative flows well), and for at least 'pushing the envelope' in the sometimes stodgy world of literature. He seems to have the talent to produce fine work. However he did not achieve this with 'Try'."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"Have Placebo read dennis Cooper? has Cooper heard Placebo (bet he has - they got a pretty bass-player!)Try is his best to date.

I had a very hard time getting through it. I actually put the book down several times, swearing I would not finish reading it. But I did want to know more about the main character, Ziggy. The subject matter is very dark and disturbing. I think what probably disturbed me most was the fact that someone had known enough about such deviant behaviors to write about them. The most difficult for me was reading about \\"Uncle Ken\\", a disgusting, overweight, child molester/pornographer. He truly made me feel sick to my stomach. But in the end, I did finish the book, which is why I gave it three stars. It's somewhat interesting if your can stomach it."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

Give Dennis Cooper a, well, try."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"this is definitely my favorite of the 5-book series (frisk, try, guide, closer, period) that Cooper penned. i had admired his work from afar because for the longest time his choice of subject matter and deadpan prose often made me feel estranged from the characters and their situations. however, there is something to be said for his work as it has managed to attain a certain kind of distinguishment in my eyes which is perhaps an entirely personal sentiment, although a case could be made that it's not entirely personal. but i won't try.about the book: it is one of the most &quot;emotional&quot; of the 5-book series and has some of the most haunting passages and easy-to-identify characters (as far as the characters in Cooper's universe are concerned anyway!): the abusive father, the tragically misunderstood young man, the twisted relative, the aloof and obsessed admirer, and the suicidal compatriot. while there are a few other minor characters the above named are the most poignant and fully fleshed out (the aloof and obsessed admirer is narrated in the first-person) it helps to better understand just how difficult it is for the central character to relate to anyone, to understand their motives and situations, and ultimately to foresee any consequences. there is less of a recklessness in Cooper's storytelling with this novel and has perhaps the most optimistic &quot;protagonist&quot; of all the novels. this is saying a lot considering one of the story's more gruesome happenings, which is told in chillingly minimal language. in spite of these twists and turns in character development and plot cohesiveness the story reads fairly easy (if you're accustomed to Cooper's work) and is perhaps one of the most easily accessible as far as characterization and emotional depth go. but be warned, Cooper's writing has been and always will be for mature audiences only."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"There are a few cliches to get your head round before reading Cooper and taking him seriously. One is the idea of the countercultural writer or punk poet. He is both of these, to an extent, but nothing like exclusively. If he borrows weight from any quarter it's in that he's gay and tackling the very established, even passe form of the pychological novel (see that blurb about Austen on the jacket). Anyone who knows Genet, though, will see the influence straight away - a writer besotted with the erotic and mythopoeic property of words, while staying far from any traditional level of erudition that could be used to boost his reputation or advance an idea of his 'level'. He is, in fact, a perfect modern incarnation of (or caterer to) Baudelaire's 'hypocrite lecteur'. He's 1% artist, and his books are 1% art, but don't underestimate that fraction's potency. Writes from the heart like no-one i know."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"First I was confused: Was this a novel about gay adoption - promoting child pornography - necrophilia - abuse - abuse - abuse and drugs - trying to find something funny in all that - which would be awful and deserve a rating below zero.......but then I realised what the author is trying to do: he shows us how it happens and how people deal with it. Complete and utter madness has become the normal daily life for Ziggy and the others in this novel and they survive somehow. Ziggy abused by his to adoptive fathers writes a magazine about abuse and goes so far as to interview his uncle (a child pornographer) and his victim during the act - a scene which would be extremely funny if it wasn't so ugly.In all of this the author succeeds somehow to include a sensitive love story as well - an unlikely one between Ziggy the probably-gay-but-not-sure-about-anything abused young guy and his friend the young writer Calhoun - a heroin addict and manages a quasi happy ending - which of course will not last.I gave it 7 out of 10 but the book is really unrateable - it is well written on the whole but might be misunderstood.Read it if you like controversial stuff."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"One of the warmest stories of friendship I've ever had the honor to read.Yes, it's edgy.Yes, it's sexual.But, when you get right down to it, it's about the love and friendship between these two boys.I must say, I was shocked by one scene in the book.

Although well-written, it seems like an exercise in writing about sexual abuse, violence and drugs with the sole purpose of being as nihilistic and shocking as possible. I found no theme or message from the work, nor did I experience any feelings for any of the characters. Cooper should bring his talent to bear on more worthwhile efforts."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"A friend recommended this book. Here is what he said, &quot;Cooper attempts to find beauty in the profane.&quot; Simple, isn't it? To say the least this is a pretty good book for one written in the language of a 5th grader. But it is not an imporatant book for the very reason that Cooper is not trying (not hard enough) to write an important book (his critics would lead you to believe otherwise). All in all, if you want to see what American writers are doing today (and this book is typical in many respects), this is a quick read. But be prepared! His subjects include body mutilations, incest with dead boys, child pornography, and domestic rape -- amoung other things. If you just want a taste of these things, Cooper may satisfy you . . . or &quot;whatever&quot; (Cooper's favorite word)."},{"Title":"Try.","review":"This is my first Dennis Cooper book so it took me several pages to get use to his style of writing.

This book will likely be appreciated by those who are thinking about, are attending, or have already attended one of the institutions in this book. But some may find it quite interesting to read about Harvard Law students, and how the school is different from what many would imagine it to be -- like who knew that some third year Harvard Law students don't attend classes?I'd recommend this book specifically for those who are planning to apply to those top law schools. For everyone else, you might want to check your local library or bookstore before you purchase this item (as you'll likely skim or read only the school you are interested in).** Note: Although the book was published over a decade ago, I found most of the material still relevant.

It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle.

So I had to resort to the usual CDs. This revealed an immediate shortcoming with Tantor's version. Although the announcements as to the current book, volume, and section on LibriVox are tiresome, you know where you are. Tantor's edition contains absolutely no index or printed table of contents for a 29 CD set. The current location is neither announced at the beginning of each CD, nor printed anywhere on the CD. So if you were reading the book and want to listen to the rest on audiobook, you have to listen to the whole thing from the beginning. :(The reader has a nice accent though. He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion.

Science)","review":"The greek tradition found virtue in the pursuit of rational self interest. That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers. I rather think that \\"mankind\\" is neither entirely selfish or entirely selfless.The truth is most likely found in the middle. The work of mathematician John Nash, celebrated of late in the motion picture \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", wrote a brilliant paper on \\"binding agreements\\" that casts grave doubts upon many \\"conservative\\" fables, shibboleths, and fairy tales --including those whose origins lie in \\"mutually exclusive\\" intellectual traditions.

Science)","review":"This book has two massive and core problems, each one of them large enough to make this book incredibly, even dangerously, misleading.The first problem of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is not to be found in identifying all those familiar, and illogical anomalies that have been proven through experience false, and are well known (the \\"invisible hand\\" and others); nor the fact that Smith completely hides the history of his own country (how after the English civil war the English pursued an incredibly protectionist series of policies); but that all these complaints can be seen as stemming from one underlying problem in Smith's analysis: which was almost exclusively that of a micro-economist. This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G.

Once the book itself starts, Canaan's input is non-invasive; I felt that he was sitting silently and attentively in the wings, like a stage director overseeing a play.* The original wording is preserved, augmented by explanatory conventional bottom-of-the-page footnotes. Cannan's edits (mostly to correct typos and make clarifications) are most welcome, and even the typographical errors are preserved verbatim in footnotes. An example of a clarification: the author's mention of a \\"fire-engine\\" had me thinking of a horse-drawn vehicle for putting out fires.

Forget Economics for a second: any general historian would be remiss without reading this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"Alfred North Whitehead famously stated that all of Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato. It seems to me one could say the same thing about economics in regard to Adam Smith. There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks.

Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context.

From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories.

Science)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"Adam Smith's \\"An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations\\" (often called simply \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\") is one of two great works from the Scottish economist and philosopher, the other being the lesser known \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\". \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\" was published on March 9th, of 1776, but there were additional editions in 1778, 1784, 1786, and 1789. I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

I was shopping specifically for a nice, inclusive, cloth edition of the classic text. The book is black cloth with a white and blue dust jacket and is between 9\\" and 10\\" tall. The text includes all five books of The Wealth of Nations, not splitting them up like some other editions do. Penguin splits it up into two physical books; the Bantam edition is only 7\\" tall and over 1200 pages long - not made to hold up to multiple reads. Not that I will be reading and re-reading the book right away, but a sturdy durable binding is well appreciated. Finally, Harriman House is a British publisher of business and financial titles; Americans will be unlikely to find this edition without special ordering through a venue like Amazon.

Having read it with great ignorance on the subject was able to learn a great deal about economic principles with more depth than \\"supply and demand dictate price\\". I found the ideas behind taxing to be simple but effective given their presentation as well as Smith's arguements for a free market economy. Reading this historical text has also helped placed into context his arguemnts against the mercantile system and the taxing of the American colonies because the depth that he goes into about said subjects is more than any history class that I have taken has allotted. For some the wording may seem dated or old or borring but for those who enjoy a more analytical style or writing, such as the style used in the translations of Roman philosophy texts, the writing style should not be a problem. The most intimidating aspect of this book is its size, an aspect which can easily be overcome if the reader finds the text engaging for the above reason. While I cannot say that it is a \\"must read\\" or a \\"required read\\" for an understanding of economics simply because of the ignorance which I still possess on the subject, I can say that it is an informative read that explains in depth, using cited examples, areas of economics that are easy to grasp if the reader enjoys the text. To conclude this, from my strictly ignorant (although less ignorant after reading this book) point of view, The Wealth of Nations is an informative and engaging book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

To minimize repetition, the differences for this version: This massive book is complete and unabridged (all five books). There is a great added feature in the form of small summary notes in the margin that accompany each paragraph. Adam Smith was a masterful writer of prose and communicates some of the most important economic and philosophical ideas in the history of western civilization. Economic theory never read so beautifully.An interesting choice for an introduction is Robert Reich. He is one of the few intellectuals from the left, and while I disagree with him more often than not, I respect his thought process. He offers his interpretation of Smith and how the ideas found in TWoN fit neatly with his positions. Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree. I just disagree with Reich and his ilk on how the \\"wealth\\" of the modern nation is achieved. Adam Smith offers the roadmap, but it is up to us to keep lawmakers in DC or [insert any central government here] from regulating and taxing us to death --relegating Smith's work to the dust bin."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is more readable than you probably think, and if you actually sit down to it you'll be repeatedly astounded by Smith's shrewdness.But parts of Smith's original can be tough going in many ways. Why don't publishers acknowledge this by coming out with something more helpful than just the raw text?Unfortunately, finding an edition that will be of great use to you is problematic. That's why I'm giving this book 1 star: not for the text itself, but rather for the paucity of well-done printings out there.Anyhow. I have three before me:1. The \\"Modern Library Classics\\" edition, the one you see on this page. This is complete and unabridged in a single volume, and has a handsome, sturdy feel to it. There is a 4-page introduction and a well-done index, but what irks about this edition is that while it has a plethora of footnotes, all the footnotes are of the \\"textual comparison\\" variety (e.g., \\"12 Car. II., C. 32\\"), rather than the kind that really help you understand antiquated terms and convoluted wordings. In other words, you'll get no help from the editors here.2. Then there is the barrenWealth of Nations (Great Minds Series). There is a 2-page introduction at the beginning and an index, but beyond that it's nothing more than the original text, complete with the original punctuation and spellings (neither of which has been made more merciful for the modern reader).3. The Penguin Classics edition, in two volumes:The Wealth of Nations: Books 1-3 (Penguin Classics)andThe Wealth of Nations, Books IV-V (Penguin Classics). This is probably the least worst edition I have seen, with a superb introduction (nearly 100 pages long), and a glossary, all done by Glasgow's Andrew Skinner. But the only footnotes in the text itself are apparently Smith's own. They appear directly on the bottom of the page in question.So good luck, whichever one you choose.In case you need to know, Smith's original consists of five long chapters, or \\"books.\\"If anybody has a more respectable edition at hand, please comment and I'll incorporate it into this review."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"To be an economist without having read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is like being a priest without having read the Bible. As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14! Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece). Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work. Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work. Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.AMMENDMENT:Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once). I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Why, you ask?It's out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, a great many from Print on Demand Publishers and there are some truely awful reprints available. Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of low-quality Print-On-Demand Publishers who are specialise in reprinting copyright-expired books. Such as \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" published by General Books LLC. This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.Lest you doubt, here's some word for word quotes from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....\\"\\"Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision as General Books LLC are all poor quality, tiny (almost unreadable) fonts and they don't bother to reproduce little things like Table of Contents or Indexes.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another version of the book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

He explained that all work had to behighly organized in order to be productive. In addition, herecognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion servesas an important foundation for more modern patent practice.He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of newmachinery. The author spoke of increased production as acondition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From thisprecept, he explained that the size of a market would dictatethe division of its constituent labor. For instance, a smallcommunity in the suburbs might be serviced by a local&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would beserviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employeesand a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith'stime, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arrivingat a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing wasa function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labornecessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.For instance, the price of linen was a function of the laborof the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overallemployer. The natural price varied with the price of componentparts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronicappliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a functionof national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earnmore than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland whohad to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rateshovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The governmentcould borrow at 2% in Holland.Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:o the ease or hardship to do workConsider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting adiamond is a precise process which requires extensive trainingand expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was afunction of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanshipinvolved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.o the difficulty and expense of learning a tradeA skilled surgeon required years of medical training and along apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.o the constancy of employmento the trust reposed in the workpeopleConsider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacationto the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run theentire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trustreposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.o probability of success or failure of the ventureConsider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The tripwas lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagariesof nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take thesefactors into consideration.o the danger inherent in doing the workConsider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the takingof risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a singlecutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in lengthAdam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to thelandowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the pricein the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased thefertility of the land increased its value by implication.Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigerationdid not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until thefamous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineeringsciences.Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to thecountry of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised thevalue of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted businessand discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annualproduce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treatiesbetween countries helped local merchants to craft meaningfultrade sequences. Exports were encouraged . The expense oferecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on theland and the proportion of yield from the crops.Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to selloverseas in order to assist them in making a profit anddefraying costs/risks. This work is a classic in theoreticaland practical economics. It is a &quot;must read&quot; for economists,historians, majors in government, financiers, investors,literary buffs and a large constituency of academicians."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

It is worth reading, but for those with less time, I recommend \\"The Essential Adam Smith\\"The Essential Adam SmithContent Summary: The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" contains Adam Smith's classic defense of free trade, and his simultaneous attack on the mercantilist system of his day. Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them. My advice - we have much to learn from both Smith and Marx, if only critics would often read them before speaking too brashly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Unfortunately, much of the inspired and inspiring wisdom that Adam Smith toiled long to place in \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" has been edited out in this abridgment, to the point, at least in my opinion, where much of the real meat has been removed and much of what remains is merely milk, that is more appropriate for the simpler mind of a suckling child.Opting for an audio book, rather than taking the time to read the real thing, in and of itself is a significant compromise that forgoes the greater value of being able to pause and contemplate what you have read, and to then do whatever rereading is necessary in order to really evaluate and grasp what is being said.I realize that our lives are often so busy that we feel a legitimate need to make these kinds of compromises whenever we can. Although you can probably get away with a compromise like that with your recreational fiction, believe me, this is NOT the appropriate time or place to do that!

Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\".

Science)","review":"This is the best release of \\"Wealth of Nations\\" for several reasons. First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics. Yet, he describes Adam Smith as a far more balanced and complex thinker than his modern followers."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

We have come a long way. Now governments are simply inept including the USA government. When you compare the errors in governmental affairs that he reviewed more than two hundred years ago to the mistakes and wrong governmental policies of today there is considerable reason for optimism.What a damning review of governmental affairs he wrote. This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile. Why or how one decides to place Adam Smith in the conservative pile, is surely the sickness of political views over logic.

Science)","review":"Adam Smith, a professor of moral philosophy in 18th century Scotland, was, perhaps, the World's first &quot;economist.&quot; One must remember that during Smith's era, there simply was no such thing as the formal study of economics, and it is this fact that makes &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; so interesting as it represents the first attempt, as far as I know, by an individual to explain the intricacies of money, capitalism, profit, etc., in a scientific manner. Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"If you have any interest at all in Economics, you'll want to go to the source. This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start. There is so much good information here to be absorbed and pondered. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman. We highly recommend this seminal work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled.

Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself. It might be nice to hear the shouting from some one who has done some homework."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"For anyone coming to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations the first surprise is how readable it is. Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition.

If you think you'll get much from this book while lying on the beach or sitting on the toilet, maybe you should be looking at Grisham or People magazine instead :)"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"This book is surprisingly easy to understand, and Smith's insights apply to current issues of taxation, globalization, and the striving of special interests. Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines. A masterpiece not only of economics, but of prose as well."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"I was not impressed to find that this is an abridgement, especially considering that I found it by reading the reviews and could not discern it from the book cover at all. For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments. At the core of the room which is remaining for them, the Smith's suggestions still have urgent and actual importance.Sad thing to recognize that in XXIst century latin america, we need to read a great book from XVIIIst century to find out solutions."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

We could only see every newspaper and magazines are talking on how to stimulate the consumption to boost the GDP; or government officials announce to increase government expenditure to stimulate the economy. It seems that the only question to economic growth depends on how much we spend. But if it is true, do it imply that we could be wealthy by just spend and spend and without further work?It is only after reading the first sentence of the book I remember the only truth that seems also to be forgotten by many people: it is only our labour that determine the wealth of nations, and also yourself. The book use a lot of illustrations to show how the division of labour could increase the production and it is on our self-interest to make exchange that give rise to division of labour, the theme that has mentioned by other reviewers and books.You should have read a lot of quotations from the book but you could not understand fully the central theme of the book by just few sentences.

As the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy, Smith keenly perceived the theoretical framework for its future development: property rights, markets, free trade, and government non-intervention.

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures.

Science)","review":"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations brilliantly analyzes how a nation's living standards can be raised. In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above. Then look in the index to find reference to the &quot;invisible hand&quot; &quot;monopoly&quot; &quot;colonies&quot; and other subjects of interest.Buy the GLASGOW EDITION of the Wealth of Nations.

(To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia. Hiswords facilitate skimming, something most readers ofthis thousand page book are apt to do. His words andphrases are also easily ignored. They don't get in yourway once you've found the pages you want to read.(Reviewer T. Grimes comments on the marginalia aswell.)Finally, reading The Wealth of Nations shows Smith tobe different from his usual portrayal. He can bewickedly satirical. Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity. But later (pp. 839-41 in my ModernLibrary edition), he recognizes the destructive effectsof division of labor and, in response, recommendsgovernment investment in public education.

Science)","review":"This book is a modeling exercise about the components of a nation's wealth, whereby: Wealth of Nations = Land + Labour + Stock (ie Capital accumulated). This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist.

It is a fairly aggressive book based on its size with almost 1,000 pages of fairly fine print of which half of it is dedicated to the supply and demand of corn. But it is surprisingly readable and even interesting. And it is the basic textbook of all economics.Wealth is defined as production capability or what we might call GDP.I figure with a changing economy, it never hurts to brush up on the basics. We are in a period of sharp changes in supply and demand. It is important for business leaders to try to understand what impact this will have on them and their companies.One principle that Adam espouses is the division of labour.He also talks about principals, those are the people that supply the capital that is put to use by the agents (people who apply the capital). His view is that people should not do both, they should do one or the other.

Science)","review":"The simple points upon which this book is based might be much easier to understand today than when it was written, because a large part of the growth of the world economy has been based on the ideas about the growth of capital which this book assumed as the fundamental surplus value of economic activity. Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it.

Science)","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" has led U.S. trade policy for decades, if not longer. Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

He also wroteThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. This book was first published in 1776, interestingly enough.Smith noted in the \\"Plan of Work\\" that prefaces the book that among the \\"savage nations of hunters,\\" the people are often \\"miserably poor\\"; while among civilized and thriving nations, \\"a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order... may enjoy a greater share of the necessities and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\\" The First Book addresses the \\"causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour,\\" while the Second Book treats \\"of the nature of capital stock, or the manner in which it is gradually accumulated\\"; the Third Book deals with the circumstances regarding the establishment of towns, rather than of the country; and the Fourth Book deals with various theories of political economy.He begins the book with the observation that \\"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour... seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.\\" He cites the example of pin manufacturing, in which a single man could perhaps make one pin a day, \\"and certainly could not make twenty.\\" But by ten persons dividing the labor, they are able to make 48,000 pins in a single day. (Pg. 3-5)He frankly acknowledges that \\"masters\\" (i.e., employers) are \\"always and every where\\" in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. \\"To violate this combination is every where a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbors and equals.\\" (Pg. 66-67) Yet he also notes that the inhabitants of a town \\"can easily combine together,\\" so that by voluntary associations and agreements they prevent that free competition \\"which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws.\\" (Pg. 126) He observes that \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\\" (Pg. 128)Of course, the most lastingly influential idea in the book is his concept of the \\"invisible hand,\\" by which an individual who \\"intends only his own gain... (is) led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\\" He adds ironically, \\"I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.\\" (Pg. 423)Ultimately, the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them toward tasks which are most advantageous to society. \\"Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society ... as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.\\" (Pg. 594-595)One cannot adequately summarize a masterwork such as Smith's within the confines of an Amazon review, of course.

This should be required reading for all.Ivy League Wealth Secrets: That the Master Planners don't want you to know!"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"According to Adam Smith, wealth is achieved through the division of their labour and the ever-greater specialisation of their skills. It is not from benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe. Finally, Adam Smith believes that nations will become rich only if natural liberty is promulgated for, society has a natural tendency to allocate resources in the best way. This is now widely known as the \\"invisible hand\\" theory."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"This book is huge!!!

Science)","review":"I don't recommend you this abridged audio book. Please get the complete audio, and that's why.This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to listen it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist.

Science)","review":"Probably the most important book ever written has as much to say to us today as it did in 1766 . Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nation\\" establishes the theoretical framework for Capitalism covering every aspect of an economic system that has created the highest standard of living known to man. Adam Smith shows how the interplay between labor, stock and land serve to generate the wealth of a nation. The keys to wealth are freedom, productive men, productive stock, and productive land. Smith says that the role of government is threefold - to protect the land from foreign invasion, enforce contracts and maintain a physical and legal infrastructure that promotes commerce and investment. Government produces nothing and therefore the expense of government reduces the wealth of a nation. Taxes are akin to a proportional reduction in the productivity of labor, stock and land and so should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the wealth of a nation. Any government role beyond the promotion and protection of investment reduces the wealth of a nation and of its people Adam Smith would oppose the many government programs that litter the landscape of the Federal Government today. Welfare, Social Security, education spending by the government, and other non-defense or infrastructure related expenditures diminish the productivity of the people and consequently their wealth. The majority of the people in the United States would have been much wealthier had it not been for these programs.Adam Smith was also a proponent of free trade. He understood that countries varied in the productivity of the land and the people and that only through free trade could the advantages inherent in different lands and peoples be harnessed to increase the wealth of nations. He opposed guilds and unions which only protected the few at the expense of the many and consequently reduced the wealth of a nation by reducing the productivity of its people.Adam Smith was truly a man for all season and for all time. It's unfortunate that our politicians and educators are more familiar and enamored by the idiot Karl Marx than they are with Adam Smith. For if they revered Adam Smith as much as they revere Marx we would all be wealthier and happier."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"*This review, needless to say, is long. It is for people who have an interest in classical political economy and its relation to the marginalist tradition. What I have attempted to do is take a critical approach toward contemporary mainstream economics based on what is written in the Wealth of Nations. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to constructive criticism and debate.Adam Smith has had by far the greatest general impact on the formation of economic theory of all economic thinkers since - it was he who cast the mold within which the future of economic thought would take place. What I believe has been neglected in most accounts of Smith's contributions to economic theory, however, is that in his attempt at establishing a unified theory of political economy he was instead responsible for developing the framework from which two conflicting theoretical approaches towards economic analysis would later be derived - one with focus on market relations and the other with focus on the relations of production. This marks the beginnings of what has been, in my opinion, a major inconsistency in the development of economic thought - the incompatibility of the former tradition of economic analysis, when taken in isolation from the latter, with the main pivot of Smith's theoretical justification for capitalist development in the \`Wealth of Nations'. The separation of these two areas, it will be argued, has been the result of the further development of certain aspects of Smiths core theoretical insights to the exclusion of deeper inquiry into an understanding of his attempted explanation of their origin and nature. Its product has been a superficial understanding of economic phenomena under capitalist relations responsible for the endless stream of conclusions that manage to both be incompatible with one another and claim immutability. Its practical impact has been to legitimize a system of ideas, culminating in the \`discovery' of universal economic laws detached from and functioning independent of social relations, that has fettered the further cultural and political progression of humanity through the intellectual impoverishment of human life.----------The \`Wealth of Nations', though it was overwhelmingly concerned with practical application and the specific policies of its time, has not cast such a long shadow on the progression of economic thought simply by merit of its attacks on the effects of Mercantilist economic policy. There were political economists before and after Smith who had carried out similar attacks, as is shown by the fact that Smith derived his argument against Mercantilist protectionist policy from Hume. Instead, the major impact of the \`Wealth of Nations' on economic thought has been its attempted establishment of a theoretical framework in which individual self interest was the driving force of an economic system that was propelled by its own momentum and functioned according to its own laws. In Schumpeter's words, it put forth the major assertion that \\"the free interaction of individuals produces not chaos but an orderly pattern that is logically determined\\". This orderly pattern was, for Smith, the tendential movement of the market prices of commodities toward their natural values. The major theoretical task of the \`Wealth of Nations' was an unveiling of the mechanisms that function to ensure this continuous movement of all nominal values toward their natural values within the framework of the free interaction of individuals. In this sense, Smith's argument against the Mercantilist system of political economy was, for all intensive purposes, an application ofhis general theory of natural value; there existed a \`natural' level to which any artificial adjustment in the quantity of money would adjust. The thrust of Smith's critiques on the effects of the Mercantilist doctrine are to be interpreted in the context of this distinction between natural and artificial value, within which its effects are extended beyond simple redundancy.Smith began his theory of value and price determination with a distinction between what he called the natural value of commodities and their market price, or their nominal and real price. The market price of a commodity is the price at any given moment of time in which commodities are exchanging for one another. Market prices fluctuate as a reaction to myriad natural and manmade phenomena and are in turn regulated by the interplay of supply and demand. If a drought adversely affects the yield of corn for a given period it would be the cause of a reduction in the supply of corn in relation to the level of effectual demand and a subsequent increase in market price; if it for some reason becomes fashionable to wear pink overcoats, assuming of course that individuals in a given society desire to be fashionable, then the effectual demand for pink overcoats will increase in relation to available supply and consequently so will the market price of pink overcoats. Value, on the other hand, is the point around which these movements, or vibrations, of price gravitate. Smith believed that individual commodities will rarely, if ever, exchange at their value due to constant changes and/or disruptions in the conditions of any given market. The hypothetical; point at which value and price meet may be understood as the more familiar concept of equilibrium; the point that competition would yield in the long run through the interplay of supply and demand on the market.The importance of these two concepts for Smith's theoretical framework was the effect that competition had on individual producers to cause the prices of commodities to always be in tendential movement toward their value. Essentially competition, which was restricted under the auspices of the \`Commercial System', was the force acting on individual producers which would ensure, in the long run, that commodities would be bought and sold at precisely the amount required to produce them - their value. There are two main justifications for the desirable nature of this process. On the one hand Smith believed that when prices were at their value the entire economic system was in turn at the highest point of efficiency and equality it could possibly be. On the other hand, Smith believed that this movement would ultimately benefit the mass of people with lower prices, which would continue to decrease in proportion to the advances in the conditions of production of commodities. Competition would in turn pressure individual producers to apply these cost lowering technical advances to the production process because of the need to reduce the value of their commodities in order to command a larger share of their respective markets, hence allowing for a higher rate of profit and the ability to continually reinvest their capital to repeat the same process indefinitely. Thus, it was on this tendency of competition to move the prices of commodities toward their values, and in time to reduce their values, that Smith's entire justification for the elimination of Mercantilist protection and privilege in favor of a system based on the free interaction of individuals ultimately rested. Not only was the Mercantilist doctrine of money manipulation redundant, but the means by which it attempted to achieve this ultimate redundancy prevented the functioning of extremely powerful mechanisms that Smith believed ensured the long run reduction in values of commodities - the betterment of the masses of people through the further development of the productive forces of society. As Schumpeter described: \\"It is the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of the factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort\\"Contemporary mainstream economics, a position held by the neoclassical tradition, though seemingly rejecting value as an \`economic' concept, has in fact incorporated selective parts of what has been its derivative into their theory of prices in market economies. This has been accomplished by simply supplanting the tension between value and price with what is their emergent concept of equilibrium, within which the whole of their analysis of price formation takes place. Within their framework, though for all intense and purposes similar, the nature of equilibrium, being for Smith a hypothetical position of the meeting of value and price, thus takes on an entirely different meaning. They essentially adopted a view of equilibrium as being determined by the equalization of the supply of commodities with their respective demand, the signals to which occur in exchange relations on the market. There is no contrast on which Smith placed prime importance between the 'natural' value determined in production to which all \`artificial' prices determined in exchange are constantly tending, but simply \`equilibrium' prices as given by the aggregation of subjective judgments of individuals - thus making the interaction of market mechanisms with man, which Smith attributed solely to the measuring rod of \`market' price, the explanation of value a. In this regard, 'value' is transformed into a function of the influence of demand upon costs of s well production - more specifically on the last fragment of want not satisfied - and ultimately purported to be a subjective calculation of individuals. Prices are now the reflection of the interaction between these marginal rates of substitution of individual consumers and marginal costs of production of producers - Marginal substitution as the demand schedule of individuals which, operating under the \`law' of diminishing marginal utility, decreases for every increase in the price of a commodity and increases for every decrease in the price of a commodity; Marginal cost as the supply schedule of producers which, under conditions of diminishing returns, decreases as more units are produced.The effect of this change, curiously enough, was largely on the classical theories of distribution. By shifting the focus of an inquiry into the forces acting on price away from the realm of production to the realm of exchange, essentially making the regulating force of price the subjective valuations of commodities and their impact on the costs of producing those commodities, it rendered meaningless what was of prime importance for Ricardo, and Marx thereafter - distribution between economic classes and its deterministic effects on the outcome of exchange. Theories of distribution had formerly attempted to explain the division of value between different social classes in a given society. Smith himself identified the \`three great classes' of society to \\"which the price of every commodity ultimately resolved\\" as being landowners, laborers, and manufactures - it was Ricardo, and more extensively Marx afterward, that showed the conditions in which this division of value between them took place was located in the realm of production before exchange took place. Gracious as they were in escaping them, these questions of class and the division of value between them became for economists not so much irrelevant in a greater sense, but \`outside' of what economic analysis set out to answer as they were now \`outside' of the theoretical determination of price. There was no longer a separation between exchange value and use value, but the derivation of exchange value from use value (utility). Distribution therefore became determined not from conditions of production but from exchange relations.This subtle maneuver of redefining equilibrium, or we should say using it for different purposes, served to retain positive aspects of Smith's analysis to the exclusion of what the logical extension of his system by further inquiry unveiled: It ultimately served the exact same purpose of having competition operate to tend prices to a point of efficiency and equality, where things are sold at precisely what they are worth (now subjectively determined by some feat of aggregating what occurs on the individual level of optimizing preferences), thus allowing for the maintenance of the virtuous development that Smith associated with the free interaction of individuals and the discarding of the negative features that became associated with Marx's later \`socially necessary labor time'. Not only were the later logical extensions of Ricardo and Marx that spoiled the virtuous cycle done away with in a single stroke, but extremely important aspects of Smith - from the identification and examination of the interaction between social classes to the objective nature of value existing in production - were all safely brushed aside.The vicious circle, however, eventually caught up with utopia: the attempted formalization of this interplay between market mechanisms and man as both the measuring rod of and the explanation for value brought an inconsistency: initial distribution continued to claim overarching priority in the formation of price. The expression of utility that was the interaction of man with the market could not possibly be based on subjective measurements of value, but on the actual purchasing power which translated into market pull. Thus, the independent postulation of some pre-existing income level or distribution was necessary for the internal consistency of any formal demonstration of price determination based on marginal utility. Essentially, This is the root of what will later be shown to be the major contradiction in the superficial extension of Adam Smith; it essentially revolves around the assumption most fundamental to all conceptual frameworks, that question supposedly \`outside' of the economists' domain - value.--------As Smith believes that the market price of commodities, regulated by their value, is established by the forces of supply and demand, he in turn identifies the natural price of commodities, the actual substance of value, as being equal to the labor necessary to produce them. He holds the latter to be the case because he believes that a commodity is essentially worth the amount of labor it is able to command on the market - if the producer of X enters into exchange relations with the producer of Y, and the production of X requires 10 hours or labor whereas the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor, then, in the hypothetical instance of commodities exchanging at their value, the producer of X will exchange one unit of X for two units of Y. Already within the beginning of his inquiry is the major problem, and what in the end removes all unity from his whole conceptual framework, to be found. It arises from the fact that Smith ultimately merges his explanation of the substance of value into what he before held as distinct, market relations - for what Smith is now basing his explanation of value upon is here the extent to which labor can be commanded in exchange, and not the \\"so much less labour than before\\" that makes up the substance of exchange value, or the labor embodied within commodities in the process of production.Let us examine this issue further. Smith, in holding the labor commanded by commodities as the explanation of their value, is essentially making what amounts to the same claim that it is the labor necessary to produce commodities that is the determinant of their value ONLY under conditions in which the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. Under these conditions Smith sees no contradiction because there is none; it is only after the fact that this separation comes to play a destructive role. We can easily see why Smith thought this to be the case - when a producer of a product exchanges this product, in which only his labor was used to produce, with an individual who has done the same, the labor which each of these commodities command on the market is equivalent to the labor embodied within them. There is X amount of labor embodied in the commodity, and the laborer, appropriating the whole product, thus exchanges it and receives X amount of materialized labor in return for it. Confusion sets in on Smith when he attempts to extend the labor commanded theory of value to instances in which labor is not the sole 'factor' ofproduction, but land and capital as well. He runs head on into what is seemingly a major problem - if labor does not appropriate the whole of its produce, but a portion is divided between either rent to a landlord or profit to a capitalist (manufacturer, in his words), then labor commanded is no longer equal to the price of the commodity it produces. The price of commodities on the market will in general be higher than the exchange value of labor. As Smith is well aware that he must have an explanation of value consistent with \\"the three great classes of society\\" for the functionality of his entire schemata, if only because the appropriation of the full product of labor by the laborer was \\"at end...long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour\\", he is now seemingly forced to discard the applicability of the labor necessary to produce commodities as an explanation of value to a society in which labor is not the sole \`factor of production' of commodities.Instead of further unraveling this contradiction, the task of which was left to Ricardo, and, more extensively Marx, Smith adopts what is now called a \`cost of production' theory of value - essentially, as Smith sees the necessity of the incorporation of \\"the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land\\" into his conceptual apparatus, he simply makes the \\"natural value\\" to which all \\"market prices are constantly gravitating\\" equivalent to the \`returns' to land, labor, and capital based on the observation that it is into these \\"three parts\\" which \\"the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\\". Of course, \`value' is in this sense superfluous - simply identifying that rentiers, capitalists, and laborers all receive a portion of the value of commodities does not serve as an explanation of where the value of these commodities derives; but, then again, this is our problem, is it not? We can now see the starting point of superficial extensions - of profit simply being another form of wages for inspection and direction, risk or abstinence, which becomes plucked out of its proper context as being linked to the value of the stock employed. From whence does this value come - the sky? Thus, we are yet again gifted with another gem in the \`production possibility frontier' of neoclassical economics - in which there can be no mistaking the superficiality of \`switching between capital and labor'. Neither can the perspective required for the exposition of such insight be mistaken.It is in the evasion of one contradiction which Smith naturally becomes entangled in another, his recognition of this being doubtful. The contradiction materializes when Smith moves on to his analysis of the \`Wages of Labour', where he correctly maintains that returns to land and capital are derivative from labor and labor alone. Smith thus becomes his own greatest enemy, for he has now, quite explicitly, singlehandedly refuted both his own labor commanded theory of value and his cost of production theory of value. The only unifying force, and luckily for Smith what remains implicit throughout his whole analysis of the division of labor, is a labor embodied theory of value - that \`returns' to land and capital are not returns at all, but appropriation from the labor which they employ. Thus we have come to one major critique levied against Smith by Ricardo - the division of value between classes in no way refutes the principle that value is derived from labor.There are two rreasons why I believe that Smith did not realize his self contradictions: first, this contradiction was spelled out quite plainly, whereas the former was not. It thus makes little sense for Smith to have not made any attempt to remedy it as he did the former from which it came; second, and more importantly, the so called cost of production theory of value was, for all intents and purposes, consistent with his notion of tendential movements of price toward \`value', much in the same way as neoclassical equilibrium theory is functional solely by merit of the identification of a given supply. What it was not consistent with, which will be shown later, was his theory of the division of labor and the increases in productivity that it allowed as a function of decreasing value. It is from the combination of what Smith, in arguing with himself, found to be dead ends with his concept of the division of labor, on which the development of the former aspect of his inquiry relied, that is at the core my claims.---The Division of Labor---In sweeping away the Mercantilist doctrine, Smith put forth a new answer to the question of how to increase the wealth of nations; that it was be found in the realm of production, more specifically in finding a mechanism the influence of which caused improvements in the conditions of production. These improvements were the development of the productive forces which, by reducing the amount of labor required to produce them, caused a reduction in the value of commodities. Smith identified this mechanism as the division of labor.The division of labor, however, did not serve only to reduce the value of material output - it both fostered the growth and application of specialized knowledge to further innovate the production process. Innovations which were responsible for the introduction of new products and the increased efficiency of the production of existing products were the result of the division of labor. This is because a specialized producer would be more far more likely to posses, or have a much greater possibility of obtaining, the requisite knowledge to improve a product and themethod by which that product was produced than a person who was forced to spread his or her time across the production of many different products. The mechanism of the division of labor, in turn, was identified by Smith as being a function of the volume of exchange between individuals. He believed that when people regularly engaged in exchange relations they would become inclined to specialize in production - i.e. spontaneously form a division of labor. This is because with every increase in specialization there is in turn an increase in the volume of exchange due to a subsequent decrease in the self sufficiency of individuals. If an individual who formerly produced the whole of his or her necessary product specializes in the production of one of these products, he or she must then engage in exchange relations to obtain the rest. The growth in the volume of exchange then served to expand the division of labor, which itself served to expand the volume of exchange as it allowed for the individual the ability \\"to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor\\" and therefore \\"encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation\\".Thus, as exchange gave rise to the division of labor, and the volume of exchange was in turn directly influenced through the division of labor, the result was an increasing hold of the division of labor on society. The division of labor, then, functioned as a positive feedback mechanism. There was, however, a natural limit to the internal expansion of the division of labor. Smith identified this limit as the extent of the market, or the area in which exchange relations were able to occur. The essential notion behind this concept was that the extent of specialization between producers depended on the mass of producers available to specialize. Smith describes this phenomena with an identification of the further integration of the division of labor in areas that contain a large mass of people, such as \` great towns', as opposed to a small population, such as the countryside.IIAs Smith held that exchange was the driving force behind the expanse of the division of labor, and that this exchange was limited only by the extent of the market, he identified the elimination of spatial and temporal barriers - modern day \`transaction costs' - as the means by which exchange was able to be carried out in a widened area, and hence the means throughwhich the division of labor was able to more deeply integrate itself. This is because these eliminations served to open up further avenues of exchange between individuals and, flirting with their propensities to \\"truck, barter, and exchange\\", led to further expanse of the division of labor. Thus, Smith identified the emergence of commercial civilizations, or, as he says, the first \\"civilized\\" nations, in regions that had fewer barriers to exchange than others. As far as how this reduction of temporal and spatial barriers was accomplished, Smith was rather ambiguous. However, it seems fairly evident that he viewed the division of labor itself as the force that would accomplish this task in the long run. This is because Smith identified the division of labor as not only the instigator of increased material productivity but as the force through which innovation was fostered.But had a division of labor not already existed? And if so, why did the division of labor neither perpetuate itself as Smith had envisioned nor serve to harness the application of the creative potential of individuals to widen the market? Smith's answer to this was that the division of labor that existed, because it was not a system of free enterprise but a manifestation of Mercantilist doctrine, created an atmosphere of monopoly and special privilege that restricted or distorted the forces that signaled the spontaneous ordering of production. In a system of free enterprise, competition between individual producers would both incentivize the actual applications of innovations that the granting of special privileges and subsidies deinsentivized and would eliminate monopoly control because any sector with an above average profit rate would attract production that was formerly involved in a sector with a lower rate of profit, and therefore also ensuring the important movement of price toward value. The regulating force of competition was the main ingredient necessary to bring to life the positive feedback mechanism of the division of labor. Protection was preventing the functioning of the division of labor which, per contra to the conscience construction of Mercantilist policy, functioned by merit of a mechanism which was independent of the conscience design of man.It is in this context of Mercantilist protection policies that Smith's remarks on the interests of manufactures being at odds with that of society as a whole should be interpreted 12. For Smith, the secret of the wealth of nations was to be found in the positive feedback mechanism embedded in the link between the division of labor and the extent of the market: an increase in the division of labor lowers costs, raises real income, and extends the market, thus leading back to an increase in the division of labor and an increase in the extent of the market. Smith held that exchange between individual producers regulated by competition would cause the materialization and expansion of this virtuous cycle. It is in this sense that exchange is considered the driver of growth: it enlarges the pool in which the division of labor exists. The entirety of modern exchange based growth theory is thus derived from Adam Smith. Any argument put forth that identifies \`barriers' or \`limitations' on the ability to exchange being the immediate cause of poverty is thus derived from Adam Smith. Not only that, but Smith also implies that technological innovation is a factor endogenous to production based on a spontaneous division of labor. As technological progress is the long run mechanism through which temporal and spatial barriers are eliminated, not only does short run poverty due to the inability to exchange in this way derive from Smith, but the long run increase in the standard of living of the masses as well. The whole of contemporary mainstream economics has been an attempted formalization of the requirements needed for Smith's division of labor to function. This is the power that lies within the first twenty pages of the \`Wealth of Nations'.IIIBut it is precisely in this moment of glory where the disconnect occurs. For the role attributed to the division of labor is inexorably tied to the notion that labor is the \\"real measure of exchangeable value of all commodities\\". Redefining value as being determined in exchange contradicts the whole foundation of the Smith's division of labor: if the functioning of the division of labor is to reduce the value of commodities through paradigm shifts in how they are produced in the long run, in their conditions of production, then it is within the production process alone that an explanation of value must rest. Smith himself, in putting forth the labor commanded theory of value, maintained consistency with his theory of the division of labor to the extent that individual producers appropriated their own product. As this was incapable of being extended to capitalist production, Smith then switched to a cost of production theory of value in order to escape the trap he had laid for himself. However, as we have shown, this theory of value was not a theory of value at all and thus was incapable of explaining anything other than showing a hypothetical point at which value and price would be equal - it was therefore incompatible with the dynamic nature of the division of labor. It is from the latter which contemporary equilibrium analysis has its origins, and, quite naturally, why equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economics had also been doomed to a static existence: dynamics could only be incorporated as an element disturbing equilibrium, whereas within the whole of the operation of the division of labor equilibrium is only a fleeting moment of a vibration which is in ceaseless fluctuation. Smith, despite his fumbling, maintained conceptual unity because the whole of his division of labor was based around an environment wherein labor commanded was for all intents and purposes equivalent to labor embodied - or a world where the laborer appropriated the whole of his or her produce. His inclusion of the pin factory example, while highlighting the increase of productivity it allowed, served to hide the fact that this productivity was a function of a specific explanation of value. This dualistic nature, or perhaps the high degree of ambiguity, in which Smith conducted his analysis of the division of labor therefore turned out to be both his weakest and strongest point.This dualism carried on to his heirs, however it now took different form. In adopting the marginalist approach to value, it manifested itself in an attempt to explain the functioning of an economic system according to individual self interest as a function of profit on the basis, or perspective, of individuals who have left the production process, or left the process in which material objects are produced as a prerequisite for profit. Exchange, without production, yields no profit; no growth. I may trade you nine apples for one of your apples, a deal in which you have convinced me beyond doubt is best for both of us, and in the end we still have between us ten apples. This attempted escape, however, was not an escape at all but instead served to shift the search of error and inconsistency to the confines of marginalism, and, as we have shown that it was a purely exchange driven explanation of value, financial speculative excess naturally became the issue. For where there is no production process, or when value is explained in the ct the value of which is rooted in exchange becomes more a function of the degree to which people are holding it - hoarding it - as concerns scarcity than the aggregation of marginal propensities. The recent popularity of 'behavioral' economics corresponds to this identification."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations(by wealth he meant the total productive capacity of a country's skilled and educated labor force,combined with its industrial manufacturing capacity and agricultural produce)is the brilliant effort of a famous moral philosopher to extend the range of his analysis from the theoretical \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to the practical application of political economy in a country populated by decision makers who were practicing Judeo-Christians or Deists (who attempted to put into practice the Ten Commandments in their everyday lives).The terms \\"self interest\\" and\\"Invisible Hand\\" appear in both books.Smith was a friend/acquaintance of the founders of the 18th century \\"rationalism\\"of Voltaire,Rousseau,and Hume that advocated the enlightenment that would result if humans would make use of a scientific approach to reason based on an empirical/experimental analysis of the world.The enlightenment philosophers were,in general, anticlerical and opposed to organized religion.However, they were not opposed to the deistic position,which many of them adopted. It is very clear from the context in both books that Smith is referring to the enlightened self interest of moral decision makers who have had specific religious instruction,as well as a general education.Smith spends nearly 50 pages(Smith,pp.716-766) advocating the necessity of such instruction,if necessary funded by the public .Both of Smith's books must be read together in order to understand his overall philosophy.The Libertarian approach,which considers only a small portion of Smith's second book, is a caricature of Smith .Smith advocated a progressive system of taxation.Smith advocated usury laws(interest rate controls).The First Bank of the United States,set up by Alexander Hamilton,was modeled after the central bank control concepts of Adam Smith,as opposed to the free banking advocated by libertarians.Most importantly,Smith's theory of comparative advantage opposed any offshoring of either employment and/or industrial/financial capital if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market.Such foreign investment can only be made to supply the foreign market.Smith was one of the first opponents of globalization,since globalization directly conflicted with the theory of comparative advantage.Globalization advocates base their arguments on absolute advantage.Finally,Smith fully supported the use of counter tariffs if there was any probability that such a counter tariff would succeed in getting the offending nation to remove its initial tariff.Only if there was no probability of success would Smith forgo retaliation.A reader of both of Smith's books will discover quickly that he would have no sympathy for the atheistic materialism of any variety of anarchistic libertarianism. Smith would thus have been an ardent advocate of the conservative Federalist position of Washington,Hamilton,Madison,Franklin,Jay,etc.,while opposing the libertarian views of Paine,Mason,and Henry."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

Science)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist.

Science)","review":"I appreciate that for most readers, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is going to be a deadly dull read, although I think this is a pity. With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective.

Science)","review":"A couple of years ago I went to a local bookstore determined to read 'Capital' as well as 'Wealth of Nations,' but since there wasn't a copy of the latter available at the time, I picked up the former, waded through all three volumes (which were very hard and took me 18 months), then went back to Smith. This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property.

Except that everybody, gives up searching for the answers to these questions and accepts the meaningless explanation: what we see happenning in human society, happens in this way because this is how it should happen. Or because of .. the raise of the prices on the market, for example. (Obviously prices are something like a natural natural phenomena - raise of the tempratures in the northern hemisphere , humidity in the air,...) After several \\"explanations\\" of this kind , one gives up - it is immpossible to find out what is going on in society because this is the purpose. The less people know, the better for ... for everyone who can take advantage out of this.For 90% (well this is my evaluation) of the people what is going on with money and prices is a mystery. At the same time they are forced to participate in this \\"game\\" and participate in some stupid manner. Then a game that is played in a stupid manner and played by players, unwilling to play it (at least for 90% of them this is just a burden) will come to a crush eventually. It seems it is inevitable that there will always be crises every 30-40 years.I do not know whether Adam Smith is correct in his explanations but I think he is absolutely correct that one must search the reason for the processes that take place in society."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

It does not, and cannot care for the result or timing of its actions. Eventually a market will seek equilibrium, but that can be a few months, a few years, or generations. The Dark Ages were as much a result of the slowness of the market as the lack of insitutions.An amazing work given the times it was written in and the tools Mr. Smith had at his disposal.cg"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

The multitude of examples and depth of discussion could stop a Mack truck, but the lessons are critical. It teaches you about the true nature of money; where it comes from, what it means.

Science)","review":"With the exception of Adam Smith not outright condenming slavery the book is a brilliant economics book. And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"Though Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is a true classic written in lucid English, and the foundation of our modern economy, I cannot say that it is all-too-important for most people to read this book. Weighing in 700+ pages for a typical printing, this work is not a quick and easy read by any stretch of the imagination. Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it. For anyone studying economics, of course, this work is the bread and butter of your field - and is a must read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

No, but this Kindle edition has modernized spelling and lost the random capitalization. The vocabulary is be a little challenging, but that's why your Kindle has a dictionary built in - and you may also need Google, as I did, for some of the more obscure usages. A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy? A little repetitive? Yes, Smith could have used a good editor. But not to be missed.

Yes-this book changed my outlook on life!You know you are reading a work of timeless genius when you can apply directly what a man wrote in 1776 to the year 2010.If you are considering buying this book be aware of a few things:1) This book was published in 1776-and uses 1776 english. It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable.

This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office.

This is by far the most expensive Kindle edition of Adam Smith, and shouldn't have screwed up its notes -- the only reason for paying five extra dollars -- in this way.Let me add that the Amazon reviewing mechanism is, as usual, inadequate for reviewing Kindle editions; my review ends up one of over fifty reviews discussing the book in general, not the Kindle edition specifically."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

The Modern Library's Kindle version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a case in point. The footnotes, which appear at the end of each chapter, are all run together in one big paragraph, without any numbers to show where each footnote begins. Moreover, while the footnote references in the text are linked, the links take you only to the start of the footnotes for that chapter, rather than to the pertinent footnote itself. A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library. Science)","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Everyman's library.

This book is a true masterpiece and laid the foundations for modern economic analysis. Though later criticised by many, Smith remains one of the most lucid thinkers on capitalism, despite the fact that he is permanently underestimated in the face of people like Marx. 222 years after its original publication, it maintains its powerful insights.

His writing is like nothing I've ever read before, though he has been compared in to Richard Carver in some circles, and called a Polish-Kerouac in others.\\"Streets\\" immediately became one of my most cherished poetry anthologies (I loved it so much I bought a signed first edition). It is hypnotic, haunting, riveting, and I recommend it to all poetry readers who are interested in modern poetry and free-verse style.\\"Anti-Memoir\\" is perhaps the best poem of the set:\\"Tonight, follow the mute street singer / Unimpended by sight, he leads/down passageways you thought deleted, / diction stripped like stolen cars, / barricades of syntax broken by emotion, / sighs of plaster dust, the haze / of white space between words. Don't pause / for punctuation, here, a comma / of indecision elides into a coma, / and, years later, one wakes / to the interminable typing of rain / in a hotel where transients waste / money good for alcohol's blue flame/on sleep. Outside, the homeless / congregate while you continue to rent / all the rooms you've left to behind, / addresses one must be lost to find, / knee deep in flooded storm drains / clogged with crushed revisions, / a shredded blizzard, a ticker tape parade / gusting from the out-turned pockets / of the dead, enough litter / to trash the future, fuel without heat, / and yet, the past combustible enough to be compressed into a fistful of soot.\\"This is an example of the style, but is not the entire poem and is less effective when read out of context (or without it's beginning or end).I highly recommend this anthology, as well as all of Stuart Dybek's writing. It is my humble opinion that \\"The Coast of Chicago\\" (prose) and \\"Streets\\" are the best examples of his work."},{"Title":"Colorado Mathematical Olympiad: The First Ten Years and Further Explorations","review":"I've taken the Olympiad exams as a high school student, and helped grade the exams after high school.

However, after reading all the other reviews, my opinion (and only my opinion) was that they were slightly misleading. I am referring particularly to the three descriptions this book seems to generate most - Timeless, Hilarious and Kafkaesque.First let me say that I enjoyed \\"Heart of a Dog\\" very much. I liked it, which is why I rated it four stars. I thought the satire very pointed, the humor endearing, and the premise absurdly good. Obviously Bulgakov was a dedicated, intelligent man, one who was prepared to suffer for what he had to say, and it is truly a crime that did.But I did not think \\"Heart of a Dog\\" is hilarious, and not necessarily timeless. Not that those are prerequisite qualities, but if someone is searching these reviews, deciding whether or not they should invest in this book, they may mistake it for a piece of slapstick, which it is not. Yes, there are some funny bits to it, but don't expect the Marx Brothers.Another superlative given is timeless, and here I both agree and disagree. I thought that Bulgakov tied this novel to a very distinctive time and place, which was attempting a particular experiment with its social structure. Bulgakov eviscerates that in just a few pages, as is what I think his goal was. The references to organ transplants between animal and human, daily life under soviet rules, and the particular anger of the poor toward the priveliged are all subjects that both date and locate this novel, and may be somewhat challenging for modern readers to fully appreciate.Bulgakov makes a bold statement with this book - that it is not possible to drag the mass of humanity out of the servile and backward state they are in by force. It must happen naturally. What does strike me as timeless is that there are still powers today who try changing entire nations, through shock and awe, and are convinced that the people will automatically come round to the \\"only\\" enlightened and democratic point of view, once they are liberated from the past.It's no wonder to me that Bulgakov's work was suppressed. He may save his most biting comments for the Soviet system, but, by inference, he doesn't have much regard for the common man either, except as commoners. But then Bulgakov may have been having his fun with everyone. The bourgeoisie get a bit of a poke in the eye here too. But I cannot understand why anyone would refer to this novel as Kafkaesque. Aside from the transformation aspect in \\"The Metamorphosis\\", I don't see any similarities at all.One other quick note - this edition has one of the most apt cover designs I've ever seen on a book. The look on the dog's face, looking back over his shoulder, dovetails quite well with the interior.While I wouldn't say it is hilarious, or Kafkaesque( I think it is Bulgakovian), and may not go so far as timeless, I do think \\"Heart of a Dog\\" is both thought-provoking and enjoyable. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Besides the fact that this book has the greatest, grab-you-by-the-throat beginning I've ever seen, this book establishes Bulgakov in my mind as a giant - in Russian literature, alongside Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and Solzhenytsin - and in 20th century literature. Don't let my name-dropping fool you - there is simply no one I can complare Bulgakov to. Who else can get inside the mind, as well as the heart of a dog as he is transformed in to a human-like creature after a gland graft. Blending sharp, piquant writing with pathos and svage satire, this book is a worthy companion to &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. They sit together on my bookshelf (but never for too long)."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"While there seemed to be a good story here, and it was mildly amusing (though I must admit I know only a little about Soviet Russian history), the translation (by Michael Glenny) was pretty bad. I found it very hard sometimes to follow what was going on, as the point of view seemingly kept changing around at will. Also, the edition I read would have been vastly improved had there been some way (typographically?) to separate out the dog's thoughts from the general narration--as it is they just run together, heightening the translation problems. I hear that the Ginsburg translation is much better, so you may want to read that version instead."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Renowned Proffessor Philip Philipovich tempts a stray dog, Sharik, back to his apartment.Together with his colleague Dr Bormenthal, he conducts an experiment; transplanting a human pituitry gland into the brain of the dogs. A nightmare begins....A fast paced comic novel that reminds of Gogol's 'Diary of a Madman',Bulgakov aims a thinly disguised attack on the disaster that the Russian revolution was becoming; the commitees run by illiterate half wits who revel in their petty power; the stiffling affect of political dogma on progress and human betterment and-as with Sharik-the foolishness of trying to make someone or something they cannot be when it runs contra to human nature.Arguably better than 'The Master and Margarita' which-to my mind- suffered from over egging the satire due to endless re-writes and moving targets- 'Heart of a Dog' was written in one take, finds its target and predicts the disaster that the 'Russian experiment' became.As with religion; the ethics and ideas may be fine,its the practice where it all falls apart.Enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Great \\"little-big book\\" although a horrible print job and poor translation; just as another reader describes it, this was probably printed using a word recognition program which \\"misread\\" combination of letters. Choices of words are often very poor, as if translated by google. Russian slang specific of the early communist era is peppered with self-loathing and deprecating expresions aimed at both the tyrants and at the enslaved alike. The easier way to try to understand this world better is to think of Communism as a fable happening on a joyless planet from where there is no escape (just as no one can escape gravity) and where the spectrum of feelings ranges only between envy and negative reinforcement. Just one specific example of missing the mark on translation: A \\"Dustman\\" happens to be just another job in the western world (in some cases, one relatively well paid too), but in the communist cultural context, it is a derogatory call aimed to portray a worthless person. The intent is to comprise in one word an unkempt smelly imbecil and crude day-laborer, just an inch above the animal level, whose existence happens between work and vodka. A better transaltion would have been a made-up word such as a \\"Garbager\\", or \\"Wastepusher\\". Granted, that the cultural transformation of a human who grows up under socialism cannot be readily grasped in a free society. Almost one hundred years after its first disastrous application, which was repeated with same results dozens of times since, Westerners continue to dwell in and \\"toy\\" with the ideology of socialism. What is often idealized as a \\"classless society\\", it turns out to be a horribly rigid cast system made up of the proletariat (ruling class), peasantry, intelectuality and \\"youth\\" (students) and within each there are further divisions based on favoritisms, nepotisms and Communist Party membership. The Eastern Europeans have lived thru the practical application of this abomination and for over half a century they endured the outcome of socialism in its two extreme forms which are strickingly similar: fascism (national socialism) and communism (materialist/atheist socialism). To try to understand the background of this book, it leads one thru the depressing journey of discovery of what the real \\"socialist promiseland\\" looks like. This is not easy to do when your other options are TV reality shows, fear factors or some weekly academy award show - ignorance in different forms... Describing the perils of conformity to mass ignorance of those who know and who could do better otherwise, can make for a grotesque true life comedy, but one which parallels the bitter tragedy of lives wasted at the altar of utopian ignorance. Except for the dog transformation, all other characters and their behavior, thoughts, acts, etc., are true depictions of the real life in the USSR - a world in which a half-human-half-dog happens to blend in perfectly. Read it and try to overlook the bad translation. We all carry the dormant socialist virus within us, which always becomes active when fed by the ignorance of the masses."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I can't say much about this book that hasn't already been said. It's hilarious, disturbing, bitingly satirical and a profoundly apt little allegory for the forces Bulgakov saw developing in Russia after the revolution. The image of a dog-turned-man coming to occupy an official government position rounding up stray cats is absurd, funny, and just works on so many levels. I'm reminded of what Frank Herbert said about power: it's not that power corrupts, but power which attracts the corruptible. With the instincts of a dog and the behavior of a common criminal, the novel's main character is a perfect image of the type of person attracted to a bureaucracy of brutality, arbitrariness, and pure and simple inhumanity. As a reader more accustomed to perhaps dry and academic accounts of such phenomena (for example,Political PonerologyandNuremberg Diary), it was a pleasant relief to see these ideas portrayed with such creativity and fun. Bulgakov was and is a treasure."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov scores points for bravery in this scalding, Soviet-era diatribe against totalitarian idealism. Comparing the synthetic Russian comrade--a hybrid of human bits and 20th century experimentation--with a lowly cur from the sidewalks of Moscow makes a vivid statement. That is, especially when the author risks the gulag for writing it. This, plus the inventiveness of the story, elevates Heart of the Dog above the quotidian.But I found this piece rife with problems, starting with the first-person perspective of Sharik, a dog whose thoughts dwell on the base side of canine pleasures: tearing the life out of a cat or \\"torturing a grouse head.\\" And this proclivity is mirrored in the humanity around him. Running amok in a climate where \\"Neither man nor animal can be influenced by anything but suggestion,\\" everything outside the furniture, bones, knives and glass jars is an automaton and savage in Bulgakov's communist nightmare.I had a laugh here and there, and there's a glimmer of hope, however sarcastic, offered in \\"the Heavenly Kingdom,\\" but right through its cruel ending, the book has a misanthropic feel to it, and readers looking for a high-spirited roast might look elsewhere. It's not the gore and violence itself, because better writers--Dostoevsky immediately comes to mind--have demonstrated that genuine humor and darkness can coexist with devastating effect. Instead, it's the insanity of the situation combined with Bulgakov's cynicism, a combination that demotes Heart of a Dog from an outpouring of living, breathing characters to a mere statement.A powerful one, to be sure, but one that rings hollow to me."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"If nothing else, good political satire emerged from the old Soviet machine. Bulgakov and Vysotsky were brilliant.This is my favorite book of all time and I tend to read it again and again.

If you have read Bulgakov's masterwork, The Master and Margarita, then you know Bulgakov has no qualms with delving into the fantastic and unbelievable. Heart of a Dog is no exception, but the novella form keeps this book to a very neat size, where satire works best.Clearly in Bulgakov's sights was the socialist \\"support structure\\" that was in place at the time. Professor Preobrazhensky provides the best display of anti-soviet sentiment when he rages against \\"the general rack-and-ruin.\\" Having meetings and sitting around singing songs will do nothing to combat economic downfall. We could learn from that type of logic in our current state of rack-and-ruin.In this particular printing of the book, there are no frills as far as critiques or introductions, which is a bit disappointing for a story this short. Generally, it is nice to pad out these short novels with some background or discussion. Despite that shortcoming, the book is too good to deserve any less than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This book is fantastic. Bulgakov had something to say and he said it outright.

So I agree with the reviewers that think this novel is an easy reading.I give Heart of a Dog four stars just becuase I can't avoid comparing it to The Master and Margarita.

While is it specifically a satire on the USSR under communism, it also is a satire on human nature. Therefore, the book remains a gem after the failure of communism and the breakup of the USSR. The satire is built on an interplay of the distinctions (if any) between man and dog - and the dangers of being so self-confident as to blur that line. While satire often does not bear rereading, this book is well-structured and well-written - a favorite to return to."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Terrifically insightful, if something less than subtle. Bulgakov's genius for satire turns, again, upon the Soviet way of life. In retrospect, not exactly a moving target, but his came early, and displays considerably more insight than most of the others. A quick and humorous read, but lacking in both the scope and the depth of emotion that his &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; attained."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov's poignant satire of the Soviet man, made him a pariah in official literary circles of the Soviet Union. Sharikov, who is nothing but a cur becomes a human being who presumes to take a job on the purge committee in charge of getting rid of the udesirable social element, in this case, the cats.This brave allegory is one of Bulgakov's best works. The author came from a long line of Russian priests, was trained as a doctor, and gave up medicine to write full-time. He chose not to leave Russia after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, and led a rather miserable existence in Russia until his death in 1941. At least he avoided Stalin's purges. In this book, and in most others, Bulgakov shows his &quot;theological heritage&quot; by being very concerned with values, moral issues, and the like. The new man, whose advent was so loudly heralded by communists turned out to be a loutish, arrogant, semi-educated creature. This new man, with his old habits and simplistic views of life, assumes power and presumes to know how everybody should live. This is a well-executed allegory about one of the great tragedies of human history, when intellectual arrogance presumed to postulate the &quot;new man&quot; as false hope, as a promise of communist paradise on Earth."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"...or maybe, it's just the social difference. But this wonderful, biting, angry satire is really not... that... funny. Or rather, it is, but in a way that laughing at yourself can be. Not hillarious, not easy, not light, but with full realization of the horror that is going on.To begin with, Sharik the Dog is a wonderful, delightful animal. A real stray, the best of them--ready to serve and protect out of gratitude. Having been beaten, scalded, starved... imagine his joy when a nice-looking older gentleman takes him in, feeds him, bandages his scalded side. The poor thing is absolutely gratified. And really, just like Prof. Preobrazhensky says, Sharik is a very, very good dog.So how does a very, very good dog turns into an absolute horror of a human? Whoever said that Sharikov the man is semi-developed is just wrong--he is fully developed, and herein lies the nightmare. He walks. Talks. Apparently induces a young woman to have sex with him, having promised her marriage and lied that the surgical scar on his forehead is left from the Civil War. He works in the Oblava (the office dealing with the catching, killing and using as fur of the stray cats), but not so much out of necessity, rather because it answers his heart of a dog.Unfortunately, his hatred of cats is the only thing left from the adorable stray (who thought that he was unusually handsome and his granmother must have sinned with a Newfoundland). In all else, from his ridiculous, uneducated choice of a name, to the way he talks, to the lack of manners, to the Communist literature he reads, to his statements that the only way to solve the current situation is to \\"divide everything between those who have and those who have not\\"--in all of it, he is a quintessential proletariat man (the brain that was put into the dog came from a former alcoholic and prison inmate, Klim Chugunkin). The popular slogan of that era was Lenin's (I think) phrase that under the Soviet rule, a \\"kitchenmaid will rule the country\\". Well, it took us some seventy years to realize that a kitchenmaid shouldn't rule anything but a kitchen... Bulgakov saw it much earlier. His Sharikov is a terrifying portrait of what a member of lumpen-proletariat--a man without sense or education, common and base--becomes when he comes into relative power (at least over cats). To Russians, the image of Sharikov cannot be all that funny--after all, the inception of their state--their country, their life, their dark past--was intertwined inextricably with people like the late Klim Chugunkin (the last name means \\"wrought-iron\\"), aka P.P. Sharikov.The other characters in the book--the old Professor Preobrazhensky and the galant, gentlemanly young Dr. Bormental--are both of a disappearing bread. After the Revolution, People with Preobrazhensky's sensibilities came face to face with the necessity to leave their country. Preobrazhensky, however, a distinguished man of science, an experimental biologist, highly respected--is pretending that it is possible to have the life he had had prior to the Revolution. He has a cook and a maid, and an apartment of seven rooms (a considerable luxury)--all of which he needs: he operates in one, sees patients in another, sleeps in the third one, etc, etc. Already early in the book, he is facing an encroachment upon his property: the Building Committee is finding it \\"inequitable\\" that one man can take up seven whole rooms! In the book, Preobrazhensky simply throws them out (\\"I don't care how many rooms Isadora Duncan has! She can eat in the bedroom and slaughter rabbits in the dining-room!\\"): he has connections, he can afford to do so. Would he be able to do so in real life? God knows. It seems that Preobrazhensky's experiment strips him of all his comfort by bringing him face-to-face with the Revolution--he can no longer hide from seeing who has the power in his country: its personification is right there, at his very table, stinking of dead cats. By the end of the book, it is almost transparent that the Professor will leave Russia. As to Dr. Bormental, so steeped in the notions of honor, respect, decency--men like him were often doomed, in the great purges that had happened already and were to come in the 1930s.The book ends well--for the time being. The effects of the operation are reversed, and when Sharikov's friends, the House Committee, bring by the police, claiming that Preobrazhensky had murdered Sharikov, the Professor is able to produce him, still walking on hind legs, but already barely talking. The book concludes with Sharik the Dog thinking about how lucky he is to have found such a benefactor. I think that to fully appreciate the book, one must understand the bitterness with which its humor is suffused. It is funny, of course, but it is not light, by any means. Rather, it is poignant and sad."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This novel (a bit like Metamorphosis by Kafka) combines both an understanding of the turmoil of Russian society just after the Revolution of 1917 and enough humor to make you laugh well after you've put the book down. it's really hilarious. perhaps similar to metamorphosis, a stray dog is picked up by a famous scientis and given human organs. the dog takes on a semi-human appearance and learns to speak. In a sarchastic take on the how revolutions tend to fear thinking and critical minds, Bulgakov shows how easily mediocrity can raise your station in life in such an ideological climate. the 'Dog' becomes a party member and even manages to get the scientis in trouble with the authorities, while acquiring the self-importance of little minds. You don't have to be a student of ethics to appreciate this novel. just think of your supervisor and how he got to the top. This book is a far better analysis of 'climbing the ladder' than many specialized management books.By the way, to better appreciate the humor, it helps to know that many Russians took odd names after the revolution to honor the concept of the new man that was being inaugurated with by socialism. I've heard of gilrs being named Tractorina (yes after a tractor, symbol of modernized agricultural renewal). Just remember this point when you read what the man-dog decides to call himself."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov's Heart of a Dog deserves to be ranked among the greatest works of satirical writing in the 20th century. Unpublished for over 50 years, due to its harsh criticism of Stalinist Russia, this book is as relevant now as it was in 1925. Although some see in it a single-minded attack of the Socialist mindset, I believe that this view unfairly limits Bulgakov's work to a myopic ideological position. Instead, I believe that the book, through the lampooning of Sharik--a starving stray dog wandering the streets of Moscow, into a petty Marxist bureaucrat by the would be Dr Frankenstien, Philip Philippovich--illustrates the foolishness of blind adherence to any type of dogmatic belief system, rather that be Marxist, Capitalist or religious.If not, the comparison to Pavlov could not hold water because the entire point of conditioning a dog to react in a certain way to a given stimulus, was in the arbitrary nature of the stimulus involved. Thus, while explicitly representing a condemnation of the Stalinist regime, regardless of the terrible realities, Heart of a Dog is an implicit critique of the herd mentality, wherever it may be found. As it is, the mis-adventures of Sharik, as both unwanted dog and \\"common\\" man, represents a biting commentary of modernity-a time most rapt by dreams of a Utopian society born from technological achievement."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov entirely destroys the concept of Russian literature most of us got from college - dull, grey, plodding and intense. Instead, Bulgakov is witty, irreverent, fantastical and intensely colorful. The political implications of his works are so well intertwined with the stories that you can pay them intense attention or ignore them entirely as you choose. His plotlines are hilarious and just twisted enough to keep you guessing and surprised.While Master and Margarita is clearly his greatest work, Heart of a Dog is a brilliant short novel that provides a great introduction to not just Bulgakov, but to Soviet era Russian literature in general."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940) endured the difficult experience of having to live under the pressure of censorship, but has nonetheless left some interesting books that allow us to know what he thought about the process that has taking place in the newborn Soviet Russia. \\"Heart of a dog\\" is one of those books. It was written by Bulgakov in 1925, but it wasn\`t published in Soviet Russia until 1987, due to the fact that it can easily be interpreted as a critical satire regarding the URSS.\\"Heart of a dog\\" is the story of a stray dog, Sharik, that hasn\`t led an easy life. He lives in the streets of Moscow, and eats what he can, when he can. However, one day a doctor gives him food and takes him to his home. Sharik believes that his fate has changed, but he doesn\`t know that the doctor has rather strange intentions...The doctor wants to perform an experiment on Sharik, in order to learn what would happen if some human organs were transplanted to a dog. The doctor performs the operation, implanting in Sharik the pituitary gland and the testicles of a dead criminal. Against all odds, Sharik survives the operation, and from that moment on begins an extraordinary transformation, that makes him more and more human.But what kind of human is he?. Sharik can talk, and asks everybody to call him first \\"Mr. Sharikov\\", and afterwards \\"Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov\\". He also walks like a human being, and somehow resembles one... But can he think, or does he merely repeat what he hears, specially Marx\`s teachings?. Has the doctor\`s experiment ruined a perfectly good dog, making him a perfectly despicable \\"human\\" being that threatens to denounce counterrevolutionaries and chases cats?.I don\`t want to tell you more about this book: you really should read it yourself. It isn\`t long, but it is quite interesting. What is more important, it is open to many interpretations, and you can always find your own. Some people believe that for Bulgakov Sharik represented the failure of those who try to create new beings (exactly what was supposedly being done at that time in the URSS, with the \\"soviet man\\"). Others highlight the glimpses of Soviet society that \\"Heart of a dog\\" allows us to have, and think that the aim of the author was to give the reader at least an idea of what it was like to live in the URSS at that time...These few possible interpretations don't exclude others, so read this book and find them!!.

For the creation of the new man is still done with the same old faulty parts. Stalin was purported to say that the only way to create the new \\"Soviet Man\\" was to get rid of all the old ones (which he made a great try at, killing maybe 40 million or so over thirty years).Keeping in mind that Bulgakov, was born and educated under the Tsar and lived through WWI and then the Civil War, he understood who and what Russians were.

It deserve..."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"One of the most delightful aspects of Bulgakov's work, which was banned until well after his death, is the success with which he presents the workings and concerns of a dog's mind.Here's how the dog learned to hunt for food in post-revolutionary Moscow without a proper education and reading lessons:\\"After that, his learning proceeded by leaps and bounds. He learned the letter \`t' from \`Fish Trust' on the corner of Mokhovaya, and then the letter \`s' (it was handier for him to approach the store from the tail end of the word, because of the militiaman who stood near the beginning of \`Fish').\\"Tile squares set into corner houses in Moscow always and inevitably meant \`cheese.' A black samovar faucet over the word indicated the former owner of Chichkin's, piles of red Holland cheese, beastly salesmen who hated dogs, sawdust on the floor, and that most disgusting, evil-smelling Beckstein.\\"If somebody was playing an accordion, which was not much better than \`Celeste Aida,' and there was a smell of frankfurters, the first letters on the white signs very conveniently added up to the words \`no inde...,' which meant \`no indecent language and not tips.' In such places there were occasional messy brawls and people got hit in the face with fists, and sometimes with napkins or boots.\\"If there were stale hams hanging in a window and tangerines on the sill, it meant... Grr.... grr... groceries. And if there were dark bottles with a vile liquid, it meant...Wshi-w-i-wines...The former Yeliseyev Brothers.\\"You get the idea. The charm of \\"Heart of a Dog\\" lies in the simple sci-fantasy chosen by the author to regale us with true portraiture of life in the time and place with which it concerns itself, without ever appearing episodic, preachy, or issue-driven.The four paragraphs abstracted above move the story along, maintaining the humor (and pathos) involved in mapping a dog's mind, but also telling us something of the moment's popular music, of the behavior that could be witnessed on the city streets, and rendering a street economy that one would assume is a thing of the past.But the narrative, in the end, is not entitled \\"Mind of Dog.\\" It is \\"Heart of a Dog,\\" and soon we move beyond the concerns of the canine, to those of the larger cast assembled by the author to make certain points about the reorganization of Russian life into soviet structures and concepts.Truly revolutionary.The dog is taken in off the street by Doctor Philip Philippovich Preobrazhensky who, even in the leveling times he was tapped to live, is a man of prestige and means.\\"Heart of a Dog,\\" falls clearly into the category of satire and, as such, spares no one.Preobrazhensky is up to no good with some scary eugenic operations that are enhancing the vitality and sexual capacity for some of Moscow's wealthier denizens. When the communist housing committee comes to bust his chops about the size of his apartment and the new times which the doctor must reconcile himself to, he makes a call to one of his patients, influential in the recently imposed Bolshevik order, that results in the committee delegates leaving his place with tails between their legs.But Philip Philipovich's time will come.The dog, whom he and his helper Bormenthal have dubbed \\"Sharik\\" is startled from the peaceful life in the too-big-apartment he could hardly believe luck had placed him, to have the brain stem of a deceased common criminal grafted onto his own.The experiment goes awry and Sharik slowly morphs into a man; a complicated man with opinions, desires, and an appetite for cats - a man with a dog's heart that the doctors Preobrazhensky and Bormenthal are ill-equipped to control.He smokes, has no sense of social correctness, hits on the resident young girl Zina, and has a wise-guy's mouth to boot. \\"An exceptional scoundrel,\\" in Preobrazhensky's words.Disdained and pushed to the margins by the bourgeois technicians who created him, Sharik does what came naturally to people (or dogs) in those days. He becomes a communist and gets \\"papers\\" attesting to his officially recognized existence as Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharik.He gets a good job in the municipal department, purging cats, and finally forces the hand of Philip Philippovich by again springing the local aparatchiks on him over the size of his apartment and the way its space is apportioned.Pushed to the brink, the doctors do something to Sharik, it is not clear what, that returns him to the state of grateful mongrel in which he originally entered the premises.We can view this story as a commentary on the open-ended fear the aspirations of science and modernity imposed upon people at the turn of the last century. It can also be savored as a parable on Soviet life as it seemed shortly after the revolution.Okay, the scribe doesn't really know what a parable is, he just wanted to sound lit-critical for a second.Perhaps the better expression is \\"analogy\\" or even, \\"metaphor.\\" the scribe thinks that these words along with \`simile' and a few others only serve to slice the same ham a lot of thin ways and that they should come up with a better, all purpose, word to meet the utilitarian tone of our times.In any case, it's clear Bulgakov had an ironic view of the Bolshevik order and the underlying idea of sweeping away all that had come before to replace it with something more egalitarian. We don't get a sense he was against it on principles, rather that he was mortified by what happened when it was applied to a giant and backward czarist peasant state.the scribe's sense is that he is saying a dog's a dog, and a prole's a prole, regardless of what rational experiment, social or scientific, you expose them, too.There will always be, Bulgakov seems to be saying, complicated matters of the heart that surpass the grasp of even our most enlightened and talented citizens.Post-revolutionary Russia is now a ways off. We do not know what song the doctor is always singing, \\"from Granada to Seville...\\" and so we miss its cultural significance and what it means to come out of Preobrazhensky's mouth as well.Still, the literature transports us.The version read by the scribe (Grove Press) is translated by Mirra Ginsburg. Translations are always tricky. We can only hope they approximate what the original language was cleverly employed to convey. Ginsburg recreates an over-the-top type of nineteenth century idiom in the tone of, let's say, G.K. Chesterton (\\"The Club of Queer Trades\\").\\"My good sir, I will not be made a guy of with this preposterous...\\"Maybe, hopefully, that is what Bulgakov had in mind. To be sure, the high-flown pompousness of his hosts certainly contrasts with the low-flung desires and needs of the proletarian dog.Woof."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I've read this book several times. It's a short read - it's also hysterical (in a cynical sort of way, beware). I was introduced to the works of Mikhail Bulgakov in the mid-90s, and, after devouring Master and Margarita, I just had to read this one.I won't give away the plot - it's been described in mulitple other reviews. But the idea of a man-dog smoking a cigar and wearing suspenders always makes me laugh 'til I nearly pee. It's a great book. But you must have a dry sense of humor to fully appreciate it!!Read this and then read other Bulgakov books. It is understandable why Soviet Russia would have banned him during his time. What a shame, as he was truly an incredibly gifted author!"},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This novel, written by the Soviet writer Mikhail Bulagakov, in 1925, is a satirical science fiction novel. The subject of the satire is the Communist ideology and bureaucracy as well as the petty bourgeoisie that they oppose. However, Bulgakov develops an even deeper theme relating to human nature and human culture.Professor Preobazhensky is a flagrantly decadent bourgeois character who does all he can to resist the leveling of the Communist Revolution, maintaining a relatively luxurious lifestyle while young radicals, like Shvonder are trying to carry out their revolutionary leveling policies.Shvonder insists that Preobazhensky give up several rooms of his apartments and give them to other individuals in the spirit of the revolution.Shvonder then threatens to complain to higher authorities, implying that force would be used if needed. Preobazhensky refuses and is actually the first to use a kind of force by using his influence with the apparently corrupt Communist bureaucracy to maintain his lifestyle. He calls Party officials and tells them that he will no longer perform operations to help Party officials if Shvonder is allowed to divide up the apartment. Shvonder is called to the phone and apparently ordered to back off.As the novel proceeds, Preobazhensky is further fleshed out as a sort of mad scientist character. He undertakes a dramatic experiment in which he transplants the pituitary gland and testes of a male human into a stray dog, Sharik. In a Kafkaesque transformation, this dog, Sharik, is transformed into a sort of human. He is only \\"sort of human\\" in the sense that once he appears human, he still retains the \\"heart of a dog\\" or more accurately we might say in English the \\"soul\\" of a dog. At least, this is the reader's first interpretation of the new Sharik, soon to be re-christened \\"Sharikov.\\"The plot of the novel is developed by the complications arising from this experiment. Preobazhensky had set out prove that the intelligence of humans is located in the pituitary (and testes?) and that this can be successfully transplanted--even to another animal, like a dog. Thus, if a dog were to receive a human pituitary, he would develop the intelligence of a human. At first, the experiment seems to be a stunning success. Sharik(ov) even develops the ability to speak and read.Unfortunately, the professor finds out that there is a downside to the transplantation. Along with human capabilities he has also transplanted the degenerate character of the donor. Sharik(ov)'s character develops as a degenerate human character. This is due, of course, to the fact that the \\"donor\\" human was the low-life, bar-brawling scoundrel, Klim Chugunkin.Later in the novel, having fully having experienced this downside in his subject, Preobazhensky, despairs of his efforts. The allure of eugenics no longer enthralls him. It is nothing but a blind alley. The human race can only be improved through the slow, gradual process of natural evolution--in no other way.Dr. Bromenthal answers his colleague's despair by asking Preobazhensky, \\"But what if it were Spinoza's brain\\" that had been transplanted? Wouldn't the transplantation then have been worthwhile? Preobrazhensky answers \\"no.\\" No, it would not have been necessary, he explains, because every day the world produces Spinozas out of ordinary women. The point is, nature needs no help in producing Spinozas. In the course of its evolution, Preobazhensky explains, the human race \\"creates dozens of outstanding geniuses who adorn the earth, stubbornly selecting them out of the mass of scum.\\"Of course, the whole attempt to \\"remake\\" a creature is also suggestive of the Communists' idea of remaking man into Soviet Man - and of remaking the crude and ignorant peasants and workers into proletarians fully aware of their class, their class power, and of the class struggle.We can hear the author's voice in Preobazhensky's observation that torture or force cannot be used to change human nature or human society. This is a clear statement of the theme of the novel. The Communists can transform neither individuals nor entire classes through the forcible methods that they are employing. The only results of such attempts will be violence and chaos.This violence and the resulting chaos is produced by Sharik, who begins by demanding the first name and patrynomic of Polygraph Polygraphovich and the appropriate surname of Sharikov (son of Sharik), which he truly is. The man Sharikov, who is described as somewhat physically deformed or at least incompletely formed, acts out a parallel deficient moral character. He becomes the low-life character that his human donor was--stealing, chasing women, lying, exploiting, mooching, exhibiting cruelty and prejudice, etc.Of course Sharik's name is emblematic. He is a \\"polygraph\\" in the sense that he is telling the truth that the author Bulgakov is trying to tell--literally recording the truth as the writing of the novel is read by the reader.The only way some semblance of order can be restored and the main conflict of the novel resolved is by removing the transplanted organs from Sharikov and giving him back is own organs. As a restored dog, Sharik again finds his natural place; and all is once again relatively peaceful, as peaceful, perhaps, as anything can be in this world.And so humanity will have to wait patiently for its next Spinoza, and by extension, it will also have to wait patiently for its era of deliverance from the darkness of past ages. Social progress is a story of evolution not revolution, and evolution is a very slow process, barely discernable in the lifetime of any single individual.At the end of the novel, we see the \\"stubborn, persistent\\" Preobazhensky at it again, pulling brains out of jars, \\"searching for something all the time, cutting, examining, squinting and singing...\\" Hadn't Preobazhensky learned his lesson? Perhaps he had, for a brief time. But the mind of science, the reductionist element in our dominant Western culture can't just leave it alone. Bulgakov sees this as the enduring danger against which we must be on constant guard. We murder to dissect. We have trouble going with the flow--seeing the big picture and not being open to the wisdom it can give us."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Heart of a Dog is a most insightful book into the Russian soul, and Bulgakov proves himself to be another brilliant Russian satirist. It was great fun to read of the Bolshevik era in this common Russian theme, with its bizarre appearances of the \\"loyal comrades\\" upstairs. One of the great Bolshevik era writers. If one considers the dog to be the common Russian, who was attemptedly educated to be of a higher class, the monster he became rings a familiar note looking at Putin's Russia right now.The dissonance between classes was pronounced in the pre revolutionary era, as now, and does not change with the poltical winds, it seems to this author, despite the huge variation in political rulers and philosopies over the last 100 years. An interesting, quick and fun read. Highly recommended, especailly to those with a history of reading Russian novels."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Censored by the state apparatus, there are a number of targets in this satire. As much a social satire in the vein of Metamorphosis or science Frankenstein; he concludes the base wants of food and beer are not so much different than the base wants of a respectable doctor- a large apartment. Power and control are are illustrated in several different ways."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"What a wonderful book! Funny, ascerbic and critical of the Soviet regime, Bulgakov writes an amusing tale that is easy to read, with an obvious message.The book remains delightfully readable 70 years after it is written - this is a book you will enjoy, not a book you 'should' read."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Some do, but for ex-soviet people the humanized dog turning into the proletarian and going against his creator is rather sad. You will indeed enjoy the irony and great satire of this early Bulgakov work, especially if you are familiar with Master and Margarita."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"One of my favorite novels. You can nearly feel 1920s Moscow reading this marvellous book, which is not only bitingly funny but a subtle portrait of the place and time. Walking down Prichistenka Street you can hear the echo of Sharik's bark. I actually prefered this novel to the more famed Master and Margerita. Equally essential for any student of Russian culture or any fan of satire."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov's novel is a farce based on the Soviet 'experiment' with its citizens. Rather than read the populous and create a socialist union that would fit early twentieth century Russia, the Bolsheviks attempted to create a society of conscientious political workers. But the lack of education and the inherent crudeness of the raw material that was the 'masses' made the experiment's failure inevitable. Polygraph Polygraphovich, born a dog, is surgically transformed into the quintessential soviet man--opportunistic and petty. In reading Heart of a Dog, one cannot help but feel the unfulfilled potential of the Russian Revolution. Bulgakov's masterful subtleties elucidate the Soviet thirties as a decade of a dying nation, when Stalinist theory negated the 1917 Revolution"},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This was an enjoyable little book, though after the wild, breathtaking ride that was _Master &amp; Margarita_, this book for me was something of a let-down. If you are unaquainted with Bulgakov or have never read his magnum opus, _Master &amp; Margarita_, do yourself a favor and read _Heart of A Dog_ FIRST. If you like it, go on to _M&amp;M_. If you DONT, go on to _M&amp;M_ anyway. _Heart of A Dog_ is one of Bulgakov's earlier works, he was still developing as a writer when he wrote it. _M&amp;M_ is shows him at his absolute best. _Heart of A Dog_ is a good book in its own right, but it kind of suffers from standing in _M&amp;M_'s shadow, at least for me it did."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"'Could animals became human?' is just the reverse of thequestion which Bulgakov could not put down living inthe stalinist Russia: 'How come humans could becameanimals?'

I hardly ever read something simmilarexept, perhaps, the swiftian 'modest proposal'."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Love dogs. Love Russian history. Love the idea of a book written from perspective of a dog with an eye on a pivotal point in Russian history. That's what this book is! Didn't love this book. The first part's a bit compelling for the very reasons I'd hoped it would be. Then, it dives into a tedious metaphor about communism and humanity that is a bit gross and dull. Probably seemed radical in its day. Now, just odd and dull."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This book (if you've seen the other reviews you already know this) is laugh out loud. The scenes in the book are created simply as a comedy, and no one can present like Bulgakov can. However, don't be fooled. This book won't knock you over with it's stunning insight or split second timing. It is simply a short, whacky tale of a dog gone wrong - in human form. Pick it up and breeze through it. It's very entertaining and is an easy read."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov's quibble with the Soviet authorities seems not to be that they have come to realise that the lower classes are ghastly, but that they ever supposed they could be anything else. I'm sure the dicky-bowed, monacled MB would have been happier as a Parisian boulavadier, aristo-emigre. Funny, decadent, thoroughly counter-revolutionary - its scarcely surprising he was supressed during his lifetime."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This sat on my shelf for about a year. I purchased it because I had enjoyed the author's competent but not earth-shaking \\"Master and Margarita.\\"Unfortunately, when I finally finished it (in an afternoon: it's only 120 pages) it became one of those books that was a lot better before you have actually read it.I knew what it was about, of course: a Soviet era satire (written in 1925, but not published in the USSR until 1987) about a dog who, owing to the experiments of a scientist, gets the opportunity to enjoy life as a human -- and low-level party functionary -- for a while.Alas! Before I read it, the satire was dead on, the characterization sharp, and the story was \\"brilliantly inventive,\\" as the back cover promises.But that's not actually how the story turns out to be.In fact, the first third of the novel concerns the dog's point of view: what it's like to be a stray dog in a Russian city. I didn't find this part to be particularly memorable or exceptional.Then we get to the part where the professor transforms the dog into a human. This took way too long: probably the middle half of the novel or so. We were certainly halfway through before he was actually in a human body.Bulgakov definitely spent too much time on this process, and it blunted the strength of this satire, in my view. I mean, come on. Your readers have already charitably agreed to suspend their disbelief so that they can enjoy the story of a dog walking around in human form, so why was it necessary to go on and on for the bulk of the novel trying to convince us this was scientifically possible?The whole satire doesn't really get going until the final quarter of the book, but by then, what can Bulgakov do? He has squandered so much time setting up the story that there is little room left for character development or complication.In fact, by the end of the book, Bulgakov seems to be wink-winking at us, \\"Get it? Low-level Soviet officials are indistinguishable from dogs! Get it? Get it?\\"That's it?Have our standards of a satire really fallen to the point where such heavy-handed clunkiness can pass for deft and timeless wit? Sheesh."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Placed within the boundaries of post revolutionary Russia (October revolution 1917) this novel with its dark atmosphere pierces deeply into bones of a reader, leaving him amazed and stunned with a size to which can escalate human stupidity, and evilness and unintelligent behaviour by following the paths of some greater revoultion, of some welfare for all.By walking the alleys of Moscow, professor Petar Petrovic Preobrazensky comes across a wanderrer dog, and after feeding him, he performs an operation on him, in which he combines part of a dead man body (dead man is alchocolic, violent, and member of communist party)with the parts of a dog.What is caused by operation is already presented in some other novels like 'Frankestein' but here (considering that this is Bulgakov and all...) is totaly unexpected. Dog starts to transform, slowly at first, into a human being whose parts he now posesses. What becomes apparent in the process are all the bad thing one can have when &quot;suffering&quot; from a posession of a human heart. He losses all nobility of a dog, ant transforms himself into a man that he used o be before, with all negative sides that remained.Association with the president of House Comitee Svonde, will lead to major problems.Bulgakov uses his famous, fluid style, not allowing break beetween narration and dialogue, though short this novel keeps his reader glued to his chair, and doesn't allow him to leave mists of post revolutionary Moscow, mists of human spirit (in which was believed that by mere act of revolting (violent), all became different than it used to be, neglecting the fact that people that used to live under empire are the same people the now live under Lenin)Though somewhat flawish on some places, with weak links between objects and verbs, with holes in some spaces, that should (or could) be filled with more detailed narration, this novel stands side by side with the rest of Bulgakov's work.Thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Grab onto this novel with two fists, and hold on tight. &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; is a biting satire, at once mocking Russian medicine, the next the Bolshevik party.

If you have any interest in satire, or absurd humor, &quot;Heart of a Dog,&quot; is a gem."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I was 18 years old preparing for the entrance examinations for the university in Greece. I could not stay up late at nights going to parties or discos because I had to wake up early in the morning to study. There was only one solution for entertainment: theater.Athens, Greece, has a very cultural life style and there are more than 60 to 70 theaters with live performances. I bought the newspaper of the day and chose a play. It was &quot;The heart of a dog&quot; by some russian writer named Bulgakov. The leading actor was Greece's most famous actor at the time Georgos Kimoulis. I said what the heck, I cant go wrong with him, lets hope that it is a good play -it was the first time I would go to the theater.At the end of the play I was a new man. It was an experience that changed my life. What a play. So powerfull, so romantic, nostalgic, humorous, full of irony and sarcasm. The play was dealing about the efforts of the new &quot;goverment&quot; to creat the &quot;perfect man&quot;. It made me think: what does it mean ? a perfect man ? I was amazed by the indirect way that Bulgakov treated the subject. It was like he was laughing at the face of the political leaders of the time without never naming names or saying things with their name. Only later I learned that he paid a heavy price for this irony.The atmosphere was surreal. Now I can understand it. It was pure surrealism, the man transforming to a dog, the bureaucrats the dialogues...I was so much captivated by the atmosphere of the early revolutionary Russia described by Bulgakov, such a mysterious time and place, that for a long time I was only selecting plays by Russian authors -I even wanted to visit Russia but the fall of the communist regime changed my plans.Bulgakov made me a theater-addict for life. Immediately after the performance I bought the script of the play and read it. So tasteful, it was excellent. And then of course I carried on with Bulgakovs masterpiece &quot;the master and margarita&quot; which until today, many years later, is the best piece of literature that I have ever read. Now I live in New York and I often go to Brodway and off-Broadway plays. Nothing compares with the feelings of &quot;the heart of a dog&quot;. And every time that the lights go dim, before the play starts, I always think of that play that started it all for me. The heart of a dog. A triumph. A masterpiece. Such a same that Bulgakov had to go through the terror of the people that did not understand him - or to put it correctly, from the peole that really understood him......"},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I am very angry.

Russian literature has such incredible precedents - how d'you compare with Tolstoy, old Dostoy, Turgenev? But Heart of a Dog knocked me for six. Laugh out loud funny, the dog-creation ranks with Papa Karamazov as a ghastly comic character you can't help having a sneaking affection for. It's the perfect short novel, that you'll want to read again and force onto a friend, guaranteed. Unless you're a cat lover."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov is simply irresistible - when you start reading the book &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; be sure you have five or fix straight hours free ahead because once you start you cannot stop till the end. Mirra Ginsburg's translation is good but again please do not expect &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; or &quot;Steinbeck&quot; from the translation. Before starting we have to remember this book was published in 1925 when the Bolshevic revolution was at its prime and talking against the authorities almost meant certain death - as happened in the case of Gogol. In 1925 Bulgakov predicted the fall of the communist empire but that does not mean he is terribly fond of the Tzcarian rule. A dog called &quot;Sharik&quot; - who represent the oppressed class before the 1917 revolution is transformed to &quot;Sharikov&quot; - the comrade whose only source of knowledge is his mentor &quot;&quot;Shvonder&quot; another comrade of the new age. This is satire at its best as the comrades make fun of earlier generation, even their own creators, everything is getting destroyed in the name of equality. When &quot;Sharikov&quot; goes after the cat and in the process destroys the whole apartment shows how the revolution went after the few individuals to destroy the whole country - the destruction of the Persian carpets symbolize the destruction of the heritage which is almost impossible to rebuild. The change in names is also quite remarkable &quot;Polygraph Polygraphovich&quot; probably represents the measured relation between truth and the existence of &quot;Sharikov&quot; - his physical presence is the truth but the lack of papers again contradicts that truth. It is like a polygraph test just that &quot;Shariov&quot; has to be physically present to attest to the fact that he exists. The young rebellious group is out to destroy not with a cause but just to establish their power. Again it is not that Bulgakov has left the old house untouched - he shows their love for authority and reluctance to share some of the authorities with the new age people. They live in supreme luxury and try to justify it and if they are not successful in doing so then they resort to brutal power to neutralize the new age. In the final chapters the transformation of the man back to a dog probably symbolizes the fall of communism."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I have to echo the reviews that are critical of this particular edition.

It presents the reader with a critical commentary on the state of the society (primarily its cultural development) in the Soviet Union. Perhaps the most important question that the author tries to answer in this book is as follows, \\"What does it take to be a human being?\\""},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"From a native Russian speaker, just a few remarks which hopefully will help you understand the book better:1. Professor Preobrazhensky is modeled on professor Pavlov (of the salivating dogs fame), who himself is well known for a few remarks such as &quot;for the kind of experiment the Communists are conducting on Russia I wouldn't sacrifice even a frog&quot; and &quot;a revolution is not an excuse for being 20 minutes late for work&quot; (to a lab assistant who got caught in street shooting).2. The book lashes out - VIOLENTLY - at working class, at lumpenproletariat (and in Soviet Russia these two terms were dangerously close for much of the 20th century). Please remember that when you're reading about Sharikov - the caricature of a heavily-drinking, crude Soviet worker (if you've ever spent time in small industrial towns in Russia, you'll be able to understand this book easily)3. Sharik is a cliche nickname for dogs in Russia (something like Spot). Sharikov is akin to a dog taking the last name Spotter for himself.4. Polygraph Polygraphovich sounds as ridiculous in English as it does in Russian :)Some of my anglophone friends had problems with this 1925 book. Just trying to be helpful..."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov, best known for his brilliant novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; was steeped in the theatrical craft. When his books were censored, he wrote a wild, heartfelt letter to authorities in Soviet Russia, asking that, if they were not to be allowed to publish his work, would they then assign him to work in theater, even as a lowly stagehand. In one of Stalin's capricious moves, Bulgakov was, indeed, assigned to work as an assistant director at a Moscow theater.Meanwhile, Bulgakov continued to amass what must be one of the world's great hordes of literary work unpublished in the lifetime of an author. &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; is probably his most viciously anti-Soviet, anti-Proletariat work, and it reads like a cross between Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; but with Bulgakov's intense sarcasm and humor thrown in. The book is so dramatic, it's almost impossible to read it without seeing it run like a film or play behind your eyes as you read it.A professor (whose Russian name is a play on the scientist Pavlov) adopts a mongrel dog. The dog Sharik (Fido, Rover...) is grateful! His life on the street has been hard, he's been kicked, scalded with hot water and he is starving. The professor feeds him well. Ah, he's gaining weight and healing up. What a nice man! A god, even, well, to a dog. But wait a minute! The professor, noted surgeon that he is, is preparing to operate. He seizes the dog....And then we see the results of the professor's cruel experiment. A dog gets a human brain portion and begins to develop as a human. But he isn't a nice friendly, tail-wagging human. Oh, no. He's low, a cur, yes, a dog of a man who chases cats uncontrollably, pinches women's bottoms and drinks like a fish (oops mixed metaphor there.) He demands to be registered and get papers like a human being in Soviet society. And the authorities are anxious, even rabid to assist him. Sharikov takes a first name and patronymic that is so inappropriate, so hysterically funny that you have to laugh out loud. Then he gets a prominent job as a purge director, eliminating those counter-revolutionary cats from Moscow's pure Communist society. That is, until the professor cooks up a plot.This is a gem of a book. Bulgakov shares Orwell's deep hatred of totalitarianism, but unlike the delicate satire of Orwell, Bulgakov writes with massive belly laughs of deeply sarcastic humor and over-the-top jokes. He's a dramatist at heart, and this book shows his theatrical thinking, where exaggerated movement and stage props play as much a role in exposition as dialog.This is a true small masterpiece and should appeal to just about anyone. It would be a very good book for a high school or college literature study. It is really wonderful, and prepares the reader for Bulgakov's wildly out of control masterpiece &quot;Master and Margarita.&quot; Don't miss this book for anything!"},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"It's just something about those Russians. I guess because they've had to put up with so much turmoil, for so long, historically; or it could be those long Russian winters; but for whatever reason they have produced a steady stream of excellent satirists for the past two hundred years.

Leskov's narrator, Vatahvskov, states in a conversation amongst his colleagues that the feature most singular in Russian society is &quot;its abundance of unpleasant surprises.&quot;Which brings me to Bulgakov and to HEART OF A DOG, for it is a novella full of &quot;unpleasant surprises,&quot; both happening to and instigated by, Bulgakov's singular literary creation, Sharik (aka Mr. Sharik, aka Citizen Sharikov, aka Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov, commisar of cat control, etc.) Bulgakov takes an absurd situation (think of Gogol's &quot;nose&quot; wandering around the streets of St. Petersburg for comparison) and crafts it into a wonderful parody of the societal madhouse that was 30s Moscow under the party's intolerable decrees. His is a portrait of political correctness run amok. Citizen Shvonder, the representation of all things banal about the collectivist mentality of the era is the Bulgakov's primary target in this regard. His jealous rage at the fact that professor Phillipov is living the high life, while he and his ilk are sharing one room apartments, remains comically ineffectual. It was Bulgakov's way at getting back at all of the party appartchiks that were in fact causing him a great deal of consternation and physical hardship at the time.A reviewer who was critical of this work as being too much akin to a Chagall painting was drawing an accurate analogy. Yet, coming from a perspective in which magical realism has become an accepted literary technique, I don't consider that a drawback. It is part of the same Russian tradition. The fanciful and the grotesque have long been an integral part of Russian fiction. Bulgakov is simply one of its more famous and adept practitioners.BEK"},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov was a true Russian genius, but one who lacked the \\"politically correct\\" postures of other less talented soviet hacks. As a result, his works were nearly unknown in his lifetime. But gradually, his books have been published and translated and with each book his stature grows. Bulgakov may stand with Myakovsky, Mandelstam, Akmatova, Shostakovitch and Malevich as the greatest artistic minds to come from the Soviet Union.The Heart of a Dog is a great book, perhaps not as multifaceted as Bulgakov's masterpiece, Master and Margarita, but brilliant nonetheless. The book seems perhaps a combination of Gogol's The Nose, and Kafka's Metamorphosis. Sharik - a perfectly normal stray dog is adopted by a famous scientist who transplants the testes and pituitary gland of criminal. Sharik gradually develops into a lewd, drunken cur of a man who is fabulously successful in the new Soviet society.As Joanna Daneman says in a previous review, Bulgakov's theatrical background is highly visible in this work. Each chapter is crafted like a distinct scene...the comedy is often extremely broad. Sharik is as pointed and broad a caricature of The New Soviet Man...as seen from it's dark underbelly. Many of the scenes are almost broad slapstick. And yet, the humor, while broad, is also quite bitter. It is obvious that Bulgakov saw the deterioration of his society and was deeply disturbed by it.Bulgakov's disdain of the Proletariat is a bit disturbing to an American. After all, we are the country of the common man. And there is a hidden \\"snobbery\\" in the work, which can be a bit hard to take. But so much of the book is dead on...and it is extremely funny. Heart of a Dog is an enjoyable and important addition to the growing Bulgakov oeuvre."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This is a dramatization written by Frank Galati and based on the book by Bulgakov.

This fanciful tale of an unfortunate street dog transformed, against its own will, into a drunken and vice-laden human monstrosity, closely parallels the fitful and savage conversion of the Russian Empire and its peoples into the Soviet Union and its subjects. When said dog, Sharik, first makes his appearance in the tale, he is indeed a quite sympathetic and homely creature; battered from a harsh life on the streets and suffering from the wounds inflicted upon him by a well-to-do chef, Sharik is nonetheless capable of great empathy, as evidenced by his feelings of sorrow for an underpaid and overdependent typist. Although Sharik is initially much afflicted by his wounds, one can sense a decisive mentality of perseverance in this hapless and battered, yet overwhelmingly grateful and obedient, animal. Sharik, thus, symbolizes aptly the Russian people as they stood prior to the Bolshevik Revolution. Hungry, abused, and left destitute by a cold bourgeois society that cared little for their well-being, the Russian, much like Shark, nonetheless remained unbroken in spirit and consistently persevered through their difficulties while maintaining their unique mindset and wit. Yet, just as Sharik was pushed to his limit of persistence by his scalding, so to were the Russian by the hardships of the second World War; in both cases, these battered would would likely have perished had it not been for the arrival of charismatic and empathetic leaders, whom they, in their destitution, would follow blindly to their ultimate detriment. Just as many Russians rallied behind Lenin and his promises of peace, land, and bread, so too did Sharikov throw in his lot with Professor Preobrazhensky, a seemingly kindly doctor who took pity on the suffering dog.Professor Philip Philipovich Preobrazhensky, literally \\"Professor Transformation\\" in the original Russian, presents a unique dilemma for the critic attempting to assess his character and actions; on the one hand, it is simple to view him in light of his charity to Sharik, while, on the other hand, his cold betrayal of the dog coupled with his questionable morality significantly blacken his character. Indeed, the Professor, who appeared at first to adopt Sharik simply out of some goodness of heart, had truly done so in order to use the poor mut as the subject of his experiments; after fattening up Sharik, the Professor quickly betrays his trust and sets about forcibly altering him. In this, one can discern a certain similarity with the behavior of the Bolsheviks, who upon gaining the trust of certain of the Russian people with their promises, ultimately brought upon them immense suffering as they attempted to force them into the Communist mold. The operation in which the Professor transplants a human pituitary gland into Sharik is depicted in such violent and grisly terms as to only be a criticism of the \\"operation\\" that was the Bolshevik Revolution. Just as the Professor \\"treacherously\\" cut and prodded Sharik in molding him into a man, so too did the Bolsheviks impose much bloodshed and carnage upon the Russian during the Revolution and subsequent civil war. Indeed, the entire gruesome operation sequence, combined with base nature and the resultant human Sharikov, speak loudly to Bulgakov's underlying criticism of the Bolsheviks hasty and brutal methods of imposing Communism upon the nation. Similarly damning to the character of the Professor is his seeming moral indifference and unwillingness to accept the results of his own cruel actions. In performing the experiment upon Sharikov, the Professor knew nothing of what would result; he did so merely out of cold scientific uncaring. Yet, when the result was the drunken Poligraph Ploigraphovich, the Professor exhibited no tolerance for his own creation, constantly berating him instead of more patiently bearing the responsibility of his actions. When the Professor's assistant suggests murdering Sharikov, the Professor refuses only out of a desire to keep his hands clean of crime; such poor morality does not speak well for him. His refusal to abandon his bourgeois lifestyle, which inevitably leads to conflict with the Soviet authorities, presents not only his stubbornness and corruption, but also his possibly noble refusal to submit to a cause which he does not hold dear.In sharp contrast with the more nuanced and ambiguous Professor, Poligraph Poligraphovich Sharikov, as the dog becomes know after his transformation into a man, represents all that is worst in human nature, as well as the nascent Soviet mentality. From the beginning, Sharikov is portrayed as hopelessly vulgar, impetuous, ungrateful, and drunken. Not afraid to lie, he invents tales of war heroism to woo a coworker; when this dishonesty is exposed, he shows himself to be vengeful, vowing to have the woman's pay docked. Perhaps more significantly, Sharikov quickly becomes a staunch, mindless, devotee to the local Communist leader, Shvonder; to the Professor's disgust, he begins using terms like \\"Comrade\\" and speaking of the division of property. It is with this that Bulgakov makes his biting attack upon the corruption already apparent in the Communist lifestyle of the Soviet Union. Aside from being a drunken monstrosity, Sharikov also only half-heartedlt accepts the Communist ideals he so loudly espouses, as revealed by his refusal to register for military service. It is with the generally disagreeable character of Sharikov that Bulgakov illustrates best the ungodly and corrupted beast that the Revolution had transformed Russia into; though not overtly anti-Soviet, Bulgakov does not fear exposing the rot of the Soviet system. In a prophetic statement that Bulgakov could never have understood at the time, the Professor foresees that Sharikov, brute as he is, represents just as much of a threat to the Communists as he does to the Professor and his well-being; this succinct remark foreshadows the depraved and mindless purges carried out by Stalin against the Communist Party itself. In realizing the overall pointlessness of the ability to transform a man into a dog when nature itself is capable of creating great men at any time, the Professor profoundly comments upon the mistake of forcing a Communist revolution upon Russia, when Marx had urged that such a transformation would occur naturally; in ultimately reversing the procedure and changing Sharikov back into a dog, it is possible to identify an exhortation to reverse the botched Bolshevik Revolution. However, Bulgakov was too careful and canny an author to jeopardize his life or liberty by so overtly criticizing the Soviet regime, and as a result, \\"The Heart of a Dog\\" is an intentionally multi-faced and ambiguous novel, which may be interpreted in numerous fashions."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Completed by Bulgakov in 1925, this short story remained unpublished in the Soviet Union for almost sixty years. When it finally appeared on Soviet bookshelves in 1987 it became an instant hit and is arguably seen as on of the author's most hard-hitting novels. Not for nothing did Stalin's censors deem this book too sensitive for publication.\`The Heart of a Dog' is the absurd story of a stray dog, who is taken in from the streets by a well-known, well-off Professor named Philip Philipovich Preobrazhensky in order that he may attempt a groundbreaking operation; the transplantation of human testicles and pituitary gland into the dog. The operation is successful; however the Professor has produced an intolerable being which resembles a human of revolutionary sentiment with a dog-like penchant for chasing cats.The story is enjoyable in and of itself, and one must congratulate Bulgakov for his imagination and inventiveness - forced upon him by the oppressive intellectual climate of his time - in thinking up such a tale. In addition, It is very easy to read and interesting for its portrayal of the atmosphere in a bourgeois household in 1920s Moscow. There are also a number of other levels to the book and various interpretations of what Bulgakov's true message was. It is worth noting, for example, that Professor Preobrazhensky's name is a derivative of the Slavic word for \`transfiguration', and the book is ostensibly about failed attempts to improve upon human nature. Thus, Bulgakov may be seen to be either ridiculing Soviet attempts to create communist supermen or attacking science's interference with nature. Finally, another interpretation of the story sees it as a parable of the 1917 Revolution in which things were set into motion which became almost uncontrollable.\`The Heart of a Dog' is a classic story of great intellectual value, which deserves to be read and which is immensely enjoyable for its absurdity, humour, and political message(s)."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I really enjoyed this, but I wasn't aware that there was both a play and a novel until I found out that it was the novel I was supposed to read for class.

It says that NOWHERE in the description. Just a heads up."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"I enjoyed this book as a very entertaining story - the grotesque elements are fun, clever ideas and I can see the political engagement.But - of all the characters in the book, I found the arrogant pompous professor and his bullying assistant by far the most unsympathetic individuals in the novel. If you asked me who were the main targets of the satire, I would not say it was the Soviets / Communists, but those like the professor who thought that humanity could be improved by rational / scientific means, and with kindness rather than cajoling.Of course there is satire directed against the housing committee for their singing and bureaucatic pedantry - but the self righteous over civilisation and pseudo sophistication of the professor seem much more objectionable. I think I would become an argumentative Sharik if I had been taken from my perfectly natural life as a dog and told I must suddenly conform to the petty social norms advocated my the professor. Although he begins by saying that there should be no violence against the dog or the man, Sharik is frequently beaten, and in the end, any humanity he may have possessed is taken away from him as he returns to the status of a dog.The image of the dog feeling docile and comfortable again in the professor's house at the end feels sad and pathetic: the professor's \\"escape\\" from justice (he has after all ended a man's life - more effectively than giving him a lobotomy like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) seems nothing more than a nasty cheap trick.I read the book to mean that Shariks were perhaps the inevitable result of a revolution over bourgeois manners - and that is was foolish to be an optimistic liberal and think that man in his natural state would be any different. Both the communists and the professor (liberals) sought to transform man into some new image - in this novel both I think are proved deluded - not just the communists who it is fashionable to slate, but also the progressives and liberals, who favoured a more gradual and mild mannered reform.And for those smug Westerners who have been writing about the lumpen proletariat, can I just add that I have lived in both Europe/UK and Russia - and I know that Soviet people were by no means the unsophisticated oafs that bigoted liberal democrats would portay them to be. I believe there is more genuine humanity in the Shariks of this world, than the twee, effete and superior wealthy of the West."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"This satirical dystopian novella was written in 1925 in the Soviet Union and was, not surprisingly, banned there until 1987.

This short novel is immensely funny and satirical. Sharik, a mongrel dog, is rescued by a successful Doctor and is taken back to his seven roomed apartment where he is treated for his scalded flank and fed. Sharik's life becomes extremely comfortable until Bulgakov takes the story down a wonderful fantastical path with hilarious consequences and wonderful barbs at the Russian bureacracy. Although written in 1925 it was not published in Russia until 1987 and so sadly many Russians missed the opportunity of savouring its satiral look at early Post Revolution Russia."},{"Title":"Heart of a dog","review":"Bulgakov is one of my favorite authors and I had already read the book in russian a long time ago.

The book starts with a few chapters of general character setup, then about half way through really picks up speed of development, even though much of it is dialogue based (and how inventive and effective it is! There are many very funny parts beyond the half-way point). The bizarreness of the evolving events is justified for the reader by the valuable reflections about individual and social-political processes that are displayed."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"The title says it all. \\"Mr. Britling Sees It Through\\" ... gosh, it's almost a parody of a H.G. Wells title. It's the story of how Mr. Britling makes it through World War One; although I should point out that he never once leaves England nor even, so far as I can remember, his study.Look, I really liked this book, and I wish I could give it a higher rating; and Wells is a good enough writer to ensure that the book has some good things in it (Mr. Britling's \\"affair\\" with a theatrically emotional woman is hilarious); but in all fairness I must say that (a) Not all that much happens - I know Mr. Britling has a son at the front, but the resulting tension isn't enough to build a novel out of, and (b) There's something a touch self-indulgent about Mr. Britling's armchair angst, and so as a result (c) Wells sometimes misses the point of his own fable. But if anyone has any desire at all to read this book, I say, give in to it."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"I'm a huge H.G Wells fan. On this one he steps outside the science fiction genre and gives us a compelling look into the mind of a man as he and his nation are pulled into war. It's actually very similar to the process I've seen the American psyche going through since 9-11, previously opposed to war, then whole-heartedly engaged, then questioning it.I think this book would be a good choice for history buffs, since it does such an excellent job of showing us how things were during World War I and what the mood was like during that time.Wells himself followed a similar course to his character. His leaned philosophically in the direction of pacifism, but when the First World War began he supported it at first, then after a while he gravitated back to his more pacifistic views.This is an excellent book and I really enjoyed reading. Wells was a wonderful writer and very talented at telling a great story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"I got this book as a gift from my brother. I have always loved H.G. Wells' books, and though this one is not in the same genre that I'm used to, I really loved it. It's sad and brilliant and sometimes hilarious. The message is deep and timely. Even though it's about a different war, the sentiment is still the same. What war does to the psyches of individuals and nations does not change. It unites us for a time only to eventually leave us feeling dirty. H.G. Wells shows us this process works in this excellent book. I really enjoyed reading it, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"I've always appreciated these Klutz books and find this one good at addressing my timing problems. I haven't gotten too far into the book yet - my progress is slow - but I feel it has well lived up to its reputation and my expectations so far."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"This is a surprisingly powerful novel, but not one with aliens or fantastic machines or representations of utopian futures, which are the things for which H.G. Wells is most noted. This is not that kind of book. There isn't a driving plot that requires resolution. It falls firmly into the \`literary' genre, exploring how people react to events that threaten to change their view of the world. The event, of course, is World War I, and the story is a personal and very human account of the war's first years, not from one of the combatants, but from a father who provides a broader yet still intimate perspective. When it was published in 1916, it would be considered contemporary fiction. Now, it might be seen as historical fiction.The first quarter of the book sets a scene of tranquil Essex in 1914, relatively untainted by the hustle and bustle of nearby London or by the changes going on throughout the rest of the world. The main character, Mr. Britling, is a fairly well known writer of essays and articles. He is an optimist. He believes in reason and in humanity's ability to exercise good judgment. His worldview is about to be challenged. (I got the distinct impression that much of Mr. Britling was an autobiographical representation of Mr. Wells.)As fiction, this book humanizes the experience of WWI in a way that history cannot. It shows the initial disbelief, denial, outrage, grief, and attempts at rationalization that Mr. Britling experiences. It comments on politics, ideology, religion, and the stupidity and waste of war from the perspective of a person detached enough to observe it rationally while involved enough to experience it emotionally. It's a powerful combination. It stimulates the readers' minds as well as their feelings.I won't summarize the story. Others have done that. If you wish, you can view the Wikipedia entry. One overriding theme of the book is how the characters perform mental gymnastics to adjust the reality of the war with their understanding of the world. Mr. Britling observes that the war is incompatible with the idea of God promoted by the Church, so he imagines a different one, which still allows him to retain his optimism about humanity. In this way, he carries on. He sees it through.I can't honestly recommend this book for everyone, but I would suggest it to fans of H.G. Wells and those with an interest in WWI. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"This novel was published in 1916, right in the middle of WWI, when that conflict seemed interminable. Thus, its appearance was timely, and it still serves as an authentic portrait of how the war on the home front affects a middle-class, well-educated family and its father, a writer who, while basically patriotic, feels himself to be tolerant, pacific, and reasonable. The Britling family even employs a German tutor, Heinrich, for their son. Yet Heinrich must leave as war gathers; he does so damning conflict and nationalists. This is where the book serves as history: while many did not think Germany would actually go to war, it was likewise expected. Germany's rising military power would eventually collide with others. Mr. Britling blames Germany nonetheless for lack of self-control, of disrupting the balance, of not playing the game. Perhaps forgotten is the fact that Germany's invasion of Belgium pushed some Flemish to flee to England as refugees. The Britlings even put a family up, with believable though containable culture shock. There are Zeppelin raids, food rationing, everyone doing their bit and, finally, the news that Hugh, the Britling son, has been killed on the Western Front. It is in how Mr. Britling tries to come to terms with this that the book strenghtens, as he(Mr. Britling is inclined to pontificate)declaims his belief in a fallible, flexible God who is in everyone, everywhere, giving meaning to life and death -- an unusual turn for Wells, a lifelong atheist. The book's conclusion sees Mr. Britling writing to the family of Heinrich, killed in Russia, responding to their request for him to send them their son's fiddle, left in England. This letter, and the emotions and thoughts he expresses in it, helps him find a kind of peace. Mr. Britling has thus seen it through."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"\\"Mr. Britling Sees It Through\\" was written while World War I was still raging. For the first 200 pages of this 450-page work, I was won over by some of the most muscular prose I had ever read. It was beautifully-written, lucid, poetic. After that 200-page mark, though, it sinks into vicious anti-German WWI-era propaganda. \\"Kill the Kaiser,\\" \\"the Dirty Huns,\\" etc.History courses around the world study what we now know to be Allied lies about Germany to get America into the war. For instance, we NOW know that the Germans weren't \\"crucifying Belgians,\\" nor bayonetting babies for practice, nor \\"making soap out of human corpses\\". So successful was this line of propaganda that many of its best gems were recycled for the second World War a generation later [and still survive as urban legends today, among the uneducated]. But the truth is: We now know exactly what British authors and operatives came up with the propaganda, what authorities authorized it and who aided in its dissemination.Furthermore, we now know [what they didn't at the time] that H.G. Wells was hired to be on the staff of the very first official board of the British Ministry of Propaganda. He was a hireling of the government to spread what he knew were lies in order to persuade peace-loving men to murder in the name of their leaders' agendas.For that Wells can never be forgiven.If he was an artist before 1916 [and \\"Mr. Britling Sees It Through\\"], he was the worst sort of political hack and moral reprobate afterward--filling his novels with intentional lies and phony atrocities in order to stir murderous, irrational blood-lust to advance British Imperialist goals."},{"Title":"Some Price to Pay","review":"Some Price To Pay is an excellent read!

Sometimes his descriptions are vaguer than in other parts but he gives enough description for the reader to not have to wonder what the heck is going on. His detail when describing places, like the football (soccer) stadium is excellent and one can almost feel as if they are there watching the exciting game and can just see the excited and disappointed fans.

The terrorist group is run by the boy's father and the attack was a diversion though. MI6 sends Alex into space to a space station to try to stop the real attack.

The end was completely UNREALISTIC, what 14 year old goes into space? Astronauts train for years to go into space and then they decide that an untrained 14 year old boy should go into a space capsule and fly into space. Of course, this drastic decision happens in maybe 1 hour or 30 minutes. Overall, the beginning captured my attention and it was quite interesting. However I think I'll read the previous Alex Rider books to see if they are better than 'Ark Angel'."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"Not even a sniper's bullet can stop Alex rider.

The books in order from first to last are Stormbreaker, Point Blank, Skeleton Key, Scorpia, and Ark Angel. This book is an action and thriller that would be for teens or even adults that enjoy action, adventure and suspense. I enjoyed this book because of how it made me want to read until the last page. Alex also made me worried because of how he would go to find something or get something no matter what the conditions were. The theme of this book would be never give up or accept defeat. Do you think Alex has what it takes to prove himself that he can save thousands of people?"},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"Ark Angel is one of the best books that Anthony Horowitz has ever made. It makes sense but it gets hard to follow when you find out Mr. Drevin is the bad guy. Compared to Scorpia I think it seems better because Scorpia lacked the plot and Alex wasn't in action. This book has action and adventure and it seemed that Alex wouldn't survive. I hope Anthony Horowits makes another one very soon because he is a great author and one of my favorites.

Ark Angel is the sequel to Scorpia, the book where he was mixed up with the terrorist group.Alex Rider is a reluctant teenage spy. He thinks that he is like a lifeless puppet and MI6 is putting his life on the line. His uncle had been training him ever since he was six, carefully enough that Alex did not even know it. He thought he had been doing SCUBA diving, karate, surfing, and many other things all for fun. In the first book, Stormbreaker, Alex's uncle was killed and Alex was mixed up with MI6. He has already saved the world five times. Now, he is working for his CIA on his next mission after his unpleasant sniper recuperation.He must spy on Nikolia Drevin, the fourth or fifth richest man in the world.

While there, he must overcome more dangers, deceptions, and only to face his worst adventure yet...Ark Angel is an adventure and action book. I would rate it an obvious 10 out of 10.

The full force of a twenty-pound oxygen cylinder hit him right between the legs. His face went mauve and he dropped the knife... He crumpled, eyes bulging.\\" Usually M16 and the CIA don't chose 14 year old to be a spy, but Alex is an exception. Alex almost is killed on every mission he goes on. Alex Rider has been in some bad situations, but nothing tops what is in this book. First, he was sent to the hospital because of a nearly fatal sniper bullet. Then he was \\"accidentally\\" kidnapped. He was almost killed in a burning building. Then he tries to get two weeks of R & R. but he has to try to spend it with one of the richest people in the world. Nikolie Drevin (the rich man) challenges Alex to a go-kart race. Sounds easy? Try racing against someone who will do whatever it takes to win (even killing), oh and did I mention their going over 80 MPH! The karts are open wheeled and have no roll cage. The last person to race Nikolie had a broken arm, broken ribs, and a fractured skull. Drevin finds out Alex works for M16 and the CIA. Drevin tried to kill him by locking him in a sunken ship when Alex went scuba diving. Alex gets back to the beach and hides. He tries to see if Drevin is going to run but is captured. He gets away then kite surfs about eight miles before the CIA rescues him. A rocket caring a bomb is taken to Ark Angel and Alex either has to defuse it of move it (the bomb that is). Alex succeeds and lands in the waters off Australia. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Alex Rider series or likes realistic fiction books.I like this book because it isn't too far from what can happen today. Like when Alex is trapped in the sunken WW2 ship. And when he's trapped in the burning building.I also like how he was able to get away (for a little bit) from the people that try to kidnap him. He got rid of \\"Silver Tooth\\" by using a defibrillator on his neck. He got rid of \\"Spectacles\\" with an air tank in between the legs. \\"Combat Jacket\\" was hit in the chest with a ten-pound medicine. And \\"Metal Watch\\" was \\"sucked\\" into a MRI machine.When Alex went to space was cool and funny. Whenever he tried to push of a wall gently, he would launch himself. Then he saw Kasper (not the ghost!). He had a knife and tried to kill Alex. Alex wins (of course) and moves the bomb. Then he lands in the water on earth.A.

If you like adventure and suspense, you will love this thrilling book. Alex Rider is 14 years old and works for M16 in England. He has saved the world several times and has barely escaped death in each of his missions. In this book he starts out in a hospital and ends up trying to save the world. He battles a terrorist group called force three. Alex puts all the clues and figures out the reality of force three. This superior spy even makes a trip into space to stop a deadly disaster.

Even if you don't read the first books you can still get right to the action in Ark angel. The best part in Ark angel is that never once did I ever want to stop reading. Every chapter is full of action. One of the best part of Anthony Horowitz writings is that you can almost be in Alex Riders shoes and see everything he sees and does. The one thing I really want to say about this book is I really want to know what happens next!"},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"i would say that ARK ANGEL is one of the better, but not the best alex rider books. Horowitz i believe is running out of ideas and he is therefore slowing down somewhat. this book is somewhat slow to begin, but picks up later on. i found it to be very similair to like a james bond movie. \\"moonraker\\" to be exact. this book was more traditonal than the last title \\"scorpia\\" wich i actually found to be my favorite in the series and coincidentally the longest as well. as i am getting older, i am starting to find these books kinda \\"cheesy\\". i guess i am losing intrest in the whole child secret agent thing. if you really want some instant action though, these are the books for you. i kinda like to have somewhat of a subplot though. this book doesnt really have one. it is very straight forward and that is what makes these alex rider books great for young readers or people who simply need a fun book often finding that you \\"have\\" to read somthing.now, what had set this book apart from the others? well, nothing. thats why i didnt give it five stars. anthony horowitz is really desperate to grab the readers attention so he uses \\"explosive\\" action. in saying this, i mean like guns and killing and death. sure it is good for like two books, but after there have been five or so, it gets old. fortunatly, horowitz can still recover, but we'll just have to see in whatever he writes next."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"What would you do if your friend was in danger? Would you let him be harmed, or would you help him out. Alex Rider, the main character in this fiction book was not going to let his new friend be harmed. By doing this, he runs into a huge amount of trouble along the way.Alex Rider, a four-teen year old boy that is a M16 agent, or spy, lives a lonely life. He does not have a mom or a dad, and his uncle was killed while working for M16. He is a very brave character that does not know when enough is enough. Because of this, he never gets to just relax. He always is in trouble some how.The bullet is supposed to kill Alex, but amazingly, he lives. He is in a fantastic hospital, watching TV with stitches in his chest when it all starts. Three tough guys come looking for Alex's friend in the hospital. His name is Paul Drevin, a spoiled kid that is the son of a multimillionaire. There is one thing in their way, Alex Rider. Thinking Alex is Paul, they take Alex. After finding out Alex is not Paul, they try to kill him many ways. Obviously, none of them work.After Paul's dad, Nickolei Drevin finds out about this, he does not know how to thank Alex. Imagine being offered to go to a huge, huge house with everything you could dream of. This is the offer that Alex could not turn down. Alex becomes better friends with Paul, but then Paul's dad finds out about M16 and the CIA. The missiles that Drevin is setting off are supposed to help Ark Angel, (in space) but it is going to destroy it. Alex Rider is the only way. Do you think he makes it?It was almost impossible for me to put this book down. There is so much action that I felt like I was there. Ark Angel is a very interesting book and it is filled with suspense and action. I recommend it to anybody. If they have been waiting for a book to pull them into the story, here is their chance. They will not believe everything that Alex Rider does."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"Wonder what it's like to go on vacation with a friend and next thing you know you have to turn the vacation into a spy mission?

While on vacation Alex finds out that Mr. Driven is a major criminal. Then the CIA asks Alex to go up into outer space to move a bomb that is in Mr. Driven's space hotel so it does not explode sending chunks of debris towards Washington D.C.

Before reading this book you should read the book StormBreaker, then Point Blank, then Skeleton Key, then Eagle Strike, and then the book Scorpia to get a better understanding of the characters in the book.

The plot is a little lack luster and I feel as though Horowitz wrote this one without much thought, although it does throw in a surprise twist that you have to read almost 300 pages to discover. Overall I expected a better effort by Horowitz but still a decent book. Not one of his best novels, but still interesting enough.Grade: B-"},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"\\"Ark Angel\\" is my first go at an Alex Rider novel. Even without reading the five preceding books, I enjoyed this one for what it is: a spy novel for young adults. Horowitz jumps right into the new story and explains previous plot lines enough for the reader to keep up. There is virtually no character development or exploration; there are constant plot twists and turns. Whether this is a positive or negative probably depends upon the reader. If the reader is looking for a character to identify with, to journey with, to aspire to, Alex is a bit thin. If the reader wants rollicking excitement without bogging down, this could be a good vein to mine.\\"Ark Angel\\" reminds me of the theatrical \\"Mission: Impossible\\" films: action driven, violent, uncomplicated. \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" or \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" it isn't.While Horowitz isn't among the top tier of Young Adult Fiction writers (J.K. Rowling, Robert Cormier, Lloyd Alexander, Gary Paulsen, Laurie A. Williams come to mind, but there are many more) but he's a competent craftsman who has extended Ian Fleming's 007 to a younger, contemporary audience. I imagine that fans of Horowitz might eventually graduate to richer material."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"this is one of Anthoney Horrowitz best book Ark Angel was an incredibly writtin book. it was incredible it always kept me thinking on what was going on. this book will keep you on edge its always making you think if he is ever going to survive and if he can be the hero."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"Alex lives! After his run in with terrorists at the end of \\"Scorpia\\" Alex is in the hospital after being shot. But when a group of dangerous eco-terrorists break in, Alex is up to his old tricks, miraculously dodging bullets and defeating madmen. Alex is then invited to go on vacation with a boy he meets in the hospital, Paul Drevin. Turns out his father is millionaire Nikolei Drevin, who is creating a space hotel called Arc Angel. But Alex senses something is not right with Drecin and Ark Angel, and as always, Alex is on to something. The action is heart-stopping, and that makes this book very fun to read. The crazed millionaire premise has been used before (\\"Eagle Strike\\") but the book is too darn entertaining for that to matter. There are some preposturous action scenes (notably Alex's launch into space and his escape from the burning tower block) but that adds to the sheer guilty pleasure of reading this book.

I, as an adult, enjoyed the book; however, I do not believe that it is appropriate reading for those under 15 years. Within the first paragraph it talks about a man being killed, the words Kill/Killing are used four times within the first chapter, not to mention a detailed description of a death scene. In chapter 4, poor Alex is being tortured and the torturers are threatening to cut off his finger. This seems a bit violent for younger readers. It is action filled with lots of violence and blood, definitely a fast and enjoyable read for those who like such books. BEWARE parents as this series is being advertised to 4th grade and lower children."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"BANG!

In some parts it may seem boring or confusing, but whatever you do don't stop reading.

When I first got this book, I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, I was up I until about two in the morning. It starts when Alex meets the millionaire's son and then it progresses from there. I encourage anyone who likes anything to read this book. It is non-stop action,and I hope that Anthony Horowitz writes another book in this series."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"'Scorpia' is a hard act to follow, being the best and most emotionally draining Alex Rider adventure yet, and while 'Ark Angel' reached no where near the caliber of intensity that can be found in 'Scorpia', it is still as fun as ever.Yes people, he's back (you all thought he would be an angel ... shame), and Alex is madder than ever. After being shot by the unforgiving criminal orginization Scorpia, 'Ark Angel' picks up in a hospital where Alex is recuperating and ready once and for all to give up spywork and the heartless MI6. However, when Alex befriends the son of Russian millionaire Nikolei Drevin, Paul, in the hospital, everything changes as Alex is pulled along into another action-packed adventure after he saves Drevin's son from a high-stakes kidnapping plot. What follows are the always interesting tropical islands, rockets in space, and of course maniacal bad guys and trained killers.As usual, this new adventure is full of Horowitz's trademark action sequences, humor, and unexpected plot turns that will keep the reader glued to their seats. Alex is still seething at MI6, but he is no where near as mad as he was in 'Scorpia'. As a character, Alex didn't do much growing, but how can he since he grew leaps and bounds in the last book? So no minus points there, but, the only problem this adventure suffers is the sometimes repetive action sequences. I know it's hard to recreate gun-shot escapes, but how many times can a bullet pass over your shoulder without taking a bit off? The essential political backdrop is there once again, and Horowitz makes it simple enough for any reader to understand. Some favorite characters make reappearences, while others don't. Mrs. Jones does not make an appearence and I hope that after her intense encounter with Alex in 'Scorpia', Horowitz has more planned for her character. While not the best in the series, readers will still love to plunge back into Alex's bond-like world and experience the reality and just plain coolness of being a teenage spy. I highly reccommend this adventure to all fans of the series and regular readers who want to know what it would really be like to be a teenage spy (no offense Carmen and Junie)."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"Before you read the review of ARK ANGEL, you need to take into account that this is the sixth book in the engaging, entertaining, action-packed adventure series starring Alex Rider. If you haven't read the first five books in the series, you'll probably want to do that before you pick up ARK ANGEL. Although it can stand on its own, you'll feel more in the loop by reading the previous books first.ARK ANGEL picks up immediately whereScorpia (Alex Rider Adventure), book five, left off. At the end of that book, we saw Alex Rider on the ground, wounded by a sniper's bullet. For those who thought that Anthony Horowitz was planning to kill off our favorite young MI6 agent, please be assured that ARK ANGEL does not in any way imply dead. Alex is alive and relatively well, recuperating in an exclusive private hospital in London. The sniper's bullet missed his heart, instead bouncing off a rib and exiting out his arm. Now, as he's recovering in posh room nine of the hospital, he becomes friends with Paul. The same Paul that turns out to be the son of Nikolai Drevin, one of the richest men in the world.When Alex saves Paul during a kidnapping attempt, Nikolai invites Alex to finish his recuperation at his estate. Alex soon wonders at the wisdom of being in Drevin's company, however, when he learns that an eco-terrorist group known as Force Three has threatened not only the Drevin family, but the safety of the entire world.Nikolai Drevin's latest project, Ark Angel, is in full swing. Designed to become the first ultimate luxury hotel in outer space, it contains everything the world's richest people could want. It's also, at least according to Force Three, a threat to the environment of Earth as we know it. Now the members of the terrorist group are out to stop Ark Angel from ever opening, and they'll do anything--and everything--they can to see their mission come to completion. Even if it means hurtling the hotel back through the atmosphere and onto Earth's surface.ARK ANGEL is another action-adventure read that will keep you turning pages right through to the end. Alex Rider has come a long way since the fourteen-year old boy roped into complying with MI6, but there's part of him that's still determined to leave the spy organization for good. Yet he knows that his skills are needed, and the unending action of ARK ANGEL show in detail why that is. You won't go wrong with any of the books in the Alex Rider series, and I can say that I'm excited about the opening of the movieAlex Rider - Operation Stormbreaker (Widescreen Edition), the first Alex Rider adventure, which is in development now."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"In the sixth Alex Rider Adventure, Alex is recovering from his encounter with a sniper who had been sent to kill him. In the hospital, he meets Paul Drevin, son of multibillionaire Nikolei Drevin. While in the hospital, kidnappers come for Paul. The kidnappers are part of Force Three, a group of eco-terrorists who are angry that Nikolei Drevin caused the extinction of several species of birds during rocket launches for his latest project, Ark Angel, a space hotel. However, Alex defends Paul against Force Three and prevents them from kidnapping him. Rewarding Alex for protecting his son, Nikolei Drevin invites Alex to spend some time with Paul and him in their extraordinary homes, leading up to the launch of one of the most important pieces of the space hotel. Alex finds that Force Three, Ark Angel, and Nikolei Drevin are not what they seem to be and despite Alex's refusal to once again become involved in the world of deception, and spying, he finds himself working to defeat \\"the biggest criminal in the world.\\"I generally find that books in the Alex Rider series tend to get a touch too repetitive. However, in ARK ANGEL, although it did have some parallels to other books in the series, Anthony Horowitz successfully threw twists into the plot that set the book apart from its predecessors. I also congratulate Mr. Horowitz on the great amount of research he did on topics covered in the book. He even threw in some physics, explaining rotational inertia and some nice examples of Newton's Laws! The setting for the end of the book was very unique and gave the book an exciting ending, but I wish that Anthony Horowitz did not put Alex Rider in so many life or death situations. I enjoy the creative ways Alex Rider slips away from his enemies, but it starts to get a little old when I find that for the third time in the book Alex has dodged a bullet that passes centimeters over his shoulder. ARK ANGEL as a whole has more positives than negatives and definitely is an enjoyable book that Alex Rider fans will love as a great addition to the series.Reviewed by Seth Cassel for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations."},{"Title":"Ark Angel (An Alex Rider Adventure)","review":"Oh the places you will go, Alex Rider!Ark Angel is the latest chapter in the saga of Alex Rider.

While on vacation Alex finds out that Mr. Driven is a major criminal. Then the CIA asks Alex to go up into outer space to move a bomb that is in Mr. Driven's space hotel so it does not explode sending chunks of debris towards Washington D.C. This book was very fun to read because there was never a dull moment where I said to myself that I wanted to put the book down. Right when something exciting ended something else exciting happens. Before reading this book you should read the book StormBreaker, then Point Blank, then Skeleton Key, then Eagle Strike, and then the book Scorpia to get a better understanding of the characters in the book.

Say again? Spy? Fourteen?To be sure, Alex is not a willing spy. No sir! At the end ofScorpia (Alex Rider Adventure), Alex is shot by an assassin's bullet and left for dead. No discerning reader for the first second thought Alex dead--there are two more books in the series--but what an ending!! Now Alex is madder than heck and not about to take any more! He never wanted to be a spy and certainly vows vociferously never again!Until. In the hospital where Alex is recovering, there is another teen in the room next to Alex. This teen is son of a billionaire, who is being targeted by eco-terrorists. You see, Nikolai Drevin is building Ark Angel, a hotel in space for the super rich. What better way to punish Drevin than by kidnapping his son and making him pay! Alex thwarts the plan and defeats three experienced killers--believe it or not.Plausibility is Horowitz's secret ingredient in the success of the Alex Rider series. He makes the most outrageous escapades and actions believable!In addition to wild action, Horowitz again introduces a nefarious villain, who is seemingly a crusader for good. What makes Alex so effective as a spy is simple. For various reasons, Alex can get into the inner sanctoriums of these villains, then use his special talents. Just as some people are talented in art, sports, science, writing, Alex is a great responder in emergency situations. His brain goes into overdrive.In \\"Ark Angel\\" Horowitz outdoes himself in the final episode. I won't write a spoiler here, but I will say that Horowitz makes the reader feel exactly what Alex experiences. It is quite unbelievably plausible.I love this series!

A near fatal bullet wound won't stop him either, as Ark Angel has as much action as the previous books if not more.The book begins with Alex in the hospital recovering from the Sniper's attack from last book. The hospital quickly becomes a battle zone when four armed men come in during the night to kidnap a kid. The kid is no normal kid either, as he is the son of Nicolei Drevin one of the richest men on the planet. Being Alex, he rushes in to save him. Before you know it the book starts an incredibly long road trip. This includes London, Washington D.C., a Caribbean island named Flamingo Bay, and finally to the book's most unbelievable final location.The book sometimes teeters on the edge of believable and non-believable, however I feel Anthony Horowitz did a good very good job at making a mostly believable yet exciting adventure. It also feels like Anthony did a lot of research on this book even without the series' first acknowledgement section.The book also does a good job at explaining why Alex is being locked up instead of just shooting him on one of the many times Alex gets caught. However, there a couple instances near the end that would have been so much easier for the bad guy to bring a gun other than going through all the trouble that they did.If you like a book nearly bursting at its seams with action and danger, than this book is definitely for you.

I love them, they are action packed have you at the edge of your seat and I can say that it doesn't bother me that my ten year old son keeps reading them over and over. It is fun to read the same things that your kids love and love it so much your self. I am addicted to this series. This book was great on it's own, you don't need the whole series for back ground. But reading them all is so much fun."},{"Title":"Telling the Success Story: Acclaiming and Disclaiming Discourse (S U N Y Series in Speech Communication)","review":"* I believe that this book is best suited for academic readers, thus, my review is aimed at that audience*I found this book to be very useful in several respects, particularly as it contributed to the literature on entitlements and enhancements and incorporated the use of what the author refers to as 'disclaiming' strategies (dissociations; detractions) to downplay one's success(es). Very well done.That said, as one who does research in this area, I noticed a few things that I felt detracted from the overall quality and appropriateness of the work.1. I would have preferred to see a more precise and telling use of terminology for some of the new(ish) concepts introduced... 'disclaiming', after all, is not a new term whatsoever in the broader impression management literature. In fact, the term is widely used to refer to strategies that seek to distance oneself (or others) from negative phenomena. Likewise, the term 'dissociation' is far too broad/general to refer to diminishing one's responsibility for otherwise positive phenomena.2. The concept of ingratiation (Jones, 1964; Jones & Pittman, 1982)- seeking the perception or attribution of likability - is never mentioned explicitly, although its component facets (e.g., rendering favors; opinion conformity) are discussed. To discuss the facets of ingratiation without ever recognizing the parent concept from which they flow is strange to me, especially when the parent concept is so widely recognized and seminal to this area of work.3. The concept of self-promotion (Jones & Pittman, 1982) - seeking the attribution of competence - is never explicitly mentioned, either. This too is very odd to me, in that the key thrust/idea of the book (in my opinion) is in dealing with what Jones and Pittman (1982) referred to as the 'self-promoter's paradox' -&#62; i.e., seeking the perception of competence in the eyes of others while avoiding the appearance of immodesty/self-aggrandizement. (I must add here that I view entitlement and enhancement as components of self-promotion).Despite these quibbles, all in all, I found this to be a very worthwhile read and solid contribution to the image/impression management literature."},{"Title":"Telling the Success Story: Acclaiming and Disclaiming Discourse (S U N Y Series in Speech Communication)","review":"This book by Pam Benoit is a wonderful description of how people respond to success. This is a book that anyone who has experienced personal or professional successes will appreciate. Benoit describes the delicate process of balancing complimenting, bragging, modesty, and self-enhancement. Useful for individuals, businesses, and any other organizations who want to understand how to create a favorable impression when they describe their successes. It includes stories of athletes, Mary Kay consultants, and Nobel Prize Winners all in the context of intricate analyses of interpersonal accomplishments."},{"Title":"Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen: The Fifty-Seventh Massachusetts Veteran Volunteers in the Army of the Potomac, 1864-1865","review":"This is a comprehensive and authoritative regimental history, and really sets the standard for this genre. What I like most about it, since I research Canadians who served in the Civil War, was the detailed regimental roster that the authors compiled. Unfortunately, this book is out of print and may be difficult and/or costly to track down, but should you get your hands on a copy, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen: The Fifty-Seventh Massachusetts Veteran Volunteers in the Army of the Potomac, 1864-1865","review":"This book started out as a geneology project. Warren Wilkinson discovered that his maternal great great grandfather Martin Farrell was a veteran of the 57th. Wilkinson did more digging. He discovered that a history of the 57th had been published by John Anderson, a former captain of the 57th. After several readings, Wilkinson was irked. He ended up discovering that Anderson's history was a highly sanitized version. No doubt Anderson was trying to spare veterans and their families of the less than savory aspects of the war. Freed from such restraint, Wilkinson embarked on a four year journey to find the real history of the 57th. The result was this work and it is a magnificent effort from beginning to end. Having done his research in chronological order, he ended up with over 1500 manuscript pages which also included a complete regimental roster of all who served with the 57th. Many Civil War books are deeply researched, but sometimes their authors lack skill with a pen. Not so with Wilkinson, his account of the 57th's first action in the Wilderness on May 6th is some of the most vivid battle writing you will ever encounter. As if that wasn't enough, his account of the Crater and the 57th's role in that fiasco is even better. In short, Wilkinson makes the war come alive. I was reminded of Bruce Catton's Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece, \\"A Stillness at Appomattox,\\" many times while reading. If anything, this book could be called the regimental version of the same story. With any luck, hopefully a university press will reprint this Civil War classic. Without doubt, this is one of the best regimental histories ever written. Whitman's absurd statement that \\"the real war will never get into the books,\\" is proved wrong by Wilkinson's magnificent book."},{"Title":"Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen: The Fifty-Seventh Massachusetts Veteran Volunteers in the Army of the Potomac, 1864-1865","review":"Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen covers the relatively short but extremely brutal service of the Fifty-Seventh Massachusetts Veteran Volunteers from initial recruitment in the fall of 1863, through Grant's Overland Campaign, and on to the trenches surrounding Petersburg, Virginia. Of the 900+ members who started with the regiment when it left Worcester, Massachusetts, in early spring 1864, only ten men made it through the last year of the war unscathed. The regiment was one of Fox's famous \\"300 fighting regiments\\", having lost 19.1% killed or mortally wounded. Wilkinson disputes this figure, and his calculations raise the total to 20.5% of the total killed or mortally wounded. Regardless of the exact numbers, this regiment suffered appalling casualties in a short amount of time. This story is dramatic enough in the hands of a pedestrian writer. Wilkinson, however, kept me interested sentence by sentence, page by page through 371 total pages of text. Wilkinson describes the experiences of these men, both the good and the bad, in great detail. He doesn't fall prey to idolizing his subject matter. A reader learns that these were men with human failings, but that some were able to rise above these failings to fight resolutely for their cause. The roster located just after the text is amazing as well. Even privates receive quite a lot of attention. The roster runs from page 403 to page 623, and is a valuable reference for genealogists and other researchers. Wilkinson is not finished there, however. His appendices relate even more useful information on the regiment in easily read tables. The first appendix shows regimental strengths and casualties broken down by company for all of the major engagements of the 57th Massachusetts. Wargamers in particular will be interested in this material. If every author of a unit history included this information in as detailed a manner as Wilkinson did, there would be no need for unit strength research in the National Archives. The last two appendices cover statistical summaries of the men in the regiment, and a list of the ten who made it through the war without getting killed or wounded.In conclusion, I am very glad I picked this particular volume to start seriously reading unit histories. To everyone who recommended that I read the book, I thank you. I truly believe this book would appeal to a wide range of readers, even those who are not necessarily Civil War \\"buffs\\". In the same way Glory is an excellent, far-reaching film, Mother, May You Never See The Sights I Have Seen has the ability to reach out to a larger audience. I plan to recommend this book to those that ask me why I'm so interested in the Civil War. It hooks you and doesn't let go, much like a well-written novel. Although I've read only a couple of unit histories, I get the feeling that few I read in the future will be as good as this one. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen: The Fifty-Seventh Massachusetts Veteran Volunteers in the Army of the Potomac, 1864-1865","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago. It is really superb. Very gritty, poignant, detailed. I have a copy in my collection. It is that good."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"Mill is, simply put, remarkably well crafted. In it, David Macaulay gives us a brief history of the beginnings of the textile industry in America, walks us through the planning and construction of four successively more complex mills, lavishly illustrates the buildings, the machines and their power sources and, at the same time, manages to thoroughly convince us that we would never want to work in one.This last trick is subtle and, to my knowledge, doesn't appear in any of the other books in this series. From Cathedral, City and, to a lesser extent, Castle, you get the distinct feeling that these were great and noble projects that you would have loved to have been a part of. You get this sense too from Mill, but the heady rush that comes with the idea of building something from the ground up is tempered by small, fictional diary entries that betray the harshness of life for those who worked in the mills after their completion.Mill is a strong contender for a place in your personal and permanent library. It is beautifully illustrated, historically grounded, thoroughly researched, accented with social commentary and, most importantly, it is an enjoyable, absorbing read."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"This is an important book. Written for children, it can be used just as effectively by adults to comprehend the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the United States. Learn and see how men tamed our rivers and how men, women and children were swallowed up in these great monuments to progress.The illustrations are remakable. David Macaulay deftly describes and illustrates how the technology that made America a world industrial power came to the young new country and how American ingenuity improved it and made the nation into a world class economic juggernaut.The author is a superb story teller, and anyone who would like to visualize the nature of mills and to understand the profound impact of this technology on our country should read it.I highly recommend this great children's book to everyone."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"A wonderful story that takes the reader through the life and times of an infant small village mill into the mature years of a 20th century factory-mill. Excellent illustrations, and fun storyline that allows the reader to become involved with the life of the mill. I loved it."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"Macaulay is an illustrator, architect, engineer, historian, economist, anthropologist and story-teller. He puts all of this knowledge and skill into Mill. It is a totally one-of-a-kind book that does not easily fall under any traditional category. It is often labeled as a \\"kids' book\\" because it has pictures and is relatively short. But very little of the educational content would be considered common knowledge for adults. It reads like a history text-book, a technical manual, and a novel all in one.It is an epic, multi-generational story of a fictional New England town that is born out of the textile boom of the Industrial Revolution. You follow the cotton-milling and cloth-weaving operations of this town and its mills as they grow and expand, incorporate new technology, and endure the tides of fortune. Along the way, you get to learn all the details of the planning, the machinery, the construction, read excerpts from the characters' journals and watch the town slowly grow and change over time. In the end, this short book feels like a monumental journey and it will leave you not only satisfied but smarter too.I've read most of Macaulay's books and this is probably the best."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"There's showing, and then there's telling. David Macaulay has mastered the art of show-and-tell - his books put knowledge and creativity right in your hands, then pull it apart and let you see how it works. Macaulay has a gift.While his picture books are unusual and interesting, his technology books (Castle, Cathedral, How it Works) are unmatched.This book shows four (fictional) textile mills at a single village in Rhode Island, as the technology advanced over the centuries. Everything from the architecture of the buildings to the design of the power systems to how the buildings are lit and heated - it's all in there. Some great (fictional) journal outtakes show the years progressing. History - science - personalities - inventiveness... it's all in this book."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"My 9-year-old son absolutely loves David Macaulay'sCastle,Pyramid,Cathedral: The Story of Its Construction, and now Mill. This book focuses on the textile industry and illustrates and gives the history of progressively more advanced mills, as well as the history of the industry in general.The black and white illustrations are remarkably compelling and very detailed. I'm not a particularly mechanical person, but I find them relatively easy to understand. These along with the mechanical descriptions have proved quite compelling to my son.This book also has a small number of sample diary entries, giving a more personal feel to what life was like working in a textile mill. These entries, along with the main text descriptions, are very engaging.David Macaulay's books are wonderful additions to any family library, but I would especially recommend them for homeschoolers. For independent reading, I'd recommend at least a 5th grade reading level, but those not yet at that point may benefit from the illustrations and some portions of the text."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"I bought this for my son, who has always been intrigued by construction projects, but I have also enjoyed it quite a bit and learned a lot from it. One point I would make is that it is not quite as simple as some of Macaulay's other books, such as Castle and Cathedral. Whereas those books are easy for even a four-year-old to comprehend, Mill has a more involved story-line and will require more explaining from a parent. I would say that ideally it should be for older children for that reason. But, that doesn't change the fact that it's a great book, and of course the illustrations are amazing."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"David Macaulay has produced a great resource for history teachers with his lushly illustrated book MILL. Within the first few pages he draws the reader into the fascinating story of the birth of the industrial revolution in America. The story begins in the present with the discovery of a Roman coin on the dig site of an old textile mill along the bank of a river in central Rhode Island and continues with a step by step explanation of how and why a textile mill is built and run. Adults as well as children will enjoy this book with it's engaging story and detailed illustrations.

Details on choosing a location for the mill, building the mill, and how the machinery to grind the grain worked puts the reader in the position as the millwright himself. This book is written as part history book, part informational, and even part journal, using fictional diary entries to give the reader a sense of the everyday life of a miller. A touch of drama is thrown in as we read of mill-workers who are injured and/or killed while on the job -\\"1864 August 15: Mary McDonnell was drawn into the machinery by the belting today and lost her right arm below the elbow. I fear the heat will not help her recoveryAugust 17: Mary McDonnell died today, the infection having spread too quickly from her injury. I will send her wages on to her mother in Southbridge.\\"This book is supposedly written for children - I first discovered it in an elementary school library - but I find it more suitable for adults. I have found that many history books geared toward the younger set can have information not found in the more adult-oriented books. The Mill by David Macaulay is one of them. The illustrations themselves are very well done, and the details of running a mill is probably the best I have seen thus far.Great reading about the lifeblood of a 19th century community."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"All of these are marvelous.

Macaulay has been around for decades, and some of the titles are really phenomenal (Cathedral and Underground are my two favorites). I purchased this one because I thought it would relate well to our American History studies this year, and tie in the architecture my son loves. At 8, my son reads well (5th - 6th grade levels), but this book is still a little above him in its density and concepts for purely independent reading. It's better if I read some parts aloud, then let him study the drawings and pick some to duplicate. As you might expect, a mill is interesting, but not captivating. I can't wait to read Pyramid with him in World History next year, however!"},{"Title":"Mill","review":"It is said that in the course of one long human lifetime, places like Ohio went from virgin wilderness to among the most industrialized regions on earth, but the \\"blueprint\\" for the Midwest's growth as a center of industry had its roots in the factory mills of New England. In Mill, the masterful David Macaulay uses direct storytelling, combined with his appealing pen and ink sketches, to bring to our comprehension the founding and operation of a nineteenth-century water-powered textile mill. His tale here takes a reader, young or old, through the development of the mill structure, an event reminiscent of a rural barn raising, into the day to day workings of this efficient industrial complex as it would have been at peak operation. More than just a place of labor, the mills of New England and elsewhere soon became the focal points of entire communities. As this book shows, if a local resident did not himself work at the mill, then one of his relatives, customers, or friends most certainly did. Macaulay pulls no punches, and shows that work in a mill was demanding, dangerous, and strenuous. There were long hours, sunup to sunset, every day except Sunday. David Macaulay also elicits true feeling from his readers as the story wraps around to the demise of the grand old mill, in a later age when industrial evolution makes its processes redundant. Mill may lack some of the grandeur of other Macaulay works such as Cathedral, Castle, or Pyramid, but it has a lot to teach almost anyone, and in this author's hands, learning is both spontaneous and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mill","review":"I enjoyed this book. This the third book I've enjoyed by this author. Mill is good but it could have been more in depth. I realize that it was the author's intent to show only two northeastern mills but it would have been helpful to have seen examples of other mills. Of particular interest to me are mills that used tub wheels. There were no mention of these in the book. The book did fill a need for me as I was researching a particular mill. Based on the book I was able to determine what kind of wheel arrangement was used in the mill being researched. I felt that the drawings in \\"Cathedral\\" were better.

Very good first effort, I await more."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"My 14-year-old daughter just read this book at the recommendation of her teacher. I am confused as to why the teacher's recommendation. The girl in this book made every bad choice there is, every day it seems - all kinds of drugs, alcohol, random sex - with very few consequences. She did coke daily for weeks, had a bad night, and then just stopped doing it. Who knew it was that easy. She drank heavily every night but still made her curfew and got up and went to school - without homework, studying, or failing. She had sex with every one she met, but never got beat up, pregnant, or an STD.The School Library Journal states, \\"Erlbaum doesn't try to excuse her behavior; rather, she analyzes why she went down that self-destructive path and what made her change her ways. Readers will find solace in the knowledge that, despite the lack of structure in her home life, she managed to pull it all together. She worked at an after-school job, starred in a school play, graduated high school, and got into college.But, she didn't change her ways, she didn't pull it all together during the time frame of the book. Her mother paid for college, her grandmother's money paid for an apartment, she quit her after-school job because she was stealing money from the cash register and knew she had been found out; she starred in one play as a freshman or sophomore, but not again because - as she states- it took too much time away from alcohol and drugs; she graduated from high school, but it must have been a school with very few requirements to pass. And the story ends who her moving into her apartment and looking forward to an afternoon joint.One would assume she pulled her life together after high school since she wrote this book, but most girls living this life would have seen different results. And I can't see how Erlbaum today can't have lasting health issues from this lifestyle.The book is a nasty read, and certainly not intended for an eighth grader."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"While Erlbaum is sometimes a decent writer in this blog-like, breathless tome, it's something you've seen many, many times before in the last 20 years. It's not a new idea: sad people go the wrong way in a kind of Dante-like descent into hell as kids and then wake up to become fairly productive adults. Everyone's glad Erlbaum survived, but I have to agree with the review in the Baltimore Sun that says the book runs out of steam quickly. I'd suggest Cupcake Brown's \\"A Piece of Cake\\" for more insight...and more drama, too."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Memoirs can be enticing and addictive. In a bookstore, I always give new ones the once-over in the hope of finding a good story. I've read many enjoyable memoirs, including \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius;\\" \\"Running with Scissors\\" and \\"Dry;\\" \\"A Child Called It,\\" \\"The Lost Boy,\\" and \\"A Man Called Dave;\\" and even \`A Million Little Pieces,\\" which, though riddled with falsehood and deceit, still managed to be well written and thought-provoking.I picked up \\"Girlbomb\\" thinking that perhaps I had found a book of similar caliber. Regrettably, I felt that the book fell well short of not only my high expectations, but also of what could even be considered a mediocre read. Erlbaum failed to endear herself to me, not just once, but repeatedly. A large portion of her problems seemed to stem directly from her own behavior. The promiscuity, the drug-habit, the partying, all did a great deal to further complicate her already bad situation. But she either did not realize this, or did and refused to accept her share of blame. Her trial and tribulations came across as shallow and petty: the violence was less like violence and more like quarreling; the racism was less like racism and more like squabbling; the abuse was less like abuse and more like neglect.That's not to say that she did not face difficulty and hardship, but even these parts seemed shallow and transparent. Sadly, there is little here to compel feelings of concern or even interest. Erlbaum herself seems to be indifferent, failing to communicate anything redeeming from her years spent in misery. The book comes across as resentful, bitter, and self-pitying. Erlbaum does not appear wiser because of her experience; she does not appear to have gained anything from her ordeal. The book lacks sincerity and earnestness, and winds up being tiresome, tedious, and ultimately forgettable."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"The book, Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir, tells the story of 15-year-old Jan, whose serially marrying mom has latched onto a real jerk of a man. She finally tells her mom to make the choice: Him or me. And when the mother chooses the guy, Jan goes from heating soup to grabbing her backpack and walking out the door.She manages to find a shelter, where she stays for several weeks. This is not a sugar-coated story. This is a story of other residents threatening her with knives. Racial tensions. The very young girl who slips away and later is spied at a Port Authority men's room, clearly prostituting herself. Jan bonds with some girls who disappear from her life. It's not a great place to be.Her next step is a group home, which is slightly better. Except by now, Jan has discovered night clubs and cocaine and cigarettes and booze.One element to the story that strikes me as so interesting, having never been a homeless teenager on the streets of New York, is how Erlbaum kept her act together. With very little structure in her home, when she had a home, and then living in a shelter, Erlbaum managed to go to high school. She maintained school friends. She was in the school play. She got into college. She eventually had a somewhat longterm and loving relationship with a guy.But the lifestyle extracted a toll. She had sex with boys she didn't like, much less love. She had drug problems. Her friends were unsupportive. She lied, and she stole.At times, the book feels like a cautionary tale, a relatively modern-day and truthful Go Ask Alice.Other times, the book feels like an exploration of dumb luck. You steal from work, but skip going the day they make arrests? You leave home, become \\"halfway homeless,\\" but manage to score a leading role in the school play and get into college? You leave your friends, and by minutes you miss the guy having the mishap that leaves him in a coma?Sometimes the book seems to rise above the specific matter of Erlbaum, New York City and homeless youths. I personally felt the book echo in my soul. The issues of sexuality, of confusion, of friendships, parent-child relationships, of high school reputations and repercussions could have been my issues in the suburban Midwest in the same era.I kept having this sense of deep memories being shaken loose. I used to get fed up, wanted to run away, get out, go to New York and try things on my own. In Girlbomb, I see what I would have been up against.I didn't know whether I would have been friends with young Janice, or been terribly afraid of her.She wasn't always the sweetest and nicest girl, the true-blue friend or the ideal daughter. It's an honest book, one that neither apologizes nor brags about the facts.Let's not forget this: When we read a book where the subject is so compelling, it's very easy to overlook the writing. When we talk about this book, we tend to discuss the story, the social implications, the woman who is now Janice Erlbaum.We rarely talk about the actual prose. And to me, this is a sign that the writing is perfection. The writing doesn't stand in the way of Erlbaum's story, doesn't lend a false air or a sense of melodrama. It's vivid, concise, humorous, conversational. It's not showy or overwrought.This is a book I highly recommend. If you have teen-age daughters, you might read it and consider whether they ought to read it, too.I'm not just saying this because she's my friend. This is truly one of the best memoirs I've ever read."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Articulate, witty, and unassuming, Janice Erlbaum has presented her audience with a masterwork. She guides us through the roughest times of any young woman's life - namely, high school.Of course, a memoir focusing only on the difficulties of, say, cheating one's way through Chemistry while starring in the Drama Club's Spring production, wouldn't capture us in the way that her \\"halfway homeless\\" memoir does. We're invited to tag along as young Janice finds herself alone in Manhattan after following through on an ultimatum given her mother. From a Catholic teen runaway shelter, to an Upper West Side group home, to a Lower East Side studio, Erlbaum illustrates the confusion, the adaptation, the pain and the humor through which she must wade in order to find the girl in the mirror who keeps reminding her that she is still fragile, somewhere behind all the bravery.\\"Girlbomb\\" is a powerful read that will touch teens, mothers, those who've overcome their own personal struggles, and the rest of us, who just like to peer at the trauma and humor that forever mark the lives of the fiercely independent. With this, her first book, Erlbaum has triumphed as neatly in the publishing world as she did years ago in the New York City of the mid-eighties. And best of all, this memoir is verifiably true!"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"In her memoir, author Janice Erlbaum take the reader inside her halfway-homeless adolescence on the streets, shelters, squats, and apartments of 1980's New York City. She is candid, unapologetic, and speaks with nary a trace of self-pity. She first ended up in a shelter at age 15 when she carried out her ultimatum to her mom--if mom took back her abusive, manipulative, unemployed, baby-shaking husband, Janice was going to walk out. Janice's childhood to date consisted of a revolving door of boyfriends for mom, losers who would be kicked out and taken back again and again, shifting Janice's role from trusted confidante to sullen, rebellious child at each turn.Janice, now an accomplished professional writer, relates her story from the perspective of a teenager. She worries about wearing the right clothes to night clubs. She is in a constant tug-of-war with her two best friends, and their relationship suffers all the petty jealousies and misunderstandings of young adulthood. She seeks escapes via alcohol and the hot street drugs of the mid eighties. Not surprisingly, she confuses sex and love, constantly looking for a protective male figure to latch on to.One striking moment is Janice's identification with Preppie Murder victim Jennifer Levin. Janice reveals the side of the 1980's club kids that the headlines missed. She could identify with trying to fit into the scene, trying to snag the handsome, older scenester (who happens to be a murderer), and to having a moment of drug-fueled lust under a tree in the middle of the night. Janice's revelations make Jennifer Levin seem both less and angelic than the media would like, and far more human as a young girl driven by an overwhelming desire for acceptance and social status.Janice Erlbaum has gripping subject material, but she is also an excellent storyteller. Don't miss out on learning about a halfway homeless young adulthood from this talented writer."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"There are moments when you want to just cry but then Erlbaum exposes herself in such a genuine manner, adding her inimitable touch of humor, that you find yourself laughing at the most bizarre circumstances. Which is much like life because sometimes you have to laugh or you are gonna cry--or worse. Thankfully Erlbaum didn't go for worse, learned how to laugh at herself, and dared to share her story with the world. It should be required reading for any young woman trying to make sense of herself, her world, and her life. Why? Well she won't find the answers to the life, universe, or anything . . . but she might find it okay to look at herself in the mirror and smile. Thank you, Janice, for sharing yourself."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"When a writer can compel you to read on with seeming ease, when you can recognize something of yourself in each of her characters, when dialogue rings true every time, when the writing is clear and insightful, you know you're dealing with a genuine talent. Every page of this memoir of living on the streets of New York City in the 1980s rings true, and rings powerfully due to the forthrightness of Erlbaum in telling the details of her story, and her directness in expressing it.If I were all thumbs, I'd give it 10 thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Girlbomb is an amazing book, and I highly recommend it. The fact that it is a memoir by Janice Erlbaum is great because it really gives you a hands on perspective of the main character. As a female, I was able to relate to Elrbaum on so many levels. Yes she was going through a great deal, but at the core she was a teenage girl, experiencing life as we all do. Not to downplay anything she went through, because honestly I don't know how I would have been in her situation, but as I said she is easy to relate to. Reading this book, I went through an array of emotions...from anger, to happiness, to vulnerability, to love, to jealousy...you name it, you'll find it in Girlbomb. When I realized the book was coming to a close I was sad because I wanted to read more!!! Again, I gove this a million thumbs up. I was lucky enough to meet Janice Elrbaum and she is as real as her book, she is an amazing author, and I look forward to reading anything else she may come out with. So go and put this in your shopping cart, you won't regret it!!!"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Sociologists, social workers, and teachers (myself included) have often mistaken the foster-care system as being full of Afro-American and Hispanic teens, but few whites (Jews in particular). The reason is that the subject of urban poverty and crime among Jewish, or simply Caucasian families rarely gets literary treatment (with the exception of All Souls by Michael P. McDonald).Girl Bomb opened my eyes not only to the subject of white teens from troubled homes, but also the reasons why kids run away. We tend to think that runaways are just spoiled kids who don't want to listen to their parents, but very often they're trying to escape dysfunctional homes. Janice Erlbaum ran away from home because her mother had an abusive boyfriend and was blinded to the way he was destroying her family. Running away was like saying \\"him or us.\\"It's 1985. Erlbaum's mother is Jewish, and from the description, she seems to be a leftover from the hippy era. Taking that a step further, she comes off as the kind of woman whose parents never set ground rules, and allowed their daughter to become rebellious to the point of self-destruction. As an adult, Mrs. Erlbaum keeps hooking up with extremely bad men, who live with their mothers and treat women like dirt. The woman is stupid, sluttish, and incompetent, and no man wants her for long (except the worst kind).Because this woman refuses to exercise any restraint, her daughter, Janice Erlbaum, suffers the most. Her father doesn't want the burden of raising her; he already has children he doesn't want. So he dumps her and her mom. Next, mom comes across another man gets her pregnant, sponges off her, beats her and her daughter, threatens them, etc. But Janice, now 14 and wary of her mother's bad boyfriends, walks out. But she doesn't just hit the streets. She walks into a shelter for homeless teens and asks to be let in.Unsympathetic to her plight, the social workers disregard Janice as another hopeless case. The other teens, mostly Afro-American, take out all their anger on her. Her mother has dumped her abusive boyfriend, yet he still makes threats to take their child from her. She takes out all her anger on Janice, blaming her for all the unhappiness. Nonetheless, Janice adjusts to life in a foster home, holds a job, snorts coke, moves back in with her selfish mother, moves out, scams her employers, takes ecstasy, lives with her boyfriend, pops pills, and all the while stays in High School and graduates. The fact that Erlbaum didn't wind up pregnant, overdose on drugs, or die from AIDS is remarkable. Some kids may be street smart and independent, but nobody was immune to the drugs-and-AIDS epidemics of the 1980's.Janice Erlbaum's miserable family takes up the first quarter of the book. The bulk is about her life after leaving home. Now I'd like to read a sequel. I'd like to know what happened with the rest of her life, going to college, having her own place, New York City in the 1990's, etc. I wonder how her adult life compares with the adventures (or misadventures) she had as a teenager."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"WOw! what can I say about this book? that has not already been discussed.An honest, down to earth memoir about a girl who looked at her life in a realistic and selfless way. No pity party going on here. The writing style is direct and to the point and there is no gratuitous scenes just to make this book \\"better\\".I don't know if I would have survived this world, but I am so glad that the author did and that she wrote her story.Buy It.!!!"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"...in conjunction with this memoir, and I don't think you can state that enough about Erlbaum's inaugural effort. A product of an unsafe home in Brookyn, Erlbaum boke away from domestic strife as a 15-year-old and ran headlong into the clutches of institutional homelessness. The book 'Girlbomb' begins with her escape, and the author takes us on a New York odyssey of bad sex, drugs, petit larceny, violence... all the 'good stuff' anyone could want from a memoir about street life. Erlbaum's language is crisp, her pacing is swift, and she had a gift for deft characterization. A very high recommendation, especially if you're looking to wash the taste of Frey/Leroy out of your mouth."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I read Girlbomb in one sitting this weekend. It was amazingly familiar in that way that relatable stories can be. For me, every description of every street corner was as close as my own memory and it was, at times, uncomfortably, familiar. Reading Janice Erlbaum's recollections and descriptions called to mind the smells, sounds, and heat of New York in that time; small, cramped, under serviced apartments, Cuban salsa music blasting up from streets below. I spent those same 80s living and working in the neighborhoods of the book, spending all of my lunch hours in Washington Square Park and all of my evenings at CBGBs, the Pyramid, or a little Russian coffee shop that I can not recall the name of just now. Janice Erlbaum captures it all perfectly. And on top of that, on top of the completely mesmerizing stories of her struggling teen self, she highlights the sad, dead end, and sometimes hopeless existence of the teen runaway, even if she hasn't run that far. The fear of homelessness and the wrenching realization that one small girl is totally and completely on her own before she's built the coping skills to navigate the harshness of life is palpable and fear-inducing. The helplessness of teens with nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to and no real, long-lasting systems in place to help them is as much a problem in Erlbaum's book as it continues to be today. If everyone who reads this book, donates a dollar to Covenant House or a similar shelter in their own towns and cities, perhaps we can help eradicate the plight of the exploited teens across the country or, at least, create for them a little comfort in a cruel world."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I absolutely loved this book, there is no need to go into detail why, read it for yourself and you will understand, and then read Have You Found Her, which is equally amazing. Janice Erlbaum is a hero for this generation."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Taken through the teenage life of the author in the 1980's Regan-era it was interesting to read what it was like to live in a homeless shelter during that time - especially since being homeless was just coming into the public eye as a real problem in America.Janice writes a thought-provoking reads-as-a-novel memoir that will leave you wanting more.Donna"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I'm reading more biographies & memoirs than I ever used to - and with each one - I feel more and more odd writing a review. What exactly am I reviewing? The author's life or how s/he sees their life - or simply the writing style? It's not like I can comment on the plot or the characters...they are what they are.Which, of course, does not stop me from reading about people's lives... I think I am at a point in my life where fact is becoming far more interesting (and yes, stranger) than fiction.So then - to a truncated and rather unsure review: I spent most of the book yelling at Erlbaum in my head, because as the mother of a young girl, I didn't want her to make the choices she was making. (This yelling was muffled by the fact that I've read Erlbaum's follow up book, \\"Have You Found Her?\\" and know what comes next for the author.)Then again, I certainly can't blame her for her choices...she was in a terrible situation at home, and given the fighting and violence that surrounded her, who's to say running away wasn't the best thing she could have done.There are parts, too, where I wanted to be standing next to her, agreeing with the craziness of the situation. At 15, Erlbaum was constantly being blamed by her mother and later, social workers, for not fixing situations that were clearly not of her own making.When Erlbaum is told that her mother is pregnant with her abusive ex-boyfriend's child, she listens in shock as her mother tells her, \\"The fact is that Dave and I are going to have a baby and we are going to try and be a family.\\" She sounded like she was speaking from notes. \\"Now we've talked about getting couples therapy, and that's definitely something we're going to think about. But for right now, I want you to pitch in a little more and help us all get along better.\\"This coming from a mother who's already worked out with her daughter when it's OK to call the cops in the middle of a fight and when it's not. Charming. Who's the adult there?Again and again, Erlbaum is forced to decide whether or not her mother can be trusted, if THIS TIME things will be different. Her thoughts at times like these are such a heart-rending mix of scared little girl and world-weary adult.\\"I could not possibly be falling for this again. I was like Charlie Brown and the football. Like a duckling who could never be retrained, I would waddle straight off a cliff, following her. She threw away your clothes when you left home, it said on my index card. She told Poulos you were insane. She's done this to you eight hundred times already.\\"So I feel a great deal of empathy for her...but because I come from a different life than hers, I can't get my mind around the HUGE amount of drugs she does. I just shake my head as the pot turns into cocaine, that turns into PCP, that turns into Ecstasy.... Again, I didn't have the life she did, I didn't grow up in New York, live in a shelter... I guess at the end of the day, I can just hang on for the ride, and be grateful it was her life and not mine...and be glad that I know she became a stronger person for living through what she did.I guess the only other thing I can say is that I never really found out, in either of Janice Erlbaum's books, what finally made her stronger. What made her give up the REALLY bad drugs and what finally made her stop smoking pot...and what gave her the strength to make better choices? I feel like I know where she came from and where she ended up (at least as of now)...but I'm missing something in the middle. I know the What and the How...but not the why.But - who's to say that's any of my business. It's not my life, after all..."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"This account summerizes the very immediate women's issue; their struggle for their own place and safety. The troubled teenager's journey to winning her own place against all odds was also a struggle for early independence and self awarenesse.The trouble that I found on the way was the editorial one; the book consists of two parts and the latter part read as a departure from the theme of 'halfway homelessness' as the book had initially picked up. Later I learned why all the sequence of events were brought together. Still, the whole structure should have been improved, or could be two different projects. The false impression somehow endured even after I had aknowleded why the latter part was integral.By the end, the author recognized how important it was for her to prioritize her independence over her boy craze so that she would not have to repeat the same mistake hwe mother had made. She had put herself in the situation exactly same as her mom put her to, from where she had had ran away initially. It was then that I thoght I understood better the whole point and the significance of the experiences, why it had to cover all the trouble she went through even after her mom had removed the wrong step dad from the household, who was supposed to be the cause of all the hardship in her life. She came to terms that it was her and her mom's dependent mind set on men that1) could not cease the troubled relationship with the step-dad who put the whole family into abyssand2) made the author move in with her boyfriend without spending any time in the newly regained stepdad free environment.She leaned the lesson and got her very own room in the end and exorcized the demon running in the family. That is the whole point of the author's journey to the real independence, which equates a safe environment any woman should deserve.The book offers a good look at the loophole of the welfare system and the institutional defects as well as the women's rights' and its limitation back in 80's. Or, I am wondering if we are in any better shape or have made no progress after two decades in terms of the women's condition. Any girl has to learn to put herself first at the 'risk' moment, especially when her mom does not teach how to do so and when. The hard won wisdom and lots of guts are the education that Girlbomb offers to today's youth and women."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Up until page 100 I found the book very slow.. But once you make it past page 100 it gets pretty good!!! With love triangles and overcoming family dynamics!"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"As I read the first few chapters of the book, I found myself thinking that the author brought her homelessness on herself, and that just because she didn't like her mother's boyfriend did not give her license to run away from home. As I continued reading, I realized that maybe she did have some regrets about leaving home, and was just acting the way any rebellious teenager would act. It is an interesting read though, and a first-hand look inside the mind of a teenage girl."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I read this book a few years ago. I was stunned when I learned the real struggle of being on the street, especially in a big city. This book will definitely hold your attention. It is honest, raw, and sad. It is always a relief when the person is still around to write about it though. I told the author how much I liked her book and she actually replied, which I thought was pretty cool. For anyone looking for first-hand insight on what its like to be a homeless addict, I recommend this book. I think it is good to know that these are real people, and this is exactly the type of book that can shed light on the real problems so many teens face here in the U.S. A great read."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Very good voice. Kept my interest. Will await more books by this author!Really want good things for Janice. Hope her life turns out positive."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Erlbaum can write fairly well, but this memoir doesn't stand out from the countless other memoirs about troubled teens. There is an interesting conflict within the way her story is told: The reader is immersed into Erlbaum's life as a directionless teen, yet the story is never compelling. There is little to no delving beneath the surface of Janice's life or the lives of those who surround and influence her. There were several people and situations that could have been explored (Hope's abusive mother, the young women in the shelter), and doing so would have added much needed depth to her story. Instead the memoir is written in the voice of a self-absorbed teen. Maybe Erlbaum was too successful in recapturing this period in her life; it was difficult to remain interested or to sympathize with teen Janice's constant partying and reckless, predictable decisions.The title is misleading. As the author says, \\"...I never spent a single night without a place to sleep, for which I am supremely grateful...\\" 'Partially Parented' would be a more apt title, as Erlbaum was certainly at the mercy of her mother's volatile love life and selfish behavior. Erlbaum's relationship with her mother also could have been further examined. This may have given the reader more insight into Erlbaum's life.I continued reading hoping that at some point the book would become the poignant memoir of an at-risk teen that it is touted as being. This never happened. Frankly, it was a chore to see Girlbomb to the bitter end. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"Look at the cover for a few moments. Does it compel you to want to read it? Does it pique your interest?No?Neither does the interior of the book, in my opinion. A girl moves out at sixteen, (grows up fast) boozes and sexes it up while hanging out with runaways and other stoners. The narrative has little to no humor, only a few memorable scenes, none captivating, and describes mostly partying, girl-girl drama and hanging out. The author's attempt to develop the I-gotta-get-outta-here scenario leading up to her \\"running away falls short and the reader gets the sense that the author's leaving home was more so she could party than anything else. I don't rate memoirs based on my opinion on the protagonist's decision making or character (as some reviewers tend to do), but rather on the interest of the prose. The book never inspired or entertained me. Two stars because most memoirs I've read are simply more interesting.Disclaimer: I am a man, not a woman, so maybe a woman would read it differently."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I just finished this book and have to say, yes, it is worth reading. It's often uncomfortably honest and describes moments we've probably all had, but have yet to see in print. I appreciated the vernacular throughout - which added to the realism. The memoir also speaks of an era where younger kids had better access to hard drugs - the 80s. I can't help think what Jan's experience would be like if she were a teenager today. Good luck to the author and her bright future."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I am 15 and when I read this book I couldn't get past the description of Janice's mother and stepfather.

Read it for yourself. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I'm kind of glad that I read Janice Erlbaum's second memoir, Have You Found Her, first. It allowed me to read her first one and not have to worry too much that she got seriously hurt. Or went crazy, which is what I think I would have done in her circumstances. Instead, Erlbaum left home, and turned to drugs and sex as a teenager, and she relates her experiences with both with a candor that is unapologetic at the same time it is tinged with regret.Erlbaum's problems at this time of her life seem to stem from a combination of poor parenting and poor decision-making. Unfortunately, neither the shelter nor the group home into which she is placed seem well-equipped to really help her with either of those problems. It almost seems as though by leaving home she's gone from the frying pan into the fire. It all catches up with her at the end, though, and at the close of this memoir we begin to see the more mature woman that we got to know in her second memoir. I hope she writes a third so that we can continue to share her story."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"It took me a while to get around to reading this, but when I finally picked it up, I was captivated. Erlbaum is a wonderful writer, she's sarcastic and amusing, which is the best way to write this sort of depressing material. She paints detailed pictures of all the people around her, from the various characters at her group home to the complicated dynamics between her and her two best friends, and of New York at that time for a messed-up group of teens - that is, drugs (she gets addicted to cocaine and manages to quit). She also makes herself into a sympathetic character; I was so depressed while I was reading this, and that only happens with characters I care about.So to sum up: great writing, great story, great book. Definitely recomended."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I flew through this book. It's a straightforward account of the author's teen years, which were insane, when compared to my teenage years. She tried everything once. Or several times.

Clearly, things turned out OK for her because she published this book, but I would have liked to find out where she was 5 or 10 years later or if she slipped up again before finally getting straightened out."},{"Title":"Girlbomb: A Halfway Homeless Memoir","review":"I was thrilled (but not surprised*) by the fluidity of the prose. I couldn't put it down. It's an easy read. It's engaging. You're constantly wondering what Janice is going to do next. It's a real page-turner. ... a highly descriptive tale of being a teenager in the New York of the 80's.Note: The book is unapologetic about her drug use, sexual freedom and other life choices. They were just a fact of her experience. A parent might want to read it first, if they find these topics unacceptable. Personally, I am giving this to my 16 y.o. niece. I believe my teenage niece has a solid grasp on what is healthy for her. This story is about a brave young woman who made some good choices and other not-so-good choices. It's reality. It's life. The heroine is very courageous. I think all teenagers need the encouragement that this book provides - the courage to face your fears and face the choices you must make. Growing up is scary.While reading, I was sometimes very jealous. Janice got to go to Danceteria and hang out in Washington Square when she cut class. Meanwhile, her mother blithely let her check into a group home. I was never as brave as Janice. Unlike Ms. Erlbaum, it took me years and years to finally find \\"home.\\"Like me, her friends were fake and the teenage Janice was sometimes a complete jerk. High School can truly suck, in every era and any location. We can all relate - even if your teenage years seem so much more or less \\"damaging\\" in comparison.

Because the book is written by ancient prophets who had struggles similar to ours, the teachings can be likened very easily to your own life, I guess that this makes it the best \\"How to\\" life ones life book there is.There have a lot of other books been written about the Book of Mormon, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Joseph smith etc, But if one truly wants to understand the Church and/ or the Book of Mormon, nothing beats, getting down to the core and reading the Book of Mormon itself.

Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I disliked it, I grew up reading from it as a family, confident that it was an uplifting a book as any other, but I hadn't put it to the test . . . hadn't built my own testimony of it. It wasn't until I was 20 and I moved out on my own that I really decided to start a real prayerful study of the book. I now love the Book of Mormon. I've grown in my appreciation of the Savior through my prayerful study of this book. And that is why I read this book, and the Bible, to grow closer to God.I would encourage anyone who is seeking to find out more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to read this book, and if possible, the &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot; and the &quot;Pearl of Great Price,&quot; as well as the Holy Bible. These three books, along with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; create the four books of canonized scripture of the LDS faith. I understand that you'd want to read outside sources on the Church as well, as any well-rounded scholar would, just let common sense be your guide. There are many non-LDS writers who are not in agreement with the teachings of the LDS church, who write fair, well researced books. On the otherhand there are those who write hateful, misleading books that pervert that which is most sacred to me. Anyone who would claim to be a caring Christian and then belittle and mock those who believe differently then they do, needs to reexamine their intent, and should be viewed with suspicion by those looking to research.I know one of the main questions of those who are unfamiliar with the LDS church is whether or not we're Chrisitans. From my point of view, I worship the Son of God as my Savior, my Redeemer and King, and I believe that through him all mankind can be redeemed. I believe He has taught me on how to live, to be charitable to my fellow man, forgiving, to be filled with hope and faith. To pray when I am weak, and to pray when I am strong. To lift those up who are around me, to love all those I come in contact with, and mostly, striving daily to become a better person today then I was yesterday.If that's not Christian, I don't know what else I'd want to be.God bless America, and all those who have died in the senseless tragedy in New York and Washington."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read The Book of Mormon and I know that it is true. The book contains great insight into our Heavenly Father's plan for us, and compliments the Bible as another testimony of Christ's divinity. How do I know it is true? I know because I tried the promise given in the book of Mormon itself. The promise found in Moroni 10:3-5 (The Book of Mormon is set up like the Bible in books, chapters and verses, thus this would be found in the book of Moroni, tenth chapter, verses three through five) says that if we read the book, ponder it in our heart and then ask God if they are true. If we do these things, we will recieve an answer. I know it's true."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon has had a wonderful influence for good in my life.

It is a powerful book that compliments--but does not replace--the Bible. I humbly give it my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"It is a challenge to read at times because of the archaic language, but once you get past that it is an excellent piece of literature. My only complaint is that you don't need to buy it when you can get it for free from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints online. You can also get it from just about any Mormon you ask for one."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Do not believe anything negative that you have \\"heard\\" about this book until you have read it for yourself. Perhaps the most misunderstood book on earth, The Book of Mormon is simply another testament of Jesus Christ and tells of a people from 600 years before His birth until 400 years A.D. It simply and beautifully testifies that Jesus really is the son of God and supports all that the Bible has taught us concerning His life. It was not \\"authored\\" by Joseph Smith, only translated by the power of God through Joseph Smith, as the book will explain. It is an ancient,spiritual record of the native american people and their understanding of Jesus Christ and His eventual visitation after He was crucified. They witness the new star at his birth and the earthly calamity of his death. There are few words more beautiful than those in the chapters where He visits them and shows them the prints from the nails in His hands and feet, and proclaims who He is and then teaches them all he taught the people in Jerusalem when he was walking among them. Your heart will tell you that the account is absolute truth. It is a must read for anyone who is seeking to further their understanding of the Savior and the purpose of life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"What an amazing book to have on Amazon.com! The truth of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ is now found here.If you have seen a Latter-day Saint Temple, you have seen the angel Moroni atop. If you have wondered what this statue is, and who it depicts, you can find out by reading the Book of Mormon. He is the ancient prophet who helped Joseph Smith bring forth the Book of Mormon for us to have in our day.Like they say on Reading Rainbow...\\"but you don't have to take my word for it...\\" Heed Moroni's promise, Moroni 10:4.

For that reason I will continue to reread it."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God.

I suggest the book if you want to become a better person, if you want to know God and Christ better and if you want to feel better about your future and the world you live in now. No other book is more inspiring and true.Anyone who truely reads the Book of Mormon looking to determine it's validity must meet a few requirements. One: an open mind, two: a desire to truely know, and three: help from above.Without an open mind you may be persuaded by what other people have said. Without a desire you miight as well be reading the newspaper.

The first time as a skeptic, he second time as seeker of truth and third time as a committed believer. This book will change your life forever and bring you closer to God and His Son, Jesus Christ. While I have always been a Christian, my wife and a foster son came from different non-christian religions traditions. Both were converted to belief in the Lord Jesus Christ by the Book of Mormon. This book lives up to its title page when it says that it is to the \\"convincing of Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ\\". The Bible is correct when it says that \\"all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine\\". Truly, this book is scripture as is the Bible and it stands as \\"Another Witness of Jesus Christ\\"."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Anyone interested in American Religous history must read this book. Joseph Smith founded Americas greatest religous movement, and it is predicted by 2050 the Mormon Church will be the worlds biggest religous movement since the advent of Islam. And of course the Book of Mormon is Joseph Smiths greatest work. Anyone who is a believer in the divinity of Jesus Christ should find this a very inspiring book. The book is very Christ centered which certainly shows Joseph Smiths very deep belief in Christian ideas (although Joseph Smith did believe that modern Christian churches had become corrupted with false doctrines). The book is highly complex and shows forth astounding consistency. I have seen that many people bring up the fact that Mark Twain was not impressed with the book. I believe that Mark Twain was likely jealous that he could not produce something this complex. Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn are great but nothing in comparison with the Book of Mormon. Nor can those who bring this up write anything close to it. For those who are not interested in the intellectual history of religon will probably find this a boring read. And I know some superstitious people think the book is anti-Christ, Occultic, and that Joseph Smith started a satanic cult. This shows there lack of education into even what these words mean, shows there lack of intelligence, and shows there lack of appreciation into American history. I would recommend also the mountain of recent studies done on the Book of Mormon. From a very pro-Mormon point of view I would recommend the works done by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies found at [local website] They are many times apolegetic but they have produced a mountain of literary studies into the Book of Mormon. From a more secular view of the Book of Mormon I would recommend works that have been published by Signature Books, found at [local website]"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I am grateful for the witness that believing Christians can obtain and strengthen from this additional Testament of Jesus Christ.Nephi, Alma, Mormon and Moroni all become new witnesses along side Peter, Paul and John.

As I traveled to a weekend assignment, I took with me an unusual book which was my constant companion. I could lay it down only to sleep, eat, and change trains. It fascinated me, captivated me, and held me spellbound with its irresistible charm and engaging interest. I have read it many times.\\"As I finished it, I closed the book and sat back, absorbed as I relived its contents. Its pages held me, bound me, and my eyes were riveted to them. I knew the book was factual, but as has been said, \`Truth is stranger than fiction.' . . .\\"I found in it life at its best and at its worst, in ever-changing patterns. I hardly recovered from one great crisis until another engulfed me. . . .\\"This dramatic story is one of the greatest ever played by man. . . .\\"Its story has a vital message to all people. . . .\\"Archaeologists may be excited as they read of ruins of ancient cities, highways, and buildings. . . .\\"Journalists will find in this book crisis after crisis, presenting rich material for limitless climactic stories. . . .\\"This unparalleled book should intrigue navigators. . . .\\"The student of economics will find in this unusual book the disintegration of nations through pride, soft living, and luxuries, terminating finally in hunger and fetters. . . .\\"The astronomer and geologist here may see signs in the heavens and new stars come into focus, three days without sun . . . nights without darkness . . . and a vapor of darkness so impenetrable that no glimmer, nor candles, nor torches, nor fire could give any light. . . .\\"Engineers will learn . . . that . . . centuries ago, men erected buildings, temples, and highways with cement. . . .\\"The psychologists may find studies in human behavior and the workings of the human mind and the rationalizing processes where men convince themselves that \`good is bad, and that bad is good.' . . .\\"The educator will find treasures of literature and poetry. . . .\\"This comprehensive book should be studied by politicians, government leaders, kings, presidents, and premiers to see the rise and fall of empires, and the difference between statesmanship and demagoguery. . . .\\"Scientists will read of unusual instruments never patented or remade or duplicated, of elements which, without recharging, illuminate dark spaces indefinitely. . . .\\"Military men may learn much in strategy, intrigue, in movements, in morale. . . .\\"But after all, it is not the book's dramatic crises, its history, its narrative that are so important, but its power to transform men into Christlike beings worthy of exaltation.\\"It is the word of God.

I was 19 when I joined, the son of a family that was Christian, but not rooted in any one faith. As my father was in the military, we moved around a lot, and as a result I had the opportunity to look into quite a few Protestant denominations. I have also been fascinated by ancient American archaeology and the legends of the indigenous peoples of the New World since I was about ten years old, particularly those stories of a bearded white god that visited anciently.My first reading of the Book of Mormon confirmed what I had come to believe, that Jesus Christ visited the New World in ancient times. Since that first reading in my nineteenth year I have taken the opportunity to investigate the veracity of the Book of Mormon not only from a spiritual but an academic standpoint. I have taken the opportunity to study a few languages, to learn a bit more ancient American folklore and I have made sure to study non-Mormon writings as frequently as possible. In my studies I have found that at least a few of the original inhabitants of the New World practiced a monotheistic religion, and that not all were the stereotypical pagans our \\"history\\" (with the help of Hollywood) has taught us.I believe the Book of Mormon to be what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints purports it to be: It is inspired Scripture, written anciently by New World Prophets and translated by Joseph Smith, Jr. My faith in this book is not built on, but bolstered by, my academic studies, for only a spiritual witness can verify the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.Read this book, and read it with your Bible close by, for the Book of Mormon is a companion to the Bible, not a replacement of it.

Good luck! It changed My attitude towards religion, prophets, and getting guidance for my life."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"There are two issues with the Book of Mormon. The first is whether or not it is &quot;true&quot;. For the reader who is credulous enough to believe that the myths in the Bible are accurate history, then they might be able to convince themselves that the Book of Mormon is true. For the reader who has a neuron of prudent skepticism in his brain, the answer to whether or not the Book of Mormon is true is painfully obvious. Judge for yourself.The second issue with the Book of Mormon is its quality as a piece of literature. If the reader has a predisposition towards Christianity, some of the issues it raises are mildly interesting. It's interesting to consider who, specifically Jesus was referring to when he said he had other sheep. It's interesting to learn that children who haven't been baptized aren't going to hell. It's interesting to hear from Christianity that the purpose of life is to have joy. It's interesting to think that people had a crystal clear understanding of Christianity before Jesus was even born. It's interesting to consider that the true religion is more widely available than usually thought.But, the few &quot;interesting&quot; ideas are drowning in prose that tries to sound like King James and painfully fails. When the author suffered from writer's block as he frequently did, he copied from the Bible whole chapters at a time (and he usually chose boring chapters of the Bible rather than relatively interesting ones!). The characters are one-dimensional and homogenous. When the &quot;Lamanites&quot; (the supposed ancestors of the American Indian) speak, the Indian clich&eacute;s tend to make your skin crawl. The plot is repetitious and unbelievable. The dialogue is uncompelling. The logical arguments are unsound. It's a long, tedious read.Perhaps I am being too harsh. If you compare it to the Old Testament, I suppose it holds its own. But if you compare it to great Western literature, be it Homer, St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Emerson, or Charles Dickens, it is totally and utterly out-classed. A unique epic? Yes. Great literature? Not even average literature.Among the relatively good chapters are 2 Nephi 2, Mosiah 2, Alma 29, Alma 36, and the second half of 1 Nephi 4.It's a great book to read when you can't sleep."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Although I am one who regards this book as divine, one of the universal things i love about it is it's poetry.

Hung up on their fears of the book (and their fears of \\"Mormons\\"), they fail to see the good the book, like the Bible, has wrought in the world, and in personal lives.

I don't believe it is what it claims to be, and I did read it 10 years ago when a Mormon coworker gave me a copy. It is usually what Mormon missionaries give potential converts to read, and this is somewhat misleading, since the Book of Mormon has nothing to do with the organization and beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon church). It is supposedly about Christ visiting the people of the Americas shortly after his resurrection, and it is full of rather innocuous stories with moral values and lessons that would be hard for any Christian to argue with. That is exactly WHY Mormons use it as a missionary tool. If you really want to know how the LDS church is organized, you need to read the Book of Doctrines and Covenants, ISBN 0830902775. That is where the cat gets out of the bag. There you will learn about how and why the church baptizes the dead, marries for eternity, believes in premortal existence, first instituted and then renounced plural marriage, and how Mormons believe that man can ultimately achieve godhood. But as for the Book of Mormon, I give it 3 stars, because even if you don't believe it is divinely inspired, the stories are interesting and above-average in quality, and if you do believe it is divinely inspired it is much more."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is an amazing hidden treasure of the history of the ancient people in America.

More than that, it evokes deep passion, a passion that jumps out through many of the reviews posted here.My journey with the Book of Mormon has been the amazing journey of my life. I first read the book in its entirety when I was eight years old. What I got from it was a child's recognition that it had some pretty far-out, God-centered stories. But in time, as I majored in literature and began to read and ponder it on a more mature level, I became fascinated with its more complex nature. On one level, it can be read and partly understood by a child. But this book, like a good video game, will take you as many levels deep as you want to go with it, and give back in direct proportion to what you put into it. There are complex, intricate Hebraic poetic forms that, when fully understood (if that's possile) reveal its writers as among the world's most gifted, virtually all of them pointing the reader toward Jesus Christ. The depth and breadth of my journey with this book has truly been the amazing journey of a lifetime. I recommend it. But be prepared! Like me, it may take you on a longer, deeper journey than you ever thought possible and still leave much to ponder and explore.Here are some (but by no means all) of the highlights of my own journey with the book.1. The journey of Lehi and his family found in the book of 1 Nephi. The Book of Mormon appropriately begins with this, an allegory of each of our life's journeys. The only other think I know like it is Homer's \\"Odyssey.\\" However, unlike \\"Odyssey\\" this journey is a family journey, not an individual one. \\"Families together\\" is a great Mormon (perhaps universal?) theme that begins here.2. Also in the book of 1 Nephi is the allegory of the Tree of Life. This powerful allegory has been depicted in the artwork of many cultures the world over. Its universal theme is better explained in the Book of Mormon than anywhere else I know.3. In the book of 2 Nephi Chapter 4 is the powerful idea that even \\"wretched\\" people (as Nephi calls himself) are loved by God and may in fact be favored by Him and even share His secrets and speak for Him. Although written before the New Testament Apostle Paul wrote, this message has Pauline echoes to it.4. In the book of Mosiah is an address given by a king amid all the ancient Hebrew tradition, pomp, circumstance, etc. with two powerful messages: 1) That beggars should never be turned away, since we all, even kings, are \\"beggars\\" unable by ourselves to produce even the breath of life; and 2) that when one is in the service of fellow beings he/she is only in the service of God. These two messages are ironically spoken by a king and echo the words of another king, Jesus Christ, in the New Testament.5. The book of Alma contains some of the most profound words and ideas in the English language. I'm particularly taken by Alma Chapter 32, where Alma compares the \\"Word\\" (Jesus Christ) to a seed, then gives the best formula for how an unbeliever/seeker can become a believer of which I'm aware. Alma, together with Nephi, is a master of Hebraic poetic forms and wording. Its no coincidence, I think, that their books are among the largest in the Book of Mormon. Alma writes beautifully of many other universal human themes too numerous to mention here.6. The book of III Nephi contains the most sublime language describing the love of Christ I've read. Even though the words have undoubtedly suffered some from translation, they are hard to read (or even think about) without bringing tears. What love this man/God has!7. Chapter 12 of the book of Ether contains what for me is a TRULY BIG idea and one full of hope: That human weaknesses are gifts from God to keep us humans from becoming too full of ourselves and that, if we turn to Christ, he'll help make those weaknesses into strengths. I know of no other place this idea is found.8. Last (but not least) the book of Moroni has given me the surest advice of how to discern between good and evil. If a thing brings me closer to Christ, it is good. If it takes me further away, it is not good. That's pretty simple. Even I have been able to understand that. This book also (in Chapter 10, verses 4 and 5) gives the assurance that the best way to test the truth of something is to read about it, ponder it, then ask God \\"in the name of Christ.\\" If it is true, you'll feel good about it inside. But only if you give room enough to ponder before sincerely asking. This idea is echoed, though less explicitly, in the New Testament: \\"Seek and ye shall find,\\" and \\"if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.\\"(James 1:5)So, these are some of the highlights of my journey with the Book of Mormon. Its been a wonderful, gradual, ever deepening awakening over a lifetime of reading, studying and comparing. Its powerful language and intricate poetic forms are just now being discovered and understood. I'm most appreciative of the wonder, the passion, and the hope the book has given \\"wretched\\" me and a few million others."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"This is an incredible Book.

This book has helped me many times when I have been seeking spiritually for answers, and I have found that it goes hand in hand with the Bible in clarifying God's plan for us. I would encourage anyone who is seeking answers as to the Book of Mormon's validity, to not be swayed by the words of any man, but to read from the book itself, pondering what it teaches, and then turning to God in heartfelt prayer to know if it is true.

It came to me at a time when I was searching for a greater meaning and through this book I found it. I have heard many critics of the book but they are consistantly people who are uninformed, havent read the book or have something to gain by condemnation. But being one who has read, is informed (on both sides) and has absolutly nothing to gain I will tell you my opinion. This book is a beautiful tale of a family. Of love and hate, faithfulness and betrayal. It tells a wonderful story about the realtionship this family and its progenitors have with God. Many joys and many tragedies. In the end it is a story that gives us all hope. The amazing part is .... it's true! Not a work of fiction. It tells me that God is mindfull of not only the Jews - his chosen people - from whom we received the Bible, but he knows all his children throughout the world. The Bible is a beautiful account of how God loved and cared for a people who lived far, far away and long, long ago and i love the book but I also love the Book of Mormon because it tells about God's love for another family who lived not quite so long ago and not very far away at all. I read the book and I wanted to know for myself if what I was reading was true so I went to the \\"Source\\". I prayed. I knew that if there was an answer He would tell me. It was improtant for me to know because the message is so sweet but I couldnt beleive unless I had a witness from heaven. The witness came. It can come to you too. Because of this book I am closer to God and my faith in Christ is now unshakable. He died for ALL people. He came here (to America) to His \\"other sheep\\"(John 10:16) And if He would do that, make that kind of effort for them, then He will come to me too!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I love to read The Book of Mormon.

It definitely is another testiment of Jesus Christ. It talks of ancient people here in the Americas before the Native Americans and how through pride and rebellion they lost their faith in Christ and eventually were elliminated from the Earth.

I highly recommend that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a collection of the writings of ancient American prophets. It teaches many beautiful and important truths about God which confirm the Bible and also gives greater light on important subjects that will help us grow closer to God and learn more of his will. The mere existence of the Book of Mormon also demonstrates another truth which should be obvious, but which most people have never really considered- that God loves and remembers all of his children and therefore gives all of his children the same opportunity to learn his saving truths. The Bible demonstrates that God blessed the people who lived thousands of years ago in the Middle East by sending them prophets to teach his word. The Book of Mormon shows that he also remembered those who lived in ancient America by giving them prophets so that they could have these same truths. And by giving us prophets today (including Joseph Smith, who translated the Book of Mormon from its original language by power of God), God demonstrates that he also loves and remembers those of us who live today. Just like people in ancient times, we need prophets in our time who receive revelation directly from God and can teach us God's plan with purity, knowledge and power. And God, in his love and mercy, has called such men in our day so that we need not rely solely upon men's fallible interpretations of former prophets' writings.I recommend the Book of Mormon to everyone who sincerely desires to learn of God. I am persuaded that the Book of Mormon will bring to all those who read it with a sincere heart a greater understanding of God's love and his purposes for his children, a greater appreciation for his plan of happiness, and a greater desire to do good."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"A lot of people believe this book to be the word of God. For them, the spiritual value of this volume is obvious.For everyone else, this book represents the latest significant chapter in the anthology of world religious texts. It illustrates a new and interesting idea of God and man's relationship to him, of the purpose of this life and the nature of the afterlife. It belongs on the shelf right next to the Bhaghavad Gita and the Tao Te Ching and deserves the same respect from religious scholars and anyone else wishing to understand the beliefs of others.Mormonism is one of the fastest growing world religions. Mormons are our neighbors and co-workers. While this book doesn't really help anyone understand why they do a lot of the weird things they do, it goes a long way to helping one understand why they believe what they really believe. Some modern readers may have some minor diffuculty with the 1830's English, but its compelling narrative and brevity make it much easier to digest than most other world religious texts.Many reviewers want to harp on the fact that the book is *false.* Nobody seems to care if the Analects of Confucius are true or false. It's true, the book does make a pretty bold promise. Whether or not that promise pans out, twelve million people today believe it, and over the past hundred years millions more have left homes and families, crossed oceans and plains, and been disowned, defamed, deported, assaulted and killed because they believed it. To me that is more of a challenge than a promise, to take this book seriously, believe it or not."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I'm trying to remember the statistics... I think it was either every 1.5 or every 2.5 verses on average it mentions Jesus Christ (can't remember which), claiming His divinity as the Son of God, our Savior and Redeemer, One with the Father, and the ONLY path to Eternal Life.I've read it countless (litterally dozens and dozens) of times - once in it's entirety in 2 days, and another time in 1 week, but usually I don't just read it - I study it taking months, and cross reference it with similar inspiring Biblical passages, even taking years sometimes to go from the beginning to the end.You can read it all online or get the hardcopy I have for free (why buy one?) right here: http://www.mormon.org/bookofmormon. I've never read the particular above publication of it, but on mine the index is huge and remarkably well done so you can find a passage discussing just about anything.If you want to learn about Christ's life on earth then read the Bible, but if you want to further strengthen you belief of the good message of eternal life that he gave his disciples then read the Book of Mormon. You'll find it is in complete agreement with the Inspired writings of the Bible too - a fact that opponents to mormonism downplay and unconvincingly try to refute.But don't take my word for it - try it for yourself (dig into it too, don't just skim and read someone's \\"selected passages\\"), and then pray about it. Jesus himself said in the bible (Matthew 7:7-11) that doing so (study, pondering, and then asking God) is your best bet for finding truth. Of course, if you know LDS people then you can apply this other test as well: Matthew 7:16-20.

This book clarifies so many of the Christian teachings that most contemporary organized religions make confusing and cloudy. Simply written and constructed, it is unabashedly clear in its doctrine.

Since then, I have read it 6 times (as of this review). Moreover, I have read a heck of a lot of material critical of the text itself (e.g. The Tanners, Evans, Vogel, Metcalfe) Notwithstanding, most, if not all, the attacks are usually based on fraud and/or popular though errant assumptions about the Book of Mormon text that actually do not jive with the text itself.I urge any one interested in the truth to read the Book of Mormon to discover for themselves that it is indeed another testament of Jesus Christ, and to learn of its truthfulness by study and by prayer to God, after \\"testing all things\\" (Acts 17:11)."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I've read this book growing up, and had always been fascinated with the story plots as well as the strength of character exemplified by the good guys. Growing up with these stories made me feel a desire to make myself into someone of strong character. It made me realize that I don't need to be like everyone else. I just need to do what is right. Because of this book, I have decided that when there are times where doing the right thing is hard, it's worth it to do the right thing, even if I get nothing for it.I also can feel the love and the reality of my Savior, Jesus Christ, as I read. The purpose of this book is specifically to testify of Christ and if you are looking for such a testimony you will find it here. If you are looking simply to criticize you will find that as well. If people are capable of criticizing something as perfect as the Savior, they certainly will find things to criticize in anything; including a book, although made through divine inspiration, that is compiled by and is about ordinary human beings. If you read the book, you will find the writers were well aware of their weakness in writing and knew people would read and size the book up, and even misunderstand it, based on their (the writers of the BOM) inability to express things in writing. This difficulty in expressing deep, ineffable feelings does not make the book any less true. Maybe just more misunderstood. You will get as much as you want to get out of it. For those who want to get much out of it, there is much to get because there is truth there. If you are in it to learn more about Jesus Christ and become closer to Him, you will find it invaluable. If not,you are reading a book in which the whole purpose is to bring you closer to Christ and if you're not up for that, maybe this will be an interesting read."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"I have read this book of Mormon and it is the best book I have ever read !

Regardless of what is said by others, the book has given me a greater understanding of Jesus Christ. When I have read it and studied it, I have found a greater ability to resist temptation and I feel a greater love not only for God, but also for those around me.Those that criticize or claim fraud usually dismiss those of us who speak for its authenticity by referencing some obscure historical fact (out of context), citing some anti-Mormon article/book without checking their sources, and/or generally dismissing proponents of the Book of Mormon's truth as brainwashed cult members. (Incidentally, most critics seem to use the term \\"cult\\" rather broadly and are usually unable to offer a definition of what a cult is when asked.) By in large these critics, to paraphrase a recently deceased Mormon leader, are often masking behavioral lapses with intellectual reservations.The intense criticism of the book should in and of itself raise a flag to genuine seekers of truth. If it was so off-base, why has it influenced millions to live in greater conformity with the teachings of Christ?I do not mean any ill will towards those who choose not to believe.

It speaks for itself."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Mormons treat this book as scripture and the Mormon Church wants you to believe that it is in fact both scripture and real history. The science of DNA and modern anthropology says otherwise. Watch out though, Mormon apologists change their story as needed. They are a moving target. For decades Mormon's have been teaching that native Americans are descended from the \\"Lamanite\\" people talked about in this book. Now, much to the chagrin of the average Mormon beleiver the fancy Mormon apologists are back tracking on this with a new \\"limited geography theory\\". Why? Well for one thing DNA evidence that shows the opposite- oops!I was born into the Mormon religion and read the book many times when younger because I was told that it was the righteous thing to do and that I would be spiritually rewarded. Well, it used to put me to sleep no matter how hard I tried to treat it with reverence and stay interested.Now that I am grown up and realize that the book is not what it claims to be, I can in retrospect understand why I was being put to sleep: It is really a very simple minded good-guy/bad-guy story and quite boring. The style is dry and droning. It exists not to entertain, enlighten, or anything else except to get you to join the Mormon church. Oh, and by the way, members in good standing are asked to pay 10% of their income to the church for the rest of their lives so there is a big money thing going on here.Now since this book is part of the whole \\"you can be a god forever in heaven\\" promise that is the Mormon religion, lots of people will let wishful thinking cloud common sense and rationality and buy into it. Ironically, some otherwise smart and educated folks, mostly born into Mormonism, are able to perpetually talk themselves into this stuff in ever more sophisticated and convoluted ways.A better read would be M. Shermer's book \\"Why people believe weird things\\". Shermer also wrote an article \\"Why smart people believe weird things\\" which I think is included as a chapter in his book.The book also plays a psychological trick on you by inviting you to pray to see if it is true. You are promised a special feeling that you are instructed to attribute to the Holy Ghost. It you get any interesting feelings you might feel you have been touched. Otherwise you are implicitly invited to see yourself as too insincere to receive the spiritual witness. So what do you do? For some the answer is try again and again until you can convince yourself that you now feel something and since weird feelings or warm spiritual feelings do occasionally and randomly occure in normal people some people will be \\"converted\\".Of course, now that we have the scientific method and philosophical history to learn from we should be able to realize that this is exactly the wrong way to figure out truth."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"Dear Readers:I was actually surprised that my first review of this book was banned (after being listed for about 2 years). I simply stated (without name-calling or profanity), facts about ol' Joe Smith and his connections to Masonic Lodges and the review was finally censored. Basically this book purports to be a history of ancient people and prophets, and discovered by Joe Smith with the aid of an angel (in New York State), and actual visitation by god the father and son,...jesus christ in a forest near his home (mormons believe god the father, the holy ghost, and jesus are not one but seperate entities). Yes, the &quot;Latter Day Saints&quot; actually believe all this to be true. If you want to read about the connections between Joeseph Smith and the Masons there's plenty of historical information out there to read along with numerous websites. I read a great deal at my University Library and one book written by Mormon scholars called &quot;Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought Vol. 27, No.3. Fall 1994,&quot; went into great detail to prove Smiths involvement with lodges, and other particulars of the church which would make the average Latter Day Saint scratch their head in disbelief. It's all documented and true, and even the Mormons will admit to its validity, (if they're even aware of it, for it's not one of their proud moments in their church history). If you ever attend a Latter-Day Saint church, they never talk about the gray areas in church history, Smith's history, his arrests, his conections to the jewish book of mysticism, sigils, ritual daggers, treasure hunting, Book of Mormon text changes, numerous seer stones, the current president ( not president of church at the time) buying false documents regarding Joseph Smith seeing a white salamander instead of God, (why would he purchase such fantasy if he believed the book of mormon to be true??)...etc, etc ad infinum! All of this is neatly &quot;sweeped under the rug&quot;. Ask a Mormon missionary about anything of this nature and they'll be dumbfounded; I can almost certaintly guarantee it!I thought that the only religious grouping with enough pull and power to ban and edit unwanted facts were the Jews, but now I guess the Mormons have just as much power here on Amazon!

Bonus points if they can get the same members to buy copies of a book they already own in order to push the books sales ranking. Since both Churches are about the same size, and have devoted detractors as well, it could be interesting. Of course, if we said that the members actually had to have read the book in order to vote, that would severely limit the number of Mormons who could participate.As for the Book itself, some say it is a record of the religion and culture of two tribes of people living in the Americas thousands of years ago (some say around the time and location of the Olmecs and Mayans). Others think the book is a modern record of the religion and culture of the upperstate New York in the late 1820's, including the theories then in vogue concerning the origin of the American Indians.Some say it was written by several ancient prophets on metal plates that were buried and preserved in a hill in New York. Others believe it was \\"written\\" in the 1820's by Joseph Smith (he actually dictated it to a scribe).But you'll never know if you don't read it. And in addition to praying about it, I would recommend learning all you can about the circumstances of the translation, the history of Joseph Smith and his family, and the history of ancient America, where the book is set.It should also be noted that the Book of Mormon can be \\"true\\", but that doesn't necessarily mean that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is \\"true\\" as well. One doesn't necessarily follow the other. Linking the two is a common mistake promoted by many well-meaning LDS.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"The Book of Mormon is a work of fiction with its origins in the desire of early nineteenth century Americans to explain the remnants of Native American civilization they were aware of. Finding it incredible that the Indians could have made such a civilization on their own, the author imagined that a group of exiles must have come over from the Holy Land centuries earlier.Just who wrote the Book of Mormon is hard to say. I tend to think Joseph Smith did. Yes, he was uneducated, but he was certainly a smart young man. Considering his later writings, I don't see that the Book of Mormon was beyond his abilities.As far as the merits of the book itself, certainly it has some. The plot takes some interesting turns. As literature, though, the book is frankly dull, especially in the last half. The Book of Mormon deals in black and white: the characters are either wicked or righteous. Real people aren't like that. Whatever Smith's merits as a writer, creating believable and interesting characters wasn't one of them. Unlike real history, the plot of the Book of Mormon also tends to follow a neat path of \\"wickedness leads to destruction\\" every time.Most scientists who are not historians of 19th century America tend to dismiss extreme religious books like the Book of Mormon as beneath their notice. In a way you can hardly blame the scientists, because the Book of Mormon is contrary to pretty much everything that is known today about Native American civilization. However, I think the scientists are wrong to ignore religious works. The Mormons are today a group with serious political power; they are well represented in Washington, especially in the intelligence community. No matter what your own beliefs are, in my opinion it is important to read the works of people you disagree with. If you are a fan of the Book of Mormon, I would urge you to balance it by reading contary views. I would suggest the books \\"Ghost in the Universe\\" by Edis, and \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" by Carl Sagan."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF MORMON: Another Testament of Jesus Christ","review":"for one, about the smithsonian report, they have recently retracted that document, because of the fact that they have found out those things were acurate that they stated were wrong, and the first people on the americas didn't get there in 600 bc, they were there far before that...look at the book of ether, and lastly if a prophet recieves revelation from God, and another prophet of God gets the same one...word for word...how is that plagarism? this book is true and i love it"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],C={key:0},E={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",C,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-9fad90b4"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/28.md","filePath":"people/28.md"}'),R={name:"people/28.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
