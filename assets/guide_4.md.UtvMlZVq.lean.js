The details of the aircraft involved,leadership,weather,and combat conditions are all covered in great detail. The opening phases of the Spring 1942 German operation to conquer the Crimea,the German offensive in the Caucaus Mountains (Summer 1942-Spring 1943) and the fighting in Stalingrad proper are also included. Well worth the time and money a great find and a excellent book."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is an excellent book because it focuses on the truly important part of the Stalingrad battle-- the airlift. What is great about this book is that it integrates what is happening on the ground with what happened in the air. I've read many books on Stalingrad, Milch, Richthofen, and the author has done his research (see the German Reports from the USAF Air University). Why did the airlift fail? Probably weather and operational readiness were the main reasons. For example, in the Conclusion of the book, the author notes that with better weather a couple of months later, the German Air Force was able to resupply the German Armies in the Caucausas with the 500 tons/day that Stalingrad never received. The Germans were not prepared to operate well at 0 degF and low visibility conditions. By contrast the USAF was able to operate the Berlin Airlift with 5000 tons/day (about 20 times the German tonnage) because of better aircraft (DC-4), better all weather landing systems, and better operational readiness (and no 0 degF weather).What would have been a good additional chapter would have been a comparison of the Stalingrad airlift with Demyansk airlift, Kuban airlift and Berlin airlift. Also some charts showing the tons carried, total planes, operational planes, plane losses per week would have been informative. Nevertheless, this book is a 5 star."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"As I stated in the title of my review the book covered many air operations from the Crimean battles of 1941-1942 up to Stalingrad. The author did this in a very detailed and accurate study and much more important in conjunction with land operations. I was particulary impressed by the coverage of Stalingrad battle (support of the initial assault, Operation Wintergewitten and the airlift), but also the coverage of the air and sea battles over the Black Sea. Very good photos but I cannot say the same about the maps.

It has good background information speciffically about the economic side of it. Decisions made based on oil supply's rather than military objectives. Very interesting material.The only bad thing about this book is that the editing comes across as very sloppy. German names are often misspelled or incorrect. It is not Manstein, but von Manstein, not Bock, but von Bock, not Kluge, but von Kluge.Also it is not Count von Sponneck but Graf von Sponneck.

Probably the most interesting part of the book deals with Fliegerfuhrer Sud and it's mission to clear the Black Sea of the Soviet naval presence. Stopped at Stalingrad also deals with the use of air power in the taking of Sevastapol, the actions against the Soviet forces landed on the Kerch peninsula, and the overall use of German airpower in supporting the march on the Don.Hayward also discusses why Hitler felt the Luftwaffe could airlift enough supplies to sustain 6th Army after it was cut off around Stalingrad by Soviet troops.This book is a good case study of how the Luftwaffe operated in tandem with the army and naval forces, and Hayward points to the Luftwaffe as one of the major contributors to Germany's initial successes against the Soviets.I thuroughly enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the tactical air-support role the Luftwaffe played (specifically in the Southern Front of the Eastern Theater of Operations)."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I really love this well produced, carefully documented and fluidly written book of strategy and human conflict, which I read after reading another of this author's exquisite books. This is an equally good book on history's greatest battle. The focus is on air and joint combat - this being how the Luftwaffe coordinated its combat with the army during the early, middle, and joyless final stages of Stalingrad. No-one before has looked at this, at least not to my knowledge.The author does a marvelous job. I found the book very thorough and sometimes so packed with information that I felt overwhelmed. But that it only because this study analyses (expertly) an overwhelming number of squadrons, divisions and troops.No-one seriously interested in Stalingrad has ignored this invaluable book, which is discussed by war-gamers through to military officers (I first heard that this, the authoritative analysis of the Stalingrad air battle and airlift, existed while at the Ecole de Guerre Economique in Paris in 1999). It is used as a textbook in several airforce and military academies, because it is so accurate, original, analytical and definitive."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I bought this book after being highly impressed by the author's ground-breaking book on Horatio, Lord Nelson. In that book, \\"For God and Glory: Lord Nelson and His Way of War\\", the author wrote what I consider the most original analysis of Nelson in fifty years.With that in mind I sought for other books by Joel Hayward. I came across this and immediately noticed its very high customer rating. It appears that other readers consider Hayward a fine writer.Now, having digested what can only be described as a thorough, balanced and highly innovative account of the Stalingrad campaigns and the dreadful airlift, I am persuaded that Hayward may be another John Keegan.This book's strength is its new approach. \\"Everyone knows\\" that Stalingrad was lost because the Luftwaffe let down the army. Yet until Hayward did it, no-one bothered to test this claim or even to chronicle the events from the airforce's perspective.I don't ordinarily read much on the Second World War. The American Revolution and the Napoleonic era are my customary topics. I must admit, however, that reading this book made the age of tanks and aircraft captivating and enlightening.Hayward is also a gifted writer, with a fluid style that made a big book (400 pages of small print) on a complex topic easy and pleasant to read.I encourage you to buy this book. It looks set, like the Nelson book, to become a classic!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"The author analyses the significance of the support provided by the Luftwaffe to the sucess of German operations in Southern Russia in 1942. The analysis is crisp and the critical points well made."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Anthony Beevor's wife and publisher (the well-connected Hon. Artemis Cooper, no less) had her publicity machine whip his good book on Stalingrad into a huge international best-seller. That's perfectly okay. I liked Beevor's book very much, and do commend it to readers. But Beevor's isn't the most authoritative and analytical book on Stalingrad, that frightful, turning-point battle. Joel Hayward's book is! I'm pleased that, while it has never sold as many copies, Hayward's uniquely-conceived book has earned fantastic reviews and been quoted and acknowledged as highly-influential (and mandatory reading) by almost every subsequent writer on the eastern front, including Glantz, Erickson etc.Hayward's book masterfully explains why, strategically, Hitler planned a major campaign in 1942 after not winning in the east during the previous year. It superbly elucidates why, even though the city of Stalingrad was never one of that major campaign's goals, Hitler then became distracted by it, to the point whereby its capture mattered more than the Caucasus oilfields he was originally, and very rationally, committed to seizing and exploiting.Hayward's book also analyses air power and joint-service matters but always relates these in a seamless way to ground battles and operations. His book is therefore strikingly-different to all previous, army-focused books on Stalingrad (including Beevor's) which barely mentioned air power despite it dominating all successful battles during 1942, in and around Stalingrad itself, and during the air-lift.Hayward's analysis of that increasingly-futile and tragic air-lift, and its highly skilful defeat by the Red Air force and Red Army, is by far the most original, complete, meticulously-researched (all from unpublished archival sources) and informative ever written.I cannot recommend this original, insightful book highly enough. Buy Beevor's journalistic book, of course. But you must buy this volume if you want a thorough, analytical, scholarly work that explains why things happened and what it all meant."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"Recently I ordered 'Stopped at Stalingrad' from amazon.com.

This book didn't, although I did shiver when I read about the horrible winter airlift attempted by the Germans in white-out conditions.I really enjoyed how literate the author was. So many writers today seem to have trouble telling a story and keeping it engaging. Mr Hayward had no such trouble. He's a born writer, I'd say.This is a long and very thorough book, but well worth ploughing through. I commend the author for bringing alive the dismal tasks their idiot leader Hitler expected ordinary pilots and soldiers to do.Yes, buy this fine book!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"In 1942 the German campaign in the Soviet Union was in big trouble. The Germans had fought off the Soviet winder offensive in 1941 but they had not been able to bring their force level back to the same levels as when they had started the campaign. The question was simply what could they do to win?Hitler with the support of the general staff decided on a strategic campaign. One that would aim at cutting Soviet industry off from its supply of oil and also cutting the major rail links. This offensive was given some assistance by the Soviets who launched and enormous and disasterous offensive around Kharkov freeing the way for the German break through.The Germans started to march towards Stalingrad and the Soviets waited. They thought that the Germans were going to attack Moscow again and that the German offenisve was a prelude to a swing north.The strategic reality of the situation was that the Germans put their armies deep in Soviet Territory were they were impossible to supply. In addition the Germans split their attacking force with the sixth army besieging Stalingrad and the rest headed off into the Caucuses. In reality the Germans had put their under supplied armies into a noose. When the German sixth army was surrounded they did not have suffucient fuel or ammunition to do anything but to hang on till an eventual surrender.This book is basically a re-writing of the campaign from the point of view of the German Air Wing. Some memoirs have come to light or alternately this is the first time they have been used. The diary in question is that of Richtofen the commander of air operations over the sixth army.The book is interesting as it suggests that the Germans could have used their air power to destroy the Soviet Oil production as the offensive brought them within range. However they failed to do so as they were confident of victory in the theatre and hoped to use the oil production themselves. (An absurdity as they had no possible way of moving oil from Grozny to Europe.)The book is interesting in a number of ways. The concentration on the importance of the air war is new. However in the past most discussions of the Stalingrad operation have been centred around discussions about whether Hitler acted rationally in not allowing the Sixth Army to stay put. This book explains the rational of the operation and talks in a realistic way about the supply and other problems which made the operation a crock from the start. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is certainly one the most gripping stories of the Second World War. Using a vast array of primary sources and war diaries, including that of the famous Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, Hayward's dramatic account of the 1942 German drive into southern Russia is impressive in its scholarship. Comprehensive scholarship combined with well crafted prose makes this a great read for anyone interested in the Second World War and, in particular, the fiery cauldron of Stalingrad. I don't know of any other book on the Eastern Front in which combined land and air operations are so comprehensively detailed. This book has supplanted older narratives and analyses of the battle for Stalin's city on the Volga River, and is an indispensable resource on my bookshelf. Thoroughly recommended!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"This book is damned good!

I am impressed by the fantastic research, the breadth of analysis, the originality of the arguments and the readibility of the text.This is the best book on a single air campaign I have ever read. While it is a tad too detailed in places, which one expects from an academic historian, it reveals so much that I did not know before (even though I though I knew a great deal about Stalingrad) that I can't help but be impressed.I have read books by James Corum and Horst Boog, who are the leading Luftwaffe historians in the world. Both scholars were involved in this book, according to the achnowledgements, which doesn't surprise me.

The one interesting thing which the other reviewers have not alluded to is an examination of the importance of oil in the German and Soviet war effort and an analysis of the reason why Hitler struck off towards the oil fields in at Baku.The discussion of this subject made it possible to understand the dynamics of the tactics and one can now realise how close the Germans came to victory even though their forces were much weaker than in the previous summer."},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"'Stopped at Stalingrad' is easily the best book to show in action the German concept of creating 'Schwerpunkte', single points of military focus. Stalingrad, as the writer shows, was never meant to be such a point. But Hitler made it one, and the rest is history.This book is the definitive chronicle and assessment of the Stalingrad air-lift, the greatest and most strategically important such operation in history.Why did it commence, only to fail so dismally? This book explains for the first time in English and the best in any language.I am no more than an average student of the German language, but even I can see and feel impressed by the writer's unprecedented use of original German archival sources as the basis of analysis. From records of the almost-unknown German Black Sea Fleet, to the documents of the Nazi state's economics ministry, to the fascinating personal diaries of Richthofen, Milch, Fiebig and other officers, this book uses rare and sometimes never-before-used sources.I'm persuaded by the writer's argument that the German Heer (army) succeeded in reaching Stalingrad and deep into the Caucasus only because of masterly planned and executed ground attack, close air support and aerial resupply --- all by the Luftwaffe. I'll never again be content reading the traditional army-centric portraits that the army was the main means of attack and the Luftwaffe was merely a weaker help-mate. Hayward firmly demolished that myth.I cannot say enough about this heavyweight piece of military assessment. It has gained an outstanding international reputation as a must-have, cannot-do-without campaign assessment, and I can only state that this reputation is very deserved. A great read!"},{"Title":"Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East, 1942-1943 (Modern War Studies)","review":"I learned a lot about the Eastern Front Luftwaffe.

I was happy to see that the siege of Sevastopol was well covered, I have found so little information in other books about that epic siege. The book does a very good job in explaining the terrible conditions at the outlying airfields trying to supply the 6th army,the lack of fuel,spare parts and the horrific weather conditions.Hitler decided to try and take the Caucausas oil fields as well as Stalingrad. They had forces to take one,not both. They would have had muchgreater success if they had just bombed the oil fields especially Baku which represented 80% of Russia's oil. Army group A and B could have bypassed Stalingrad,cutting the Volga river traffic and with a pincer movement, enveloped the Russian armies coming to the aid of Stalingrad.Field Marshal's von Bock and List did all they could and were treated unfairly by Hitler.

The different methods this book used to capture the essence of Spirit were brilliant. Those would be: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology. He writes about those archetypal characters that are within your own self, and the dark shadows that you have by which casted a veil between you and the Beloved. That is what is also key to this work, it describes the true Love that is God and that I know is the essence of our full existence and the Ultimate Reality. It is the ocean that is God, and any love that we experience in this life is a glimpse of the ocean of love which is Oneness. And any beauty here on Earth is a reflection of the infinite ocean of beauty that is Oneness. Our goal is to reach that by transforming our inner shadows. Now you might wonder how that archetypal plane is related to reaching Oneness, and that is through the other side of this book: dreamwork. Usually in describing monism and reaching God through the higher levels of reality, dreams are thought of as lower levels than what we experience now. But this author interprets them in light of our Self, which is One with realization of God. I must say that while reading this I felt more deeply suspended into that mystic Oneness."},{"Title":"Catching the Thread: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology","review":"The author uses many threads (Jung, Blake, Edinger, Jacobi, Mother Teresa, Esther Harding, Rumi, St. John of the Cross, etc.) to weave a simple, refreshing, mystical work.

The way of unity for seekers presents a challenge to those consciously pursuing the spiritual life."},{"Title":"Catching the Thread: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology","review":"Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me.

Thus, it is with great pleasure that I state that Dr. Nemata Amelia Blyden's book is bound to be regarded as one of the greatest books on West Africa produced in this decade. This brilliant, synchronic, historical tour de force teaches us about the trans-oceanic migration of West Indians from the Caribbean to Sierra Leone in the decades after slavery was abolished in the British colonies in 1807. Employing both primary and secondary sources, Dr. Blyden in the eight chapters of this book chronicles how the West Indians who immigrated to Sierra Leone during this period came to occupy numerous positions in the colony and the colonial administration; how they became an important minority, albeit not always well-liked; and the impetus for their power and influence. More tantalizing is how Dr. Blyden skillfully weaves together the economic, political, psychological and social contexts of the time (1808-1880) to tell this fascinating history in an interpretive style. In essence, any student of history and the social sciences should get a copy of this book.

There is an emphasis on the 1996 season, as this was the Rangers' first ever playoff season, and the book brings back fond memories. Eric Nadel is the radio commentator for the Rangers, he does a great job with his broadcasts, and puts in terrific work with this book.I have been a Rangers fan since 1991, which much to my amazement, amounts to nearly 20 years. I was in school during the 1996 season, and though I no longer lived in Texas, I followed every Rangers move that I could. This was back before cable television offered baseball viewing packages, so I had to make due with only watching a few Rangers games each season, and listening to the rest by internet radio or other means. The 1996 season was a lot of fun and a real payoff for longtime fans.This book is broken up into sections, starting with the 1996 season, then going back to the beginning and moving forward chronologically with information on each season. Only when reading the full chronology does one develop a full appreciation at the futility that the Rangers went through before breaking through in 1996. The book closes with a section full of statistics for every Rangers player. It is an excellent \\"coffee table\\" reference book that you can pick up, read a portion, and then put back until you feel like looking something up or reading some more.It's been awhile since 1996, and I believe I read somewhere that Eric Nadel said he would consider doing an update to the book if the Rangers ever made the World Series.

If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","review":"I have a three year old daughter, and this book was a tremendous help in planning out trip to Disney World. It told us when and where to find the characters (a BIG item for planning the days), what rides to ride first, and most importantly, the information about FastPass. I highly recommend the book to anyone taking kids to DisneyWorld."},{"Title":"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","review":"We're gearing up toward a Disney World vacation late this August, and have relied on this book thoroughly. It isn't the most comprehensive book, but it offers lots of good advice. Good thing for any travelling family."},{"Title":"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","review":"As you see from most of the reviews of this book it is an excellent source of information. As the author notes, the level of enjoyment of your trip is directly related to the amount of research you do before your trip.In addition to being a great source of information before we left, it was a great read on the drive to Orlando. As parents, so much time is spent on the planning that the joyful anticipation of the trip is often left to the kids. The more we read and closer we got, the more excited we got.One personal caveat that is inferred in the book, but not stated expressly is that the Disney experience can be lost on young kids. Our six-year-old had an absolute blast, our 3 1/2-year-old was a bit tentative about the characters and some of the shows, but our two-year old was scared by the characters (I don't think he understood that they would be life-sized) and the shows created sensory overload. Several parents of young children we talked to said they would not repeat the experience with a child younger than four. We heartily second that."},{"Title":"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","review":"We used this for many months before our vacation last year. It was almost drenched with highlighter markings long before we left for Florida. When we got there, it was like our Bible as we toured the parks. It has everything you need to know for Disney and beyond. Her sense of humor is most amusing and she does let you know where to eat without losing your mind or cookies with toddler in tow. So buy it and then keep it, because you will write notes in it and after your trip it will become almost a souvenir of sorts with all your little articles and receipts etc, tucked away in side. You will look through it a year or two later and laugh at your comments about whatever you were thinking at the time. We had teenagers and toddler and everything worked out great, she has some real tips that do everyone good, not just the kids. Mom and dad won't lose their mind trying to please everyone. We are heading to Universal as well this year, so we will definitely be buying her Universal book."},{"Title":"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","review":"I found this book to be very out of date.

I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."},{"Title":"Walt Disney World with Kids, 2001 (Special-Interest Titles)","review":"We were looking for a book with information about the Disney Crusie Line with children. We are taking our daughters (9 and 13) on the Disney Wonder in February 2001, and we were looking for some insight that our travel agent couldn't give us. This book explained everything from check in at our Disney Resort to boarding the ship....it also explained all the activities available for our children and the dining schedules. I definately recommend this book to anyone who is looking for the same information that we were looking for!!

We especially enjoyed the spider making snow angels and the spider's relationship with the dog.My kindergartner has been reading for three months, and Mercer Mayer is her favorite author.

This book is my son's favorite. The story is about how Billy takes Blaze on a ranch vacation. They see a wild horse they name Thunderbolt. None of the grown up cowboys can get near him. Blaze and Thunderbolt become fast friends. Eventually Thunderbolt follows them home, jumps in the corral with Blaze, and becomes friends with Billy. Billy is the only person Thunderbolt trusts and eventually lets Billy train him. Billy goes home from vacation with a beautiful new horse and Blaze has a best friend. My son was facinated by the friendship between the horses and how a boy could train such a big animal. The illustrations are beautiful and my son loves them."},{"Title":"Blaze and Thunderbolt","review":"Fun books for their illustrations and not their writing quality, the Billy and Blaze series were always at the top of my list growing up. This book was my favorite; in it, Billy and his dependable ride Blaze find and slowly befriend Thunderbolt, a beautiful mustang running free in the wild west.Although poorly written, these books were fascinating to me as a girl and fed my imagination.

Bill who lives with Dede in name only is out to seek revenge on the Indians for his painful loss.

I always liked to read about American native people but even for me ( and I am living faraway from States) many things look untrue and strange. First, the picture on the front page - it looks that Thunder Heart has hair on his face. As I know Indians do not have to shave theirselves. Second, I think that such a worrier and chief as Thunder Heart was could not be involved with so many unimportant things, even if he is very,very,very in love. However, the most unusual character is Bill. I believe that such a man as Bill is, could not change so much.

Every paragraph brims with valuable references and insights.The book spans several hundred years of the literary and artistic traditions that made possible the formation of our modern faith.Ronald Hutton combines excellent scholarship with a truly sympathetic attitude toward modern earth religions. He rightly challenges the pagan community to grow away from dependence on pseudohistory. It's time we learned to be proud of our true roots, and turn this pride into a new movement of rich cultural development."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Anyone who's done even a small amount of research on Paganism, Wicca, or Witchcraft knows that Gerald Gardner took a very small amount of information and built on it to develope a brand new religion. Ronald Hutton shows where nearly every tiny detail of Gardner's information originated. From theories, ideals, principles, and facts he shows how Modern Witchcraft/Wicca came to be.He is a scholar and historian, rather than a Wiccan trying to prove the \\"authentic ancient heritage\\" of Wicca. He not only proves that Modern Witchcraft/Wicca is not ancient, he also proves that this lack of antiquity is completely irrelevent to the viability of Gardner's new religion.Anyone interested in Modern Witchcraft/Wicca or any form of neo-Paganism should read this book. He provides a list of sources and resources that an average person could barely make it through in a lifetime. Nearly anything you've ever seen in print regarding Modern Witchcraft/Wicca can be proven or disproven through the sources and resources he sites. Truly an amazing resource for any serious Witch/Wiccan or Pagan."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Excellent overview of the history of Paganism.

I am so glad this book is out there and hope that it finds its way into the syllabus of some of the Christian colleges. I know....but we can hope, right?"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Answer: What would you like it to be changed into?This is a sympathetic book towards neo-pagans. Ironically, because Hutton does not buy the party line of a pre-historic, nature religion whose tecahings have survived in an unbroken line through family clans, it's not popular with advocates of the matriarchal apostolic succession. In other words, pop Wicca 101 writers hate his guts.A Wicca, in case you haven't got a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary handy is a 'male witch' ( as contrasted with Wicce, a female )However if you've changed your name to Snowflake, Blackjack-for-my-Tribe, or some other Native American or Celtic ..., it's re-defined as someone who practises the 'Craft of the Wise', and to Hades with linguistic analysis. Who do these scholars think they are, anyway?Native American names are popular, since they had a splendid history of women's rights. Celtic ones are also cool, since the Druids were an all male priesthood who, like the Aztecs, practised human sacrifice , but c'mon, those redheaded Irish babes were hot!All Praise to Brigid!Wiccans or Witches are NOT--as they never tire of pointing out to the public--Satanists.Which of course makes absolutely no difference to the majority of Jews, Christians or Muslims, let alone fundamentalist ones; but I imagine it must be a source of great relief to Satanists, who consider Wiccans fluffy, neo-pagans, with atrocious taste in poetry. Hate to to say it, but they've got a point.\\"The Charge of the Goddess\\", for example, is a watered down ... of Crowley's Egyptian hymn to Nuit. Hutton suggests Wiccans would be better of with the lunar poetry of Shelley, Keats, Graves and other romantics.I hope I'm not making it sound like Hutton is ridiculing anyone;s religion. He's not. He's an old school Brit and goes out of his way to be cordial. It's just that the man IS a historian, so faced with some of the more bizarre claims of 'Traditional Wiccans' his polite response may sound to some hard core believers as if he's punching out the Tooth Fairy in front of a kindergarten class.For example, take the question of how a pagan polytheistic religion, whether invented or re-discovered in England by the likes of Gardner, Sanders, Dion Fortune and company--who were politically somehere to the monarchical right of Attila The Hun, cross over to the USA and become an evangelical, feminist, ecolological and de facto monotheistic (THE Goddess )religion?It's a fascinating historical tour de force by Hutton, a mystery story that weaves the threads of archeology from Sir Arthur Evans in Crete to Mariaja Gimbutas in Anatolia; combining the longings of 19th century Romantic writers--Charlotte Bronte included--to the celebration of Yule and other worldwide nature rites, to the \\"Burning Times\\"--a wildly revitionist view of the witch trials in medeival Europe--courtesy of Gardner, to the ancient worship of goddesses from Egpypt to Europe who were far more likely to be associated with motherhood, or war, than with rollicking about in the forest, invoking the moon.Perhaps the best defense for a belief in a worlwide Lady and Lord of the Woods pre-historical religion ( where did I put my VHS of 'The Wicker Man'?) comes from the craving of the soul. In a short story by Lovecraft, whose name I can't remember, a man brings an ancient vase to an archeologist who informs him that it's a fraud---no more than a hundred years old. The man counters by telling him that it's even more recent--he painted it himself last night, but the image came to him in a dream, and dreams are older than mankind. Hutton borders on the same point.As Robert Graves observed, though nominally The West is Christian, in actuality, most of us live as if we were ruled by what he called the 'unholy trimverate' of Pluto, god of wealth, Apollo, god of science and Mercury, god of thieves.May The Goddess protect you from having to sell used cars for a living. . ."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"....if you are truely interested in witchcraft. It tears apart the myths of wicca. This book is not for those who want to bask in a romantic vision of coven witchcraft nor for those who would have it that solitairy witches are the true inheritors of age old pagan practices.What it does leave intact is a history about humans who tried to break free from religious and social doctrine. Humans that created an inspired practice of modern pagan philosophy and practice. It is also a study into the dynamics of religious emancipation with all it's - apparently unavoidable - hiccups.I loved this book. It's managed to combine a critical look at the faulty wiccan construction of it's own history with a respectful and sympathetic handling of wiccan spirituality."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"The print in the paperback edition is agonizingly small. Try and find a hardcover copy if you like your eyesight. Maybe it's just me, but I've read a lot of books, and for this one I literally had to refocus my eyes to pick it up and put it down."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I have been a member of the pagan community for over 10 years, and I feel that Hutton has a better grasp of modern paganism than many neo-pagans and wiccans do! I wish pagan writers would do the kind of in-depth research that was done to produce this book.It is the first true history of Wicca that has ever been done...until now all we've gotten were the ridiculous myths and old sacred cows which should have been put down years ago. Here is our history told as it was, not as we might wish it to be, and I for one appreciate the factual account. Hutton is extremely sensitive and sympathetic (even supportive) of wicca as a valid relgion - and he is respectful to all of our founding fathers and mothers. He has obviously given great care to his research and respect to the pagans he contacted. I am astounded at how much he genuinely seems to like our religion and our people.Every pagan should own this book, and every trad leader and hp should have this on their required reading list."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I liked the book in many ways, but I was disappointed in his logic in the chapter about Ceremonial Magic and the Golden Dawn. One of the main thrusts of his book seemed to be that British Wicca was first deconstruction of the magic/religion dictotomy....and that this didn't happen with the Golden Dawn because it was a &quot;magical&quot; organization as opposed to a &quot;religious&quot; one. Albeit it was a different kind of magic...more theurgy as opposed to thamaturgy, but still not &quot;religious.&quot;I ended up more in conflict with Hutton on this, but I found the other aspects of the books more rewarding. The other part of Hutton I appreciated was his discussion of why research in this field is so difficult---that the closer you get to the present and away from Medieval and Renaissance magic and witchcraft, the tougher it is to function without access to private libraries.There are some practitioners who would disagree with his views on topics such has pagan notions of &quot;sacrifice&quot;- but the jury is still out on many of these issues, and there is still no clear consensus between practitioners and scholars on how to map many common religious notions, such as &quot;sacrifice&quot; onto Wicca."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is fluff-free and academically, though not poorly, written."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"The world still awaits a truly comprehensive history of Neopaganism. Margo Adler's estimable DRAWING DOWN THE MOON is perhaps the closest approach to date. With THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON, British historian Ronald Hutton has raised the bar for future efforts both in terms of depth of research and genuine insight. Though his book focuses on the antecedents and development of British Wicca, it contains a wealth of material to any reader interested in Neopaganism.Hutton is something of a bte noire for many Wiccans and other Neopagans after his iconoclastic PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES, particularly for his corrosive attacks on Robert Graves and THE WHITE GODDESS (however deserved they may have been). Hutton's work is, nevertheless, grounded in substantial research (as befits a widely-published historian) and a generally non-judgmental tone. Hutton continues his no-stone-unturned approach in this new book, but departs from simple history to offer rationales for the viability of Neopaganism as a religious path, even given its apparent twentieth-century origins.For many Neopagans outside of traditionalist Wicca, the book's focus on Neopagan Witchcraft (and in particular on Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders) may render its iconoclasm old news. Hutton's research only buttresses the deconstruction of Wicca begun in the '70s. Hutton's gift, though, is to go beyond the first order deconstruction and find unexpected bits of information amidst an impressive array of personal papers and museum holdings. For example, most informed readers will already be aware that &quot;Old&quot; Dorothy Clutterbuck, Gardner's supposed initiatrix, was shown to be a real person, after years of argument to the contrary. Hutton demonstrates, however--and rather conclusively to my mind--that &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; could not have been the person who initiated Gardner and he points emphatically to another woman who may have been hiding behind a smokescreen of Gardner's creation. Similarly, Hutton is not afraid to take on the now-taken-for-granted notion advanced by Aidan Kelly that the ritual nudity and scourging involved in Gardnerian Wicca were simply manifestations of Gardner's personal sexual kinks. Hutton ransacks Gardner's personal collection of pornography to refute this--and offers suggestions as to the real roots of these practices.The book is of greatest interest to the general (read, &quot;non-Wiccan&quot;) Neopagan reader in two regards. First, Hutton clearly demonstrates that the cultural roots of the Pagan revival lie embedded in the Romantic movement, particularly in Romantic Era poetry. The real forebears of the movement are seen to be, not Leland or Crowley (though both are examined and acknowledged), but poets like Keats, Shelley and Swinburne, who first identified the feminine divine with Nature and who repopularized the use of classical Pagan deities like Diana and Pan, often against critical resistance. The way in which Hutton tracks the passage of these motifs from literature into religion is fascinating.Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON represents a scholarly book by an apparently non-Pagan historian (unlike Adler) who is willing to see past the herd of sacred cows he is slaughtering to point out the transcendent values of Neopaganism--Wiccan or otherwise. He is careful throughout the book never to reach categorical judgements against some deeply-held beliefs, even where the evidence might strongly point in that direction. And, in the final pages of the book, Hutton sets aside the persona of the dispassionate researcher to advocate for pagan witchcraft as &quot;a full-blown, independent religion,&quot; one &quot;which deliberately draws upon ancient images and ideas for comtemporary needs,&quot; a protean faith which &quot;takes ideas from many sources and applies them in many--and often constantly altering--ways.&quot; Hutton hinted at this favorable sentiment in PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES and it is to his credit that he is willing to expand upon it here.Even speaking as an initiate in one of the traditions critically examined in the book (&quot;1734&quot; Witchcraft), I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Hutton has written a book that truly needed to be written, unlike the vast majority of texts on the history of modern pagan witchcraft, for and against. In essence, Hutton isn't for or against; he's an historian. This approach may well annoy those looking for support for their beliefs, of course, but for those interested in a dispassionate account, this is the book to buy.Hutton really starts with the eighteenth century, with Masonry, \\"cunning men\\", and other magic-workers of various kinds. He discusses these folks as sources for the later witchcraft revival, and gives his sources scrupulously. He then moves on to the nineteenth-century \\"occult revival\\", which is only rather sketchily handled, and to Gardner and the whole complex from which he arose.Next, Hutton discusses Gardner in considerable detail, considering the whole \\"Dorothy Clutterbuck\\" problem and the whole complex of the first Wiccan covens. It seems not unlikely that this discussion will infuriate those who don't want to think of Gardner as a spiritual ancestor for their modern practices. At the same time, it's likely to tick off those would-be \\"debunkers\\" who want a lurid account of Gardner the evil sex-maniac. Overall, I found that Gardner came off rather sympathetically, which surprised me.For me, the best thing about the book is the discussion of the extension of Wicca past Gardner's own influence. For example, I tend to associate the rise of Neopaganism with liberal politics, given the strong affiliations with the rise of feminism, ecological activism, and a kind of back-to-the-earth approach to collapsing the modern military-industrial dominance of (especially) American economics and politics. But Hutton demonstrates that in the first half of the century, in England, Wicca was very much a right-wing movement, not entirely divorced from movements like Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and the Kibbo Kift. The transition from right to left, concurrent with the switch from one side of the Atlantic to the other, is fascinating, and deftly handled by Hutton.I suppose the book is somewhat dense, if you're not used to mildly academic prose, but by academic standards it's pretty breezy reading. The book is quite accessible, as it is carefully indexed and Hutton makes clear what he's doing and why. If you are interested in a fairly direct, straightforward history of Neopagan witchcraft, this is a great book.You will hate this book if:1) You are absolutely certain that Wicca is a surviving ancient pagan religion, continuing underground despite centuries of oppression; or2) You are absolutely certain that Wicca is a load of nonsense, made up by some foolish sex-crazed women, which offers no spiritual rewards to anyone with half a brain.You will love this book if:1) You are willing to read some rather dense, careful historical prose, in a mildly academic style; and2) You would genuinely like to know a good deal about the ins and outs of the origins of the modern pagan witchcraft revival, and how it has developed over the last century."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Hutton, for those who haven't read his work, is a British historian whose previous major work has been several works on Charles II through the Glorious Revolution; as well as The pagan religions of the ancient British Isles (about the documentable religions and religious practices of pre-Christian Britain), The rise and fall of merry England: the ritual year, 1400-1700 (a history of festivals and holidays in Britain), and Stations of the Sun (the ritual year in Britain and its history). Essentially the latter two look at the same overall field of evidence from two different angles, triangulating on the fact that the most ancient festivals and holidays that are claimed to stretch back to the ancient pagan past, can (virtually) all be documented to have developed in the late medieval and post-medieval world.If you can't see the pattern here, his interest seems to have been trying to back-track elements of modern pagan tradition and mythology. It should be noted that at no time does he ever stray from his essential (and frequently stated) premise - that modern paganism is a perfectly valid modern religious format.It is from this foundation that he finally takes the leap in his Triumph of the Moon, wherein he examines the history of modern paganism and places it into its place in a larger counter-cultural tradition stretching back at least to the Romantic period (if you've seen his article on the Great Neolithic Goddess Cult that appeared in Antiquity several years ago, you may have some idea of where the path this has taken). He discusses what he sees as the essential elements of Language (what do we mean by &quot;paganism&quot;), Goddess, God, Stucture (basically Freemasonic), High Magic, Low Magic, Folklore (Golden Bough and Frazer's followers), Witchcraft (such as Murray and Leland), and the Matrix of post-Victorian England in which all of these &quot;Macrocosmic&quot; elements were brought together and influenced by the works of Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune and Robert Graves. His short biographies of these three range from the balanced and thoughtful (Crowley) to the somewhat more aggressive (Graves).From this birthplace, he examines the history of Gardner and his genealogy, re-examining the same old information with the perspective of (at least what looks like) objectivity - noting the different emergent groups that appear (and rather than simply assuming that they are &quot;Gardnerian offshoots&quot; noting the influences when they are there, but also examining their individual histories). He also notes and describes the earlier scholarly works that have preceded him into this field, from Aiden Kelly and Margot Adler to Tanya Luhrmann and others -- as well as their influences and the influences of their material on neo-Paganism as a whole.His conclusion presents a snapshot of pagan witchcraft at the end of the 20th century in Britain. I make that specific, since covens are still a little more the norm in Britain than they are here in the US. Very nice work, all in all. He does not, in my opinion, lose his objectivity for the most part - and when he does it's to lean more towards the feelings of the people he's studied. For example, his treatment of the Neolithic Mother Goddess, in this work, while clearly showing the implausibility, does not exclude its possibility.In short, if you are truly interested in the history of neo-Paganism, read it. It's worth it - you may not always agree with him (I know I don't), but he will give you a fresh perspective."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It will give you all the details on how Wicca came to be created in the mid-twentieth century, based on literary, artistic, and academic fashions, the practices of fraternal orders and occult societies, old and new folk customs, and other cultural roots (real and imagined) going back to the 1700s. Hutton leaves no hope for those who wish to believe in a constantly existing Pagan religion in Britain or in a connection between the early modern witch trials and Paganism. No one can claim to be knowledgeable about the true history of modern Witchcraft who has not read and carefully studied this text.This meticulously documented book pounds the final nails into the coffin of the claims Gardner made (and others inflated) that Wicca was an ancient surviving British Pagan religion of Witchcraft. None but the most stubbornly fundamentalist of Orthodox Wiccans can deny it any longer, though they have continued to try.Hutton's work supports and amplifies the research into Wiccan history that I and other modern writers have done over the last thirty years. Indeed, the chapters in my book Bonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca on Gerald Gardner and the birth of Wicca owe a great deal to his clear exposition of complex details.Every Wiccan should have this book on their shelves.A PS for 2006: Many of the complaints by other reviewers here seem to me to be attempts to substitute unverified (and deliberately unverifiable) claims by modern Pagan authors to \\"secret evidence\\" they supposedly have access to that Hutton did not. Others are attempts to use misdirection by saying that Classical religions had (and Classical writers mentioned) goddesses similar to what modern Wicca has and \\"therefore\\" Wicca is ancient. No, because Gerald Gardner studied those ancient religions and read many of those Classical authors. Just using bits and pieces of something old in your invention doesn't constitute \\"proof\\" that your invention is itself old. Gardner was a brilliant creative artist who started something wonderful. Let's give him the credit he deserves and stop trying to shoot the messengers who have revealed his creative efforts. As for Hutton, I know him personally, and I know that he is far from being a \\"hostile enemy\\" to Wicca, being instead a sympathetic yet honest scholar. The Neopagan movement needs more authors like Hutton, not fewer."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Finally, a historian has written a book that details the origins of modern Witchcraft and Wicca. And said historian actually did a great deal of research and backs up his thesis with factual, primary source material, as opposed to the usual fantastical wish-fulfillment claptrap that many Neo-Pagan authors use to support thier pet theories regarding the history of Witchcraft.Some people will be disappointed in this book, no doubt, for nowhere does Hutton mention an unbroken lineage of Witches that stretches beyond the burning times far into the dim reaches of matriarchal prehistory where all the women were strong, the men were beautiful, and the children were peaceful and never hit each other over the head with rocks whilst playing oppressive, competitive male-oriented team sports.What this book does detail is a plausible explaination as to -why- modern Witchcraft would arise at all, and how it fits into post industrial society. I cannot praise the fact that Hutton doesn't only delve into the history of Witchcraft, but he shows us why it is important in the first place, and what it has to say about society as a whole, and Neo-Pagans in specific.The book is well-written, if densely packed with information. It is not an easy read; if one skims, one is apt to miss essential details and lose sight of the myriad threads that Hutton traces in his search for the warp and weft of Witchcraft today. I took my time reading this book, savoring it with rhapsodic glee: it was good to find that there was an academic who had actually taken the time to prove some of my own pet theories about Witchcraft in England during the modern period.At any rate, this book belongs on the shelf of every literate and educated Witch, Wiccan and Neo-Pagan in the world. If we Witches ever got around to opening up schools, I believe this should be a standard history text for any class that includes the study of our religious beliefs. It is always important to know where one comes from, in order to better decide where one would like to go."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"The Pagan community has needed a book like this for two generations now -- scholarly, erudite, respectful, and documented well enough to meet academic standards rather than the standards of the popular press.A friend of mine bought it for me from the UK a few months before it came out in the States, and I haven't put it down. I haven't chased down footnotes with such vigor since I got out of graduate school.My only regret is that this book is an academic's research -- written for other academics. It's hardly dry for academic historians and folklorists, but I wonder how accessible it is to the lay audience, who need it most."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Wow, do I know I lot of people who need to read this!Someone, and a respected historian-someone at that, has finally done it - and I only hope that there is more to come!I came across this book in a university course and I can only say that I am deeply grateful to know that something like it has finally been written. Why didn't anyone mention it to me before huh? - I thought this was bound to be a standard work on every Wiccan's, Witch's or Pagan's bookshelf, right next to Margot Adler's \\"Drawing Down The Moon\\"!Hutton's book is an in-depth study of the backgrounds, origins and development of modern Pagan witchcraft. Although it mainly focuses on Britain and on Wicca, it certainly provides a lot of \\"where-from\\" information on Neo-Paganism in general as well.The first part of the book - \\"Macrocosm\\" - is a thorough study of the larger context, which in 1800-1940 Britain made it possible that something like Wicca could evolve. It deals with Romantic literature, archaeology, the 'cunning folk' and popular 'low magic', European learned 'high magic', folklore, secret societies, Theosophy, the Order of the Golden Dawn and Freemasonry etc. etc.The second part - \\"Microcosm\\" - deals with the actual development of Wiccan traditions as they are practised today, starting with Gerald Gardner, then moving on to other important figures (such as Doreen Valiente etc.) and describing the development of other Wiccan traditions and also assumedly-independent-from-Wicca witchcraft traditions. Hutton also acknowledges the importance of the USA and how Wicca was greatly changed by the left-wing feminist attitude of American practitioners.Although not written academically dry it is certainly no light read, just because of the sheer mass of information it includes, but it will be worth the effort, trust me.Seldom have I read a book so packed full of things that I have always wanted to know and wondered about. I even know my share about Freemasonry now ;). The enormous research behind it and excessive end-notes satisfy even my sceptical mind. Hey, finally someone tries to PROVE what they are saying! It is therefore also a great sourcebook and basic work for further studies of your own.However, for those who firmly believe in an unbroken continuity of Wicca from before the burning times, it is certainly a challenge, because Hutton does away with this theory most thoroughly. - But he does so in a very kind way, showing that there really is no need to justify a perfectly acceptable modern religion by means of these \\"ancient roots\\", and that, even if modern Pagans do pick and choose from actual older sources&religions;, they are creating something uniquely modern, but nonetheless perfectly valid in the process.The only two drawbacks are the tiny tiny tiny printing in the paperback, which has me longing for the hardcover edition - hopefully printed larger so that I can read it again and again without needing a magnifying glass or ruining my eyes.The other is that for someone completely new to the subject it is probably sometimes hard to understand what it is all about, especially since Hutton includes so much detailed information.If you've never heard of modern witchcraft, Wicca or Paganism, read \\"Drawing Down The Moon\\" first - then you can truly enjoy \\"The Triumph Of The Moon\\"."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Hutton has performed an outstanding service to scholarship with this study. Avoiding politics and polemics, he provides the historical roots of a phenomenon clearly of recent invention. Pagan, Druidic and Wiccan organizations dwell on their roots from a distant past. Hutton shows their origins are in more modern literature and structured on organizations such as the Freemasons. There are, he emphasizes without rancour, no truly verifiable ancient origins for modern witchcraft. Although some readers may be deterred by the scholarly tone of this work, it is precisely Hutton's detached view of these social phenomena that has been lacking. He has filled a long-vacant niche and done it gracefully. More importantly, he's given us a valuable history that will endure.The underlying theme is clear - the claims of modern pagans, \\"wiccans\\" and other occult groups to clear roots deep in prehistoric times is invalid. Hutton's research reveals the creation of various gods and goddesses arose from 18th Century literature. None of the Enlightenment or Romantic era writers used valid sources to claims that Pan, Diana or other \\"natural\\" deities persisted into modern times. All of the themes of \\"earth\\" or \\"cosmic\\" religions resulted from some disaffection - usually, but not always, with rigid Christianity. These literary creations found a ready readership, usually among intellectuals, later with a wider public, disillusioned in no small part by the social disruptions of industrialising Britain. A \\"return to nature\\" and its fabricated deities was an alluring solution to perceived woes. The pivotal event in translating this literary background for modern audiences, of course, was the publication of James Frazer's \\"The Golden Bough\\". Given the paucity of substance in that book, it's astonishing to learn it remains in print.As Hutton leads us through the groves of literary invention, he frequently points out the brambles encountered. It's easy to become ensnared by enthusiasm replacing scholarship. Phrases like \\"without sources\\", \\"no research\\" and \\"leaping beyond evidence\\" occur with depressing frequency. Yet note the lack of \\"fabricated\\", \\"contrived\\", or \\"invented\\". Hutton is at pains to show that however ephemeral the origins, these writers, and their avid readers, firmly believe in what they say. What they believe in appears to vary with each individual, but that seems to be the nature of religions, ancient or modern, according to Hutton. Pan, for example, is mischievous, diabolical, sexually rampant or idyllic in turn as successive writers portrayed him over the decades.The research underlying this study is staggering. Over fifty pages of annotated bibliography plus numerous interviews and personal correspondence support this work. He even manages to work in The X-Files and Terry Pratchett's Discworld series! Hutton's crowded reading schedule offers a hedgehog of pointers for the interested, but the book must be read closely to determine which are worth following. Some sources are more noteworthy than others, of course. If modern Paganism can be said to have a \\"founder\\" it is in the figure of Gerald Gardner. His writings, most of which fall into Hutton's scanty resource base category, initiated the wave of pagan witchcraft active in Britain and America today. Hutton shows how, despite schisms and divergences, Gardner's idea crossed the Atlantic to find ready acceptance in North America. There, merged with radical feminism, it not only took root, but rebounded across the sea to reinvigorate the British pagan movement. However, lack of cohesion leads Hutton to view it as having a \\"luxuriant complexity\\".Hutton is at pains to avoid blemishing his study with \\"reactivity\\" or \\"reflexivity\\". The former, he explains, is influencing the beliefs or behaviour of those under study. \\"Reflexivity\\" is what the historian undergoes when examining his own motives and reactions to the information acquired. He steadfastly rejects the second while striving to minimize the first. It's a difficult balance, but he has achieved both successfully. The only real shortcoming in this book are the typos - jarring in a work published by an academic press. One might like some illustrative material to break the monotony of text. He also fails to list any Web sources. Even with the vaporous nature of Internet sites, some of the organizations he cites can be found. None of these limitations fail to intrude on a worthwhile and important study of an overlooked phenomenon. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Ronald Hutton's Triumph Of The Moon is an excellent historical study and exploratory overview of Wicca. Since its history is an extremely volatile and complex subject, in his preface Hutton is wisely modest about the present limits of the information available to scholars and the scope of his abilities and intentions-no promises to absolute knowledge are made. Hutton clearly realizes that his subject is a matter of belief and faith to Wicca's adherents, and therefore his careful conclusions are largely relative and theoretical. His writing style is plain-spoken and academic, his approach studiously matter-of-fact throughout.Since he is a historian and not a psychologist, Hutton steers away from any investigation of the archetypal witch image as a apparent constant of the human psyche and condition, focusing instead on whatever traceable elements of a genuine \`witch tradition' and survival existed and exist in fact. Considering that witches appear both everywhere and nowhere throughout history, Hutton pulls off a remarkable piece of speculative detective work. He remains uncommonly fair and open-minded throughout, considering all claims equally and going so far as to express that he does not deny the possibility that the gods and goddesses of Wicca-including Pan--exist objectively. If this is a simple placating measure, Hutton handles it with aplomb.The author states that the most important argument of his book is that Wicca is the result of a combination of cultural forces and undertones that have developed in England since 1800, including the Murray thesis as a erroneous theory and modern myth rather than as a hypothesis having any basis in fact.But it's not difficult to believe that some remnant of pre-Christian religions existed in dynamic form during the Middle Ages, continued to be practiced and came to be identified as witchcraft by the dominant Christian establishment. This proposed pagan religion-presumably some form of nature worship-may have not been a focused, formalized religion in fact, but something more akin to Ireland's \`fairy faith'-a powerful belief system that took a wide variety of forms in diverse parts of Europe.Since veneration of different aspects of nature as a means of insuring a bountiful harvest seems to be a fairly common and probably spontaneous phenomena among man when in the early stages of development, why should some trace of this not have continued into the Middle Ages among agrarian people? Murray may have been all wrong in her both carefully and carelessly built-up specifics, but at least partially correct generally. Though Carlo Ginzburg was apparently unclear about how or if to link his discovery of the benandanti in the Fruili region to Murray's thesis, the example Hutton gives of the century-old witch community on the Welsh island of Mon is fairly impressive, especially since he is able to identify at least three other \`pagan witch traditions' older than and apparently independent of Gardnerian Wicca.Among those who helped produce \`the pool of ideas and impulses' which led or may have contributed to the formation of Wicca are key figures James Frazer, James Michelet, Margaret Murray, Charles Godfrey Leland, Samuel Liddell Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Gerald Gardner, and Dion Fortune, each of whose work Hutton carefully considers.Hutton clearly loves his subject; the reader senses that no one would secretly enjoy discovering solid proof of a pagan survival of this kind more than he. His sympathy, however, never compromises his rigorous scholarly standards. This is a cautious, well-considered and erudite book that should educate most and offend few."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"As several people have already said here, the incomparable Ronald Hutton has done the Pagan community an immense service with _Triumph of the Moon_. Indeed, he achieves the near-impossible: he has produced an academic monograph on the origins of modern Pagan witchcraft capable of satisfying those on the inside (Pagans) _and_ those on the outside (academics and society at large).Hutton brings his characteristic wit and penetrating insight to bear upon the 'history' of modern witchcraft, and the result is simultaneously a sobering and an uplifting read. This is no mere hatchet job on the always-shaky historical claims of Gardner _et al_; it is a wide-ranging and extremely intelligent study of social, intellectual and spiritual trends in Britain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which places the modern Craft in its worldly context. A succession of poets, academics, cunning folk, anthropologists, Masons and occultists are discussed, illuminating social currents of the day, and exploring the contribution of each to the great mosaic that became the modern Craft.The myths, too, are explored: Margaret Murray, 'the burning times', Gardner's Book of Shadows and the myth of prehistoric 'Great Goddess' are all carefully examined, and gently (or not so gently) punctured. Yet I cannot emphasise enough that this is not an attack on Paganism - that it can only, in fact, make it stronger. The first (Gardnerian) witches' claims to the antiquity of their tradition may have been spurious, but Hutton makes it clear that this removes nothing from the fact that there was 'something in the water', so to speak, of early twentieth century society. Far from appearing a deceitful aberration, Gardner and others are shown to be expressive of a mood of their times, taking the logical next step in giving Paganism a structure and greater definition.Two caveats (because I feel I ought to...): 1) The focus - both in historial chapters and in the sociological case study at the end - is upon coven witchcraft, with little space for solitary workers (although this is perfectly reasonable in terms of what Hutton is trying to); 2) From an article in 'Pagan Dawn' a little while back, I gather that Hutton's research is ongoing, and there's a possibility of a second edition at some point in the future!Hutton is an engaging and lucid writer, as adept at discussing long-term social trends as he is at providing lively pen-portraits of the various writers and witches who parade through his pages. An enjoyable and an enlightening read for anyone with an interest in the Craft or in 20th century social history. Wonderful."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"...is that there is much less to it than meets the eye. This book is a brilliant scholarly study by a fine professional historian. This is important because much of the attraction of witchcraft or paganism, both to its adherents and to the wider society as a whole is that it appeals to deep intutions and fears about history and the past. Whatever happened to the pre-Christian religions of Europe? Are there people who consciously worship the Devil? Is there a continuous history of pagan religion that has lasted to the present day? What were the deep roots behind the savagery of the witch trials?It is one of the invaluable merits of this book that Hutton answers these questions, which are, respectively, it died out, no, no, and not misogyny. Hutton shows considerable sympathy to the modern witches and pagans. Without them, after all he would not have been able to write this book. Yet Hutton is quite thorough that their main belief, that they are reviving a pre-Christian past that in some way or another is superior to Christianity and to our modern society, is false. \\"...the unique significance of pagan witchcraft to history is that it is the only religion which England has ever given the world.\\"Some historical context is needed, and Hutton provides it throughout the book. In the 1920s Margaret Murray came out with the thesis that the witchcraft trials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were actually directed against a real religion, an organized Pagan religion which was the common religion of Europe that underlay a superficial Christianity. Associated with this view and slowly developing later was that the witchcraft trials were savagely misogynist attacks against women. This view has been the backbone of pagan propaganda for decades and it is only now changing because it is increasingly clear that it is untrue in every major respect. To argue that there were really witch ceremonies, Murray deliberately excluded all the supernatural elements in the trial testimony, making it look more sober and rational (and non-coerced by torture) than it really was. Contrary to myth, 9 million women were not burned, but only 50,000 people in total. A majority were women (though in some areas of Europe most were men), but contrary to myth, midwives were not specifically singled out (indeed they helped to look for suspects), and many of the poor isolated people accused were themselves denounced by women. The idea that people were only superficially Christian is clearly inaccurate as scholars such as Christopher Haigh and Eamon Duffy have shown the strength of Roman Catholicism before the Reformation and its hegemony (scholars have also shown that the oral-literate distinction has been much overstated in modern England.) Hutton is quite good on how folklorists saw customs that clearly developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be pagan revivials. He points out how the distinguished archaeologist of the Baltic, Marija Gimbutas, became so obsessed with the idea of a Pan-European Goddess religion that she ignored that the supposedly \\"Goddess\\" English superhenges were actually a thousand years later than the supposedly \\"patriarchal\\" Irish Linkardsdtown cists that supposedly replaced them.But Hutton is more than a debunker. The first half of the book goes into detail about the wider cultural influences that encouraged a revival of Paganism in 19th and 20th century Britain. He discusses as part of the decline of Anglicanism how even rather stalwart figures like Kipling and H. Rider Haggard looked to something more exotic. He discusses the enthusiasm for Pan and the belief in a primoridal Goddess. There is a very useful chapter on the origins of freemasonry, which should be read by all those who believe the myth that Jack the Ripper was somehow involved with the Prince of Wales. He also provides a chapter on cunning magic and low magic (were cunning men and white magic representatives of a pagan religion. Short answer: No. In fact they were just as religious (or no more religious)as the wider society.This covers the first half of the book, and the second half covers the second half as an actual neo-pagan religion developed. Although many witches and pagans today emphasize their feminism and environmentalism, leading pagans like Aleister Crowley and Gerald Gardner were actually tories. (The one truly unforgiveable thing about Crowley in fact was his anti-semitism.) Although Hutton shows commendable patience and tolerance with his informants he does show that there is no evidence of a continous pagan religion. Indeed, there is little reliable evidence that any witches can date back their practices before the second world war. Gibbon once wickedly commented that one reason that Romans believed that Christians were guilty of preposterous crimes like incest and cannibalism was because Christian sects so often flung such accusations at each other. Hutton notes the same problems about modern witches, though he clearly points out that there is no evidence they were guilty of anything (promiscuity isn't even mandatory!) criminal. He is also properly sympathetic to those who were foully libelled and their lives damaged by irresponsible and malicious press campaigns.One interesting point that Hutton does not fully emphasize is that both the interest in paganism and the paranoid fear of Satanism is both the product of the decline of Christianity. After all, before the Enlightenment Christians did not fear an organized conspiracy of Satanists. Either they feared other Christians (Protestants vs. Catholic vs. Orthodox) or they feared Islam. More could be said also about neo-paganism and the one really existing pre-Christian religion, Judaism. But otherwise this is a fascinating book and in the end Hutton points out that modern witchcraft is not a sect or a cult or a New Age Movement or a nature religion. Personally, I think we would all be better off reading Adorno."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton ...When I picked up Hutton, the rather dry introduction was almost enough to turn me off. The man is not a Wiccan writer -- he is a historian... and the intro had all the \\"dryness\\" associated with that subject.Once I began on the text, however, I was truly impressed. I had expected a \\"history of the movement\\" similar to Drawing Down the Moon (by Margot Adler). Instead, this was an examination of the roots of the movement, and the things that influenced those roots.It is both readable and well-documented. Hutton takes a historian's view -- starting not with Gardner, but with Byron -- following all the influences that led to the birth of the modern Wiccan religion. In the process, he sheds light on a number of \\"mysteries\\" that many people (myself included) had assumed would never really be solved.Not stopping with Gardner, he then follows the movement forward in time, introducing a number of prominent figures in the Wiccan world, and delving into their background, influences, and credibility, and showing how they fit into the \\"big picture\\". In the process, he examines how American Wicca has grown differently than British Wicca, and the cultural reasons for those differences.In addition to being well-written, the book is well-documented. Hutton never asserts something as fact without telling you his source. (Too many Pagan books forget this basic rule.) If you had the time, energy, & resources, you could duplicate his research with the information he gives.He uses the facts to blow up a lot of cherished Wiccan myths, but he does so with compassion. And in such a way that you realize the myths are not necessary to follow this path... and may even detract from it.I do not always agree with Hutton's conclusions about the material he presents. (He tends to err on the side of acceptance, where I'm a bit more hard-nosed.) And I hesitate to give any single source my full support. But until we have more work of this caliber, Triumph of the Moon should be on everyone's reading list... if only so that they get their facts straight."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"The Triumph of the Moon is the first full length and wide-ranging history of Wicca ever published. It is written by Dr. Ronald Hutton who is professor of history at the University of Bristol. Hutton has created the defining text on the subject--his research is wide and well documented and his theories tend to be fair and carefully argued. In addition to providing a great deal of information about the immediate events surrounding Gerald Gardner and others, Hutton provides the essential historical, social, and cultural context into which Wicca entered the world. This text requires some patience and time to read, as it is long and comprehensive, but it is required reading for anyone deeply interested in Wicca's history."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I just finished reading this excellent book and was disappointed to see several negative reviews-- just because the font size in the paperback is small.As much as Mr. Hutton deserves his royalties, I recommend that you get the hard back (it has reasonable sized font) from your library and read this well-written, fascinating book. You'll learn things about modern paganism and western culture that I don't think you'd find anywhere else.As there are nearly a hundred reviews here already, I'll keep my comments brief-- or at least briefer than they would be otherwise. Each chapter is devoted to one element that contributed to the rise of modern paganism including Greek literature, the invention of \\"ancient,\\" secret societies, local practitioners of spells and curses, poetry, literature (and trashy novels), scholarship, politics, and other elements. It could have been a dry, dull book of interest only to modern pagans. However, I had FUN reading it; how often can you say that about non-fiction?The author debunks a number of common ideas, so a modern pagan might (or might not) be disturbed by some of the information. (I myself was a bit disappointed in Robert Graves and Mary Daly.) However, I agree with the author's statement that none of his findings invalidate the religion. I think that his research reveals how much our culture longed for and perhaps needed modern paganism.The subject was interesting-- but for me, how the author approached the subject was even more interesting. First, he spent years researching. Second, he treated the people and ideas with an immense amount of respect; it shines through every word. Third, he was objective and fair; he seemed deeply interested in the truth. Even when he had gathered and presented significant evidence for one conclusion, he didn't omit other possible interpretations of the same facts. Fourth, his thinking and analysis of ideas is so clear; he's able to discern problems in cases where I'd never have seen them. I want to sit down with Mr. Hutton and discuss how he did his research and writing. What a scholar!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Hutton has thoroughly done his research. There is a lot of information that is going to make a lot of Wiccans (and many Pagans) reevaluate the whys and wherefores of their beliefs. As a Pagan/Wiccan, I find this to be a healthy thing. Hutton's research is definitely worth having in your library, even if it does challenge some notions many Wiccans have.In my opinion, this book is a must-have for anyone studying about Wicca."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book should be in every Wiccan's bookshelf, and in every student's first purchase box.That said, it isn't a Wiccan book.To put it bluntly, this is the book that serves as a sort of flashlight for any pagan research. Erroneous claims, fraudlent histories and silly ranting about who came first seems to dissolve like fog in the sun in its presence.Excellent for Wiccans and people wanting to understand them, perhaps not so good for those who capitalize on the frauds it exposes."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"So much information is within this book as to origins and influences on many modern-day Wiccan practices! I've recommended this book to many Wiccans and pagans, alike. I've given it to several priestesses, and plan to buy more copies for others in the future. The information is sometimes astonishing, and always well-researched. As a Wiccan of over 25 years, I think it's one of the best books on the subject of modern Wicca that I've seen. A must for historians, students, and followers of the Craft."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I have seen several negative reviews about this book, and that's ok. some people don't want to have their precious castles in the sky brought down to Earth. but for the rest of us, we have this wonderful book.I think the major advantage to this book is that it was written by a non-pagan. He cannot be accused of revisionism, nor can he be accused of choosing one form of Witchcraft over another. He is outside the &quot;Witch Wars&quot;, and that helps him greatly. He is a historian with nothing to gain or lose from debunking the &quot;wicca-is-as-old-as-man&quot; myth. finally!Hutton discusses a number of names in the history of the Craft, both big and small. Gardner, Sanders, Crowley, Valiente, Murray, Graves..none are immune from either Hutton's praise or question. I suspect that what most people find so good about this book is the sheer number of people the author has spoken to in addition to the number of texts he has read.Several people have accused Hutton of tunnel-vision. here is my reply. if your idea of history is some pseudo-scientific drivel, you're welcome to it! Graves rewrote the myth of Hekate, Gardner borrowed whatever he could from every source availible to him, Leland may have been wrong and mislead a la Mead, and Murray made up a lot of her statistics and revised a lot of history. what disturbs these reviewers isn't that Hutton is right or wrong, but that the &quot;Gospel of Gardner/Leland/Murray/Graves&quot; has been challenged.it is about time that someone stepped up to the plate and gave the world a book such as this. new doesn't equal bad, i don't know why some of these reviewers are all wound up. my only complaint about the book...Oxford Press: could you have made the print any smaller?!?"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Ronald Hutton is professor of history at University of Bristol, and quite possibly the foremost academic authority on Wicca--modern pagan witchcraft. His hypothesis is relatively straightforward: Wicca is the only religion England has ever given the world; it is not the same thing as witchcraft, but a modern synthesis of a great many historical events and intellectual currents.Throughout recorded history, one finds evidence of witchcraft and occult practices. But Wicca, properly so called, is the brainchild of Gerald Gardner. Gardner was an Englishman who spent much of his life as the owner of tea and rubber plantations in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), North Borneo, and Malaya, and who later worked as an inspector in the Malay customs service. In 1936, at age 52, Gardner retired to England. After a series of encounters with other occultists (including the notorious Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis, and someone whom Gardner calls \\"Old Dorothy\\"), and his own research and inquiries, Gardner published in 1949 a novel entitled \\"High Magic's Aid,\\" which he claimed contains beliefs and rituals of the alleged witches with whom he worked. In 1951, England repealed the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Act, allowing witches to practice more openly. And in 1954, Gardner brought out his second book, \\"Witchcraft Today,\\" in which he posed as a disinterested anthropologist lucky enough to have discovered surviving covens practicing a secret initiatory system of pagan religion, a religion that Gardner claimed stretched back into antiquity over millenia.But Professor Hutton demonstrates, to my satisfaction at least, that this isn't really what occurred. Instead, Hutton claims, Gerald Gardner drew on a wide disparity of sources and subject matters, and on his own and others' misinterpretations and misunderstandings of history, to synthesize his own version of what he believed witchcraft ought to be, a normative rather than empirical phenomenon. Gardnerian Wicca is therefore the product of Gerald Gardner's creative genius. Hutton also clarifies the relationships among the various descendants and step-children of Gardnerian Wicca.Professor Hutton tells this story with supreme craftsmanship and elan. A lesser analytical talent might be overwhelmed with the vast amount of source material; such an inferior author might also confuse the various strands, or fail to trace properly the various twists of the tale. Red herrings indeed abound in this story, but Professor Hutton does not fall for them, nor allow them to divert him from the book's main task. He skilfully weaves all the various threads together.At book's end, the careful reader has been enlightened, confusion dispelled, not increased. This reader, who has paid properly close attention to what Professor Hutton has to say, will find her understanding of Wicca and its origins greatly enhanced, and will not be so credulous when confronting Wiccan claims of its immense antiquity. Professor Hutton succeeds in the task he sets for himself. By taking us along in the journey, we have not only been vastly entertained, but enlightened. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"For decades scholars have been misdirected and sidetracked in their study of witchcraft due to an almost singular focus on the writings of Gerald Gardner, Gardnerian Wicca, and all that evolved from this singular core. Hutton's book is a primary example of this tunnel vision approach to the study of witchcraft as an ongoing religion.Gerald Gardner was simply one man living on a small island nation, who made certain claims about being involved with various groups and individuals alledged to belong to a religion he called Wicca. What he discovered (or as some people claim he invented) has little to do with witchcraft as a whole.Witchcraft existed long before Gardner and has continued on quite nicely without him and what he generated. One of the major failings of Hutton's book is that it treats Gardner and Gardnerian Wicca as being the history of modern witchcraft as a whole. It is not, it is instead simply the history of one thing that became public in England and was then carried to other regions of Europe and to the United States.Hutton's book, taken strictly as a history of Gardnerian Wicca and its offshoots, seems sound enough for what it is. I don't know for sure and it's really not all that important. I was simpy disappointed that this book claimed to be a history of modern pagan witchcraft when what it actually presents is an indepth look at the view of one man (Gardner) and the things that sprang from his writings on it. Perhaps the book should have been subtitled: A history of Modern Wicca from the time of Gerald Gardner."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Despite being horrifically overwritten, this book pays little attention to its subject.Most of the book is disparaging comments about what other authors have written on a variety of topics; the relevance to witchcraft is never explained. There is no thesis statement to aid us in attempting to connect the material on our own.Although he criticizes everyone else across a myriad of subjects, he never presents the corrected view. He would have done better to at least establish his hypothesis up front and tell us how each chapter contributes to proving it.The subtitle says this is a history. The only history it contains is brief discussions of Gardner, Sanders, feminist Wicca and the Craft's purported reluctance to acknowledge modern historians. He claims the latter agree few people were killed as witches during the Burning Times (he doesn't give a number) and that sabbats mentioned during those trials were wholly fictitious (he doesn't explain why one would ignore the trial testimony to reach this conclusion).Of Gardner's greatest controversy (did he inherit or invent), the author draws no conclusion.Unacknowledged by the subtitle is the limitation of the work to British witchcraft except for a foray into how American feminist Wicca influenced British Craft.It's as if Schlesinger's \\"A Thousand Days\\" mentioned JFK's birth, talked about his performance in first grade, discussed his sisters and spent the rest of the time disparaging other books about presidents from McKinley on up and bootleggers. Would anyone call that history?Hutton's definition of \\"close acquaintance\\" (his words) with various covens includes those he visited *once*. His experience was exclusively with witches in covens which, I suspect, were the minority of witches even at the time the author was working.This is hardly \\"a history of modern pagan witchcraft\\" which the subtitle claims.As the author writes (bashing yet another predecessor), \\"The quantity of actual ... historical information contained here is minimal ... \\" (Kindle location 4883-86), a judgment which aptly describes his own work in the present book."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I found this book to be of some interest as a perspective on modern Wicca/Witchcraft. However, I felt somewhat embarassed for the author in his desperate attempt to help scholars recover from their former skepticism regarding Gerald Gardner's claims about Dorothy Clutterbuck. The academic community had long held that Gardner invented this character, but Doreen Valiente went on to prove Clutterbuck's actual existence. Hutton, while now accepting the truth of Clutterbuck's existence, moves forward with a tunnel vision approach intended to prove that even though she turned out to be a real person, she was probably not a witch!. This reminds us of another scholarly stand that Charles Leland invented the Gospel of Aradia, a position now also shown to have been incorrect with the publication of the new translation though Phoenix Books.The Triumph of the Moon appears to be yet another scholarly dismissal of the &quot;personal truths&quot; held by many modern Wiccans/Witches while at the same time white-washing the ongoing errors made by modern scholars in the study of Witchcraft. The truth, it seems, often lies directly halfway between opposing views. Well, maybe in the next book..."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"\\"Another such Triumph and we are ruined.\\" Pyrrhus 279 BCEUpdate added 9-7-2006. I am delighted to see that my review has inspired an army of Hutton-devotees to slap together substance-free positive reviews in order to try to counteract my negative review of \\"Triumph of the Moon\\" (see below). Prior to my review there had been only two reviews posted in the previous two years - but since my review there has been at least one a month! It's nice to be noticed. Thanks everyone! Now, on to the review itself.If Pagans are a little vague about exactly how our religion has survived, and a little awkward about exactly how our rites and rituals work, and if we sometimes make up stories to fill in the gaps in our history - maybe there's good reason for that. Maybe our sacred books were burned, and our Priestesses and Priests murdered, and our sacred places desecrated and destroyed. Maybe our Religion has been the target of a sustained campaign to destroy it!The simple fact is that Religions are very resilient things. They do not die easily. And when they are forced underground they sometimes change in strange and unexpected ways. Does anyone deny that Paganism was forced underground? Many religions have survived under similar circumstances - why must Pagans accept the triumphalist conclusions of our enemies that they succeeded in destroying our Religion? Why can't we just say \\"we're not dead yet\\"?Well, we're not dead. So there. Any person of good will would be sympathetic toward a Religion that has suffered so much persecution - and would be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to those who claim to be its continuators. And a good historian would much more carefully consider the evidence of Pagan survivals found in European intellectual, literary and artistic history, as well as in phenomena such as Alchemy, Qabalah, Magia, Astrology, the Tarot, etc.Here are some authors to read instead of Hutton:*** Pierre Hadot: Especially his \\"What Is Ancient Philosophy?\\" and \\"The Inner Citadel\\". Hadot is a serious philosopher who knows how to write about Ancient Philosophy for the intelligent non-specialist. These two books offer an excellent introduction to Pagan Philosophy!*** Perez Zagorin's \\"Ways of Lying: Dissimulation Persecution and Conformity in Early Modern Europe\\" on the phenomenon of underground Religious movements under Christendom. Also by Zagorin: \\"How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West\\" on the violent repression of intellectual and religious freedom under Christendom.*** Julia Annas: \\"The Morality of Happiness\\" and \\"Platonic Ethics Old and New\\". Whaddya know? The Christians didn't invent morality after all!*** Michael Gaddis: \\"There is No Crime For Those Who Have Christ\\" - sometimes a title says it all.*** Ramsay MacMullen: Especially his \\"Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries\\". This is THE book on the question \\"what happened to Paganism?\\"*** Pierre Chuvin: \\"Chronicle of the Last Pagans\\" - this comes right after MacMullen's book as among the most essential things for Pagans to read about our history.*** Lynn Roller: her \\"In Search of God the Mother\\" is a meaty tome covering the three \\"incarnations\\", so to speak, of Cybele: in Her native Anatolia, in the Hellenistic World, as lastly as the Roman Magna Mater. Roller also includes a fascinating and devastating critique of the scholarly research on Cybele.*** Antonia Tripolitis: her \\"Religions of the Hellnistic Roman Age\\" provides an accessible but also reliable overview of the Religious landscape in prior to the suppression of Paganism.*** Sarah Iles Johnston: her \\"Religions of the Ancient World\\" is a coffee-table book that covers a very broad range of Religious traditions in the mediterranean world prior to the suppression of all other Religions by the Christians. Also by Johnston: \\"Hekate Soteira\\" is an essential scholarly reference on Theurgy and the role of the Chaldean Oracles in Late Antiquity.*** Philippe Borgeaud \\"The Cult of Pan in Ancient Greece\\". Few aspects of Hutton's book demonstrate his ignorance of Paganism like his dismissal of the God Pan. Hutton ridicules the idea that Pan ever played a significant role in traditional Paganism. Hutton's theory is that Wiccans elevated Pan to a central role solely because of Pan's prominence in contemporary English language \\"romantic\\" literature. But of course Pan was a \\"major player\\" in Greek and Roman Paganism from the time of the battle of Marathon - as Borgeaud shows in this beautiful little book that every Pagan should read.*** Fraces Yates: Especially her \\"The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age\\", \\"The Rosicrucian Enlightenment\\" and \\"Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition\\".*** Gregory Shaw: \\"Theurgy and the Soul: the Neoplatonism of Iamblichus\\" Neoplatonism was the \\"last known address\\" of the classical Paganism of Antiquity - and it is the form in which Paganism begins to resurface during the Renaissance. Any genuine attempt to investigate whether or not Paganism managed to survive would not dismiss philosophical Paganism (and Platonism in particular) as a side issue, as Hutton does, but would make it a primary focus.*** Lucas Siorvanes: his \\"Proclus: Neo-Platonic Philosophy and Science\\" is another excellent book on Platonism as a Pagan philosophy in Late Antiquity.\\"Triumph of the Moon\\" is an anti-Pagan book. It has enjoyed a free-ride from Pagans because the vast majority of Pagans have never read a book with footnotes before. After having their brains addled by the works of Scott Cunningham and Silver Ravenwolf, Pagans have eagerly acclaimed Hutton their favorite \\"scholar\\". But what is Hutton saying in this book? His main argument can be stated in five words: Paganism is a made-up Religion. If you believe that, then you'll love his book.Curt Steinmetz"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. false authority. beware. sounds impressive but shoots self in foot repeatedly."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"The author's main focus in this book appears to be on pointing out a lack of evidence to support many of the claims made by many modern Wiccans regarding their religion and its history/origins. However, Mr. Hutton fails to understand that a lack of evidence does not equate to an evidence of lack.It would be convenient if things were really as black and white as Mr. Hutton views them, or if the topic of modern witchcraft were simply a matter of starting with the influence of Gerald Gardner and his cohorts. Unfortunately this is not the case, and there are more things on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in this book.Regretfully, Mr. Hutton glosses over the influence of Charles Leland, the true father of modern Wicca, and fails to see that virtually every basic aspect of Gardnerian Wicca can be identified in Leland's 19th century writings on Italian witchcraft. Leland's material depicts witches gathering nude at the time of the full moon, worshipping a male and female deity, working magic, and celebrating the sabbat with cakes and wine, etc. And yet Mr. Hutton states there is no evidence of anything resembling such aspects prior to Gerald Gardner's writings.I think the author was correct to state in the introduction that this book should have been subtitled a book on British witchcraft."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book is typical of those written on a subject like witchcraft without the author understanding (or being priviledged to) the inner mysteries. One of the many related errors made in this book can be illustrated by the following. The author compares modern Wicca/Witchcraft with ancient pagan religion and states that in modern Wicca there is no sacrifice within a ritual, that modern Wiccans feel the rite itself is enough to offer up to the gods. Actually, within modern Wicca/Witchcraft, the celebration of cakes and wine is the sacrifice of the slain god, the lord of the harvest.Modern Wicca/Witchcraft is typically divided into three levels of teachings. What is revealed to the public by Wiccans/Witches constitutes an outer level that is only suggestive of the concealed teachings. Unfortunately, the scholar's methodology is limited to what exists within the public domain. Therefore, his or her view is quite limited when examining secret societies, a fact that is well reflected in this book."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I have to admit that this book is well written, but it presents a very definite bias. It attempts to build a case for how modern witchcraft was invented and has no old roots at all, that nothing about witchcraft today has any connection to the witchcraft of the past. Instead, the roots of modern Craft stem from romanticized notions of the folklorist societies and so on. Which seems to disregard that the folklore societies had to get the info from somewhere.A close reading of the sections re Gerald Gardner has Hutton admitting that he can't really prove definitively that Gardner or the New Forest Coven made everything up...since everyone who was around at the time that he was using to collect his info from has proved to have not told the truth at one time or another, and there aren't enough documents available to scholars to sort fact from fiction.Some of Hutton's other works also go off of the claim that nothing survived the Reformation...a theory that is refuted by other authors, including Emma Wilby in her books. She insists that these practices and beliefs did survive among the country folk at least into the 1800's and that they kept it to themselves. Bringing these beliefs (even if fragmentary) into the 1800's brings it a lot closer to the old folks who were involved in the New Forest Coven and so closer to Gerald Gardner. There is no reason not to think that the New Forest Coven did not have at least a few of these old ideas, practices, and beliefs.Interesting book, but the theories are not proven. At least, not to my satisfaction. Try rounding out your own studies with Wilby, Ginzburg, and so on."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This could have been a good book, but unfortunately the author dresses up a great deal of speculation and parades it around as empirical truth. What I found most disturbing was his blatant attempts to discredit several key figures in modern Wicca who are now deceased and unable to respond to the author's allegations. Hutton even goes so far as to tell us what these people thought and what their motivations were, something which only they themselves truly knew and understood.Rounding up various contemporary Wiccan writers, much like the cavalry employed Indian scouts against their own people, Hutton uses them to trap selected bands of modern Wiccans with opposing views. It is always akward and disquieting to observe a scholar pounce on those who did not have the opportunity to obtain the levels of higher education held by the scholar, and yet still be held to his standards and subjected to his methodology.If you enjoy watching movies where bow &amp; arrow carrying Indians, stubbornly clinging to their ways and to their sacred lands, are cut down by soldiers with repeating rifles, then you are sure to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book is somewhat like swish cheese, it's full of holes but is still a tasty threat. Hutton's book is essentially an interesting theory on the evolution of Gardnerian Wicca in England. Unfortunately much of the thrust of Hutton's argument is deflated by a simple knowledge of the writings on classical witchcraft. Therefore several key arguments and points that Hutton tries to make are built upon a faulty foundation.Hutton claims that the idea that witches worship a triple aspect goddess is a totally modern concept and invention. However, the ancient writer Lucan (1st century CE) tells the tale of a group of witches that clearly indicates that such is not the case. In Lucan's work (LUC. B.C. 6:700-01) a witch makes the following comment: \\"Persephone, who is the third and lowest aspect of our goddess Hecate...\\" This of course portrays the concept of witches having a triformis or three-fold goddess, and the notion appears almost two thousand years prior to Gerald Gardner's time.In the ancient writer Ovid's tale (Met. 7:94-95) Jason swears an oath to the witch Medea, saying he would \\"be true by the sacred rites of the three-fold goddess.\\" Such writings clearly demonstrate that, contrary to scholarly opinion, the basic concept of a triformis goddess venerated in witchcraft is not a modern construction, and pre-exists the Romantic era and the work of Gerald Gardner and his cohorts.Hutton claims that poet Robert Graves invented the concept of maiden, mother, crone, and calls this Graves's \\"great gift to modern pagan witchcraft, the fully formed image of the Triple Moon Goddess.\\" However, the Roman poet Catullus, in the first century BCE, wrote of the goddess Diana as a \\"threefold\\" goddess who protects virgins, aids birthing mothers, fills barns with produce, and is \\"queen of the underworld.\\" It is not difficult to see the pre-existing concepts here related to maiden, mother, and crone. The ancient poet Horace writes of Diana as a goddess upon who witches call. Diana is identified with Hecate by a number of ancient sources.In Triumph of the Moon, Hutton states that other than the writings of Apuleius there is nothing to indicate that in ancient times was there a unified image of a major goddess associated with the moon and with Nature. Hutton essentially claims that what he calls the \\"atypical\\" image of Apuleius' goddess became the template for modern witchcraft's goddess figure. However, even a brief examination of ancient literature reveals otherwise. One example appears in the writings of Catullus, who in his Hymn to Diana (1st century BCE) equates the goddess Diana with the primary Roman goddess Juno. He also mentions an association with the bounty of Nature: \\"Diana whose name is Juno-Lucina...filling the farmer's rough-walled barn with fruit and produce, vegetables and grain.\\" Here we have an identification of Diana with an aspect of Juno (the Great Goddess), a connection to Nature, and an association with the moon through Diana.Another example of a major goddess associated wth the moon and with Nature is Hecate. In Hesiod's Theogony Hecate is described as being the most honored by Zeus, who granted to her a portion of the earth, sea, and the starry heavens. Hesiod also states that Hecate grants abundance to fisherman, herdsmen, and farmers, which associates her with Nature. The association of Hecate with the moon and with witchcraft is a long-standing tradition from classical times."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Small print, difficult to read.

However I thought that it was well done considering the immensity of the topic. There is quite a good amount of info on the old village healers, pellars, &quot;white witches&quot; (yes, damnit this term has historical origins before 1940)or whatever term was applied locally. I was disappointed about some of the information however. Hutton states that village healers did not attempt to cure fatal illness, that is not entirely true. Hutton also proves what some had already known, there were people who practiced and still DO practice Pre-Gardnerian traditions. (i.e. Andrew Chumbley!) Guess what? The Older Traditions practiced quite a bit of what could be called &quot;Christian Magic or &quot;Witchcraft&quot;. This little &quot;revelation&quot; will surely be a kick in the pants to some, as will other bits of info. that Hutton has written about. Read this book only if you want to have factual information.

He is a forthright historian, and realizes that their are holes in the story, which of course will lend itself to further historical study. As a historian, he is serving the truth by searching out the record and putting it into a cohesive whole. He, as well as other historians, will have to take the story forward from the point where this book leaves off, but it is an excellent begining to the story.Hutton may not be correct in all of his analysis and synthesis, but he is an honest &quot;task master&quot;. This book cannot be ignored by either pagan nor non-pagan. It's analysis of British Witchcraft origins is to be commended, and hopefully, equally relevant works will be published concerning such orgins in other countries. Such &quot;other works&quot; may illuminate the whole structure of paganism and thus enhance our understanding and appreciation for the pagan world view.His analysis of modern witchcraft and it's practitioners is enlightening and revealing. So many of these practitioners are still around and it might be hoped that an historian exists, or one may be found presently training in graduate school, who would be willing to consolidate their thoughts on their own origins which could be left for those who will live after them and would like to know their thoughts on the matter.Hopefully, books like this may clear our minds about our own pagan origins and allow us to go forward with knowledge as a tool, rather than ignorance as a bliss."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Ronald Hutton really knows his subject, I highly recommend this book to anyone curious about Paganism. This book is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"A good and detailed history of Paganism and Witchcraft, in the frame of Modern Age, at the Great Britain.Dr Hutton shows facts, events and persons whose help to \\"delivery\\" Paganism and Witchcraft to Modern and Contemporary Age. He agree more or less with Jeffrey Russel and Brooks Alexander that the modern paganism and witchcraft would be a religious movement fostered by de historical romantism. But the process of History can't be framed without any source of influences from previous facts, events and persons.But even then, it is a book that every pagan, witch and wiccan must to read."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"From the second page of the preface, when Hutton states, &quot;If it [neo-Paganism] is the child of any single phenomenon, then it is the belated offspring of the Romantic Movement,&quot; I was entranced. This book offers a beautiful argument on how the style of British Romanticism underlies the growth of neo-Paganism, just as it chronicles the growth of the contemporary neo-Pagan myth. (Note: I do not use &quot;myth&quot; as a negative; myth is not falsehood; myth, at least for this Romantic, is metaphor.) The book is a delight from beginning to end: a very affirmative portrait of contemporary neo-Paganism and yet an honest picture. The false geneology that seems a standard part of the neo-Pagan litany is thoroughly rejected, but the spiritual richness of the Pagan revival is accepted as sincere. A great piece of history writing."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book has made me rethink everything I have ever taken as &quot;fact&quot; regarding to Witchcraft. Published in 1999 by the Oxford University Press, this work is clearly held to very high academic standards. The book is divided into two sections, Macrocosm and Microcosm, with subdivisions including &quot;Finding a Goddess&quot;, &quot;Finding a Folklore,&quot; &quot;God (and Goddess) Parents,&quot; &quot;Gerald Gardner,&quot; &quot;Old Craft, New Craft,&quot; &quot;Uncle Sam and the Goddess,&quot; and &quot;Grandchildren of the Shadows.&quot;I mention the above to illustrate the wide context in which this book operates. It not only is interested in historical research devoted to what today's witches term &quot;the burning times,&quot; but also to the development of the modern witchcraft movement begun by Gardner. The manner in which Mr. Hutton presents the material is both academic and yet is readable-- he clearly states when his opinions are just that-- undocumented assumptions based on reason, versus that of proven ideas, thesis, etc. The earlier chapters are a little difficult to &quot;wade through&quot; at times, but the book is more reader friendly with each chapter.The reason Triumph of the Moon is so unique is because it provides facts little known to the general public that refute earlier research on the Witch Trials of the past as well as claims that the Wicca of today is a direct descendant of ancient pagan lineage.Although Mr. Hutton does not align himself with Wicca, Paginsim, or Witchcraft, he has been allowed to study, interview, and even circle with over 21 covens in England.This book is a must read for every Pagan, Wiccan, Witch or anyone interested in history. This is what history books should be printing"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton to my mind is an essential read for any practicing wiccan or witch. It's a historical book of two halves. The first half is an exploration & history of the facets that make up modern pagan witchcraft, such as the Goddess, the God, cunning folk, high ritual magic, secret societies, paganism etc, then the second half is an account of how the different strands came together. It's the first proper scholarly investigation by a respected historian, and helps avoid the pitfalls of false histories etc.It can also be used as a springboard by reading the works cited in each part so as to further an understanding of the Craft. For example, I'm currently reading Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, which is the book that Francis Barret ...create The Magus (which I have already read), and these together with Crowley's Magick (Book 4 & Magick in Theory and Practice, which is also well worth reading!) give a good basis for understanding the symbolism & reasons for certain ritual practice. By understanding the philosophy it also helps to create more effective ritual oneself (although I'm more spontaneous than planned ritual in general), and helps an understanding of the occult/esoteric/hidden laws of nature.I particularly agree with his comments that when Wicca was shown to be a modern development most people started to jump to \\"Traditional Witchcraft\\" etc, claiming it to be older in provinence, when it is blatantly obvious to anyone who has looked at the evidence that it has just as few roots in the past as Wicca.Triumph of the Moon, although historical in tone, is still sympathetic to Witchcraft & its practitioners, pointing out that it is a valid independent religion (and discussing why), not a cult, sect etc, that its modern origin makes it no less valid, & doesn't attempt to discuss whether spells, healing etc really work, only that people use it & there are cases in which the intended result seems to have occured.After reading it, although the romantic notion of an age old religion will be shown to be a fantasy (which deep down most people already suspected), and that it is a modern synthesis of older & new ideas, I for one found myself feeling better than ever about being a witch."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book is widely criticized; it seems that it has hit a nerve with some Pagans who believe, or want to believe, that Gerald Gardner revealed to the public a religion which had survived in secret since the Stone Age. (The other night I attended a Pagan gathering, at which a locally respected elder insisted, angrily, that the Druids were practicing recognizable Wicca in the stoneworks of Newgrange.)However, this book dispelled a completely opposite illusion from my mind. I had long suspected that Gerald Gardner had been a \\"dirty old man\\", who used a cursory knowledge of ceremonial magic to create a religion whose sole purpose was to get young women to disrobe for him. And that it took the timely arrival of Doreen Valiente to turn Wicca into an actual religion rather than just Gardner's personal fetish party. Hutton bursts that bubble as neatly as he bursts the \\"ancient survival\\" theorists' bubble. I came away from this book with respect for both Gardner and Valiente, as well as several other prominent early Wiccans, and even a bit of bemused affection for Aleister Crowley.Hutton shows that Gardner wasn't passing on an ancient tradition, but also that he wasn't just making it up out of nowhere. He traces Wicca's roots back to Romantic literature (no wonder I like paganism! I love the poetry), Masonry, cunning craft, ceremonial magic, spiritualism, and other fields. At the time Wicca was presented to the public, certain factors made it precisely what made sense in the culture of the times. From there, Hutton follows Wicca to the present day, and the forces of politics and psychology that have resulted in the Wicca we see today. (And he even mentions Rae Beth, my favorite but somewhat obscure 101 author.)Through all of this history runs a current that I don't think I'm imagining. I could be wrong, but I feel that between the lines of this scholarly, intellectual text is a deep interest and fascination with Wicca. I can almost see, in some places, where the author's enthusiasm almost breaks through the cool, collected prose. To those who say Hutton is hostile toward Wicca, I think you've missed that undercurrent. It bears mentioning that Hutton took flak in the scholarly community for his sympathy toward the Wiccan religion.This is a mature, intelligent book about the origins and history of Wicca, and I believe it marks a rite of passage for the religion as a whole. This is, finally, a book we can hand to our curious friends, and say, \\"This is where I'm coming from, this is what we're about\\", without embarrassment. This book made me more proud to be a Pagan than I've been in a long time."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"First, what this book is:...a long, exhaustive and highly engaging look at the social changes in England during the Romantic era, their influence on poetry and the interpretation of history, and how these attitudes, as well as the influence of secret societies like the Golden Dawn and Freemasons, contributed to the notion of witchcraft as an ancient fertility cult, and why and how this notion was brought to the forefront when, in 1954, a British civil servant claimed he had discovered a survival of this cult in New Forest, and published what were suposedly its inner secrets.What this book is not:...an attack on the credibility and intentions of Wicca's founders by a disgruntled accedemic hell-bent on \\"exposing\\" Wicca as a religious and historical farce within the context of an accedemic study.\\"Triumph of the Moon\\" represents to date, the only book of its caliber to take an in depth look at the history of pagan witchcraft not only from a historical point of view, but from a sociological and literary one as well. What we find when all is said and done is a book that will strengthen and solidfy the Wiccan beliefs of some, as it finally gives them a complete and coherrent historical account of their beliefs not intended to defame them, but to reveal Wicca as a religion born of poetry, literature and mysticism. For others, it will signal a death nill, as an (almost) irrefutable refutation of the, now discredited, notions of antiquity, ancient matriarchy, and survival(\\"the burning times\\") that many fundementalist Wiccans are still trying to sell to the public, and which serves as a lure for many new adherents.As a historical textbook, it's no less riveting. No other book so accurately, and with such detail, examines and interprets the goings-on of the occult community prior to, and during Wicca's compilation in the 1950's. The sheer cast of characters alone is staggering. (...)If there is a flaw however, it is that Hutton is too nice. The only author who he genuinely downplays and criticizes is Margaret Murray. And while he is quick to point out the errors and misrepresentations made by Wiccas founders(Gardner, Valiente) and the authors who contributed to it's source material(Graves, Frazer), he most often does this while attempting to isolate and play up their better points and/or best intentions. Which brings up another potential flaw, that he is too kind to modern pagans as well. In the chapter \\"Coming of Age\\" he describes Wicca as a religion rapidly maturing, and its adherents increasingly tending to disregard Gardner's story, the Murray thesis, and the erroneous myth of the burning times. Perhaps this is true in England, but in America, the inqueries made in the 90's into both pagan Wicca and its historical claims, and the dissapointing (to believers) conclusions made by these inqueries, have only served to divide serious Wiccans into bitter and opposing camps, with newcomers being totally clueless and their Wicca being almost entirely self-styled from fluffy Llewelyn books. Such individuals, sadly, make up the bulk of people calling themselves \\"Wiccan\\" at any given time these days. He also fails to mention most Wiccans' (both camps) continuing hatred of the traditional, fairy tale representation of the witch, denouncing this image as a misrepresentation of \\"true\\" witchcraft. I would argue that this image is an intergral aspect of the folklore upon which Wicca is based on, and should be reverred and cherished as yet another level of the witch's mystique. Most modern wiches are oblivious to this fact. My children are fed a steady diet of veggie burgers and the brothers Grimm, and I am pleased to inform you that they most assuredly believe in witches.Perhaps Hutton is working a little revisionist history of his own, bending the truth of Wicca's current state to give an example of how Wicca COULD redeem itself if it wanted to, and exemplifying a potential path that Wicca, and neo-paganism might take in it's long, hard road to accedemic and religious credibility. If this is his intention, then he proves to be Grave's and Murray's true heir in the developement of neo-paganism, using a bit of deception with the best intention of inspiring those who read it to do something new and positive. But as a testement to paganism's, indeed growing, maturity, this time the deception is a conscious one, serves a specific and useful purpose, and everyone is in on it.Blessed Be. Yes, this review was written by a Wiccan.note: as I stated, the book's few flaws are open to interpretation, and don't necessarily amount to factual errors, or at least they don't ammount to factual errors of the type Wiccans are famous for spouting, and for what it's worth, that is, a historical overview of the developement of Wicca and neo-paganism, you will not find a finer book available, therefore it still gets a perfect five stars."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I found this book very informative and accessible to read. It lacks the wild fantasy and highly incredible prose of the &quot;believers&quot; for or against Wicca and yet it contains respect for both.

It was particularly illuminating to have someone (Hutton) investigate most everyone who claimed to study or be initiated by Crowley by going back to Crowleys extensive day to day diary and see that that persons name didn't appear on the day in question or even weeks ahead or behind \\"the day.\\"About Hutton's \\"bias\\" that so many here have commented on: I believe his Bias is \\"the truth.\\" While he systematically debunks the claims of many in the early times by looking at facts, timelines or places, he treats everyone fairly especially Crowley, Gardner, Valiente and Cochrane. He refutes the claims of Crowley being a Satanist; going against the grain of the anti-Gardner backlash, he gives Gardner his due of inventing a genuine original modern religion; Valente as being the author of much of Wiccas wonderful poetry but at the same time tending to believe in \\"evil\\" craft purely from newspaper article evidence, and the firebrand Cochrane who despite alienating everyone in his later life, was able to lead rituals that \\"genuinely swept up and transformed\\" participants.Huttons tone throughout his work is always upbeat and never harsh or accusatory. The general feeling after finishing and reflecting on this work is that Hutton has tried to give modern Pagan witchcraft a more solid footing by addressing all of the troubling aspects of the craft (namely its history) by an apologist allowing the culture to come up with their own answers and come to terms with the colorful characters of their spirituality."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Prof. Hutton has done a thorough job of looking at the British part of the neopagan equation. There is little I can add to the many excellent reviews here, except to say that this book belongs on the bookshelf of every person interested in the roots of neopaganism, whether armchair occultist, practicing pagan, or nonpagan trying to understand the origins and growth of such paths as Wicca.For those who may be uncomfortable or disillusioned by the historical evidence, realize that _authenticity_ (the truth of a matter as a historical artifact) is not necessarily the same as _validity_ (the practical side of truth).

Dr.Hutton has given the Neo-Pagan community a book that it has desperately needed for over 30 years. A sober, well documented account of the immediate roots of the 20th century neo-Pagan movement. He surveys the English romantic poets, German romanticism, British folk magic and the high ritual magic groups of the 19th century to provide primary documentation on the development of the emerging paganism. It is also a good antidote for those who claim that all modern occultism and the idea of Neo-Paganism started in the sixties as a hippy fad. We find here that ideas in witchcraft, Wicca and many New Age teachings go back well into the 18th century, and some to the Renaissance and the ancient world.The first part of the book,\\"Macrocosm\\", is an overview of the period from 1800 to 1940. The first chapter sets the stage for this by discussing the four different views of pre-Christian and non-Christian religions that were held by various people during the nineteenth century. Here he traces the emerging interest in reviving pagan ideas, which was one of these views. The following chapters examine specific elements of the movement, like God, Goddess, high magic, folk magic, witchcraft, and folklore. The second half of the book, \\"Microcosm\\" examines specific people and events in the development of modern witchcraft during the 20th century. (...)It should be noted that this book does not give you spells or rituals. It is not a how-to book, but simply historic and cultural background. And it is written by someone who is not antagonistic towards Neo-Paganism. In the second chapter, Hutton declares that, although he is tracing the history of the idea of Goddess as taught by modern witches, this does not mean that a God and Goddess are simply ideas created by men. Indeed, he acknowledges that theological conclusions are outside the realm of a historian. He suggests that it is possible that the gods are simply reasserting themselves in people's consciousness.But even this suggestion is not one upon which a historian can make an authoritative pronouncment.There are only two small flaws to the book. First, Hutton could have added one more chapter giving some better background on Hermetic philosophy, tying it into neo-Platonic theory and Gnosticism. Wicca is, after all, a form of Hermetic magic, but one that uses pagan principles instead of Christian principles like the Masons or the Rosicrucians. (...) Also, I think Hutton gives too much credit to Gerald Gardner as the inventor of Wicca, whereas I strongly feel that Wicca was emerging for about 50 years before Gardner's involvement. But Hutton does say that this is only a history of modern pagan witchcraft, not \\"The\\" history. But for now, it is one of the best out there for the practitioner and layman alike. Wicca does have a legitimate history and it is even more fascinating then the tripe usually found in modern witchcraft books."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Mr. Hutton, as usual, does an excellent job of providing information about the craft as he knows it well. Easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This is a wonderfully well reseached and scholarly book.

We've been saying this for years, and if Hutton is WRONG, as some here have stated, surely someone can come along with source material and set him right."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"What struck me most while reading this book is that it raised the image, time and time again, of the conscious mind trying to understand the elements of a dream. In the final analysis, I found this book to be typical of the historians approach to studying religion and the sacred, meaning it is like a person born and raised in a wealthy family writing about the views of poor people.In Triumph of the Moon, Hutton tries to make a case for where the concepts found in modern Wiccan originated, using the poetry and philosophy of various writers he feels were key figures in the evolution of modern witchcraft. Hutton focuses largely on writings produced between the 14th and 19th century. Even though much of the content of these writings are based upon pre-existing myths, ancient deities, archaic beliefs and practices, Hutton treats the material of those he cites as being made up out of whole cloth. This fits his agenda nicely, but poorly serves both the readers of this book and the insights of the authors examined by Hutton.An example of one of Hutton's targets is Robert Graves, and Graves' book The White Goddess. Hutton claims that Graves essentially invented the Triformis Goddess known in Wicca, and her association with the moon as well as the concept of Mother, Maiden, Crone. However, ancient Greek and Roman writers spoke of Hecate and Diana/Artemis as a triformis goddess (often calling her Trivia, goddess of the three roads) and these goddesses were indentified with witches even as late as the first century BC in the writings of Horace, Ovid, and Lucan. Additionally, the image of the Mother, Maiden and Crone appears in the iconography of ancient Greece and Rome in the image of the three Fates. Therefore, it is quite clear that Graves did not invent these concepts.Hutton conveniently dimisses the writings of various historians and commentators such as Michelet, Gomme, Tartarotti, Jancke, Mone and others who held that witchcraft was, to one degree or another, the survival of ancient pagan religion. Hutton ultimately deals with their views as being essentially flights of fancy, and in doing so fails to realize the power and influence of the Muse, as only a historian can.Joseph Campbell once said that we have two levels and modes of consciousness, the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. He pointed out that each one comprises 50% of our accumulative consciousness, and yet we rely upon only the one half, the conscious mind and its view of the world. In this regard, we can truly say that Hutton's book is indeed a half-brained idea."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"The Triumph of the Moon, by Hutton,Hutton is a British historian who has spent 10 years or so researching pagan history. He recent book deals with the social and cultural forces that led to the emergence of Wicca in the middle of the 20th century. He then chronicles the major trends in Wicca in the last half of the 20th century. In one chapter he discusses the Starhawk/Budapest feminist California liberal misandrist turn that paganism took in the 1980s. Hutton describes how their badly misandrist and overly emotional writing lacked any scholarly credibility, but nevertheless had a major impact of Wicca and paganism in general for two decades. With publication of Hutton's book and others we are finally beginning to see some signs of returning to a more balanced pagan literature.His history is incomplete however, and he makes some of the same mistakes and assertions that he criticizes others for making. For example in the first half of the book Hutton extensively details literary references to witches and claims about historic roots. Many pages are each devoted to Margaret Murray and others. Then toward the end he waives off all of that in a page or two by simply asserting that it has been disproved. He provides nothing close to supporting data to demonstrate that claim. A few years ago I attended a workshop by Dolores Ashcroft-Nowikci (21 books and other publications listed on Amazon) where she described in detail her study of an actual pagan village that kept itself hidden since the Norman invasion, and which had written records of village life since that time. According to Nowicki the village was finally over run by urban sprawl in 1990 but most of the residents have relocated to a new hidden village that still follows pre-christian pagan traditions. Nowicki says that her mother was born in the pagan village. Either Nowicki was lying to everyone who has attended her workshops describing the pagan village, or Hutton's scholarship that \\"disproved\\" the survival of actual pagan villages is sadly lacking. I have also researched or become aware of several other pieces of information that leads me to believe 1) that some of the historical witch trials and hangings were in fact people whom modern pagans would recognize as pagan witches, and 2) that some family tradition witches were actually surviving pagan witches. Hutton asserts that all claims to any pagan survival have been disproved, and in fact are not possible, but he offers no proof and provides no data. A widely published author, Initiate Wiccan HPS, and leader of a Ceremonial Magick society in the UK such as Ashcroft-Nowicki cannot be waived off by assertion without some evidence that her claims are false. My own family admitted to being witches at the Salem trials, but their stories have been deleted from current histories rather than researched and discounted. You won't find their names on lists of witch trial victims published in the last half century. Today's historians would rather claim that all the witch trial victims were really Christians. That's not scholorship, that's just avoiding the disagreable facts.On the positive side Hutton does provide a lot of information about Gardner and subsequent Wiccan history. His observations about the state of Wicca today are interesting. I was especially fascinated by the discussion trying to fit Wicca into anyone's scholarly classification system for religions and religious branches. Wicca, it seems, doesn't fit any classification system and religious scholars don't know what even to call it. I would recommend the book to all Wiccans and interested parties, but keep in mind that it's not the last word on a lack of pagan roots."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book was a very enjoyable read, partly for the quality of the writing style, partly for the way it catalogues so many interesting people, events and ideas, and partly for the thrill of the hunt as I tracked down and nailed mistake after mistake.In a work of this scope a few factual errors are to be expected, but the sheer number of these errors, and the immensity of some of his misrepresentations is staggering, especially from someone who claims to be unbiased, and to have not left any significant silences.Hutton's scholarly yet entertaining tone has starstruck a generation of pagans who previously had seen nothing better than Llewellyn's books (note all the 5-star reviews), however, his scholarship is full of big, black, holes.The main thrust of the book is to destroy any possibility of any kind of history or continuity to pre-Gardnerian \\"Wicca\\" or witchcraft. This is fine up to a point, but in his anti-Murray-ist zeal he goes so far as to conclude that not one single practitioner of any kind of pagan religion was persecuted in Europe during the time of the witch trials (1400-1700).To support this extreme claim he employs character assassination against such people as Gardner and Leland (supported on a series of shaky or downright wrong information), quotes other authors very selectively or out of context, paints quite unrealistic pictures of historical folk-magic (for instance, describing English cunning folk as isolated and having little or no contact with each other, and getting all their skills by mail order from London, when contemporary accounts describe that in some areas there were as many cunning-folk as parish priests).He criticises the eminent scholar and historian Carlo Ginzburg (certainly a more rigorous scholar than Hutton) of supporting Margaret Murray, but seems to have either not read, or somehow not understood Ginzburg's books which he has quoted from. He even at one point gives a list of authors who supposedly agree with him that no condemned \\"witches\\" held pagan religious beliefs - however if you actually read these authors, you will find that only one or two of them make any such claim, and in fact about half of them seem to take quite the opposite view, suggesting all kinds of connections with pre-christian religion (and giving lots of evidence in support).Hutton doesn't even attempt to address the wealth of previous work that has gone into understanding the pre-christian religions of Europe and their continuation through folk-lore and custom. Folklorists like Jacob Grimm may have written some years ago when different academic approaches were in vogue, but this doesn't give Hutton license to entirely ignore their seminal works. There is an enormously different picture to be painted if you read just the authors Hutton has cited, let alone if you expand into wider areas such as folklore and legislation.I really did enjoy reading this book, and I see it offering a good starting point for other better-prepared researchers, providing as it does such a nice catalogue of people and ideas (also, research is more fun when you have a contentious point or two to argue over). However as a book to be read and believed by Wiccans and pagans it is a tragedy. Instead of tracing the development of modern Wicca and witchcraft in a fair light, he stamps on these thin tenuous roots and casts a blackening smokescreen across what is already a dim enough area of history.UPDATE: After writing this review way back in 2002 I continued reading Hutton's references and retracing his steps, and uncovered further extensive errors. While the history he provides from the 1950s onwards is mostly pretty good, his treatments of previous periods, all the way back to prehistory, are out of step with common scholarly consensus, and potentially highly misleading. I have now published a full-length critique:Trials of the Moon: Reopening the Case for Historical Witchcraft."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I would not necessarily disagree with any particular point Hutton makes. Much of what he states is nearly self-evident rather than surprising to any individual who is well read in the area of Modern Paganism, but the number of resources he has brought together make this book worth reading simply as a reference. It is an excellent who's who of occult figures providing ample information on possible biases they may have. It also successfully catalogs and presents many of the arguments about the origins of Modern Witchcraft. That said his theories aren't truly proven and his writing often falls just short of providing the details that would even allow one to truly judge his inferences, suppositions and the conclusions. He too is guilty of many of the literary failings of which he accuses his subjects. Unproven though his theories, inferences, suppositions and conclusions may be they do provide ample food for thought and are certainly worth considering. \\"Triumph of the Moon\\" is a very slow read, but worth plodding through."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Amazing book tracing the evolution of the neopagan movement and a must read for intelligent people who are interested in the Wiccan religion.

But for the truly dedicated Wiccan who has a hunger to understand and follow the historical threads, this is the book to read. If you still want to pursue Magic of any sort after you finish this book, then you will embrace the Call as a well-informed practitioner rather than just a game-player or poser."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I read this in a library edition several years ago, and recently picked up a new copy to reread as my memory of it had become somewhat foggy. Unfortunately, I neglected to purchase a full-page or multi-line magnifier along with it, so I have only been able to read one or two pages at a sitting before having to reach for the aspirin bottle - the print is painfully small. This is an exceptional book and it's too bad that the print size may drive some readers away. I strongly recommend the purchase of a good magnifier, because this book is really much too interesting to have to put down every few pages! (I also recommend a highlighter, a very-fine-point pen for commenting in the margins, and several hundred Post-It Notes!) The printing detracts so much from the experience of the book that I downgrade it by a full two stars.I also do admit a minor quibble in wishing that it were footnoted rather than endnoted, since footnotes are much easier to reference without losing the flow of the reading.The people who would scream the most about this book are the ones who need to read it the most. As a (neo)pagan perpetually frustrated with all the gloppy revisionist pseudohistories purporting the existence of &quot;egalitarian matriarchal&quot; (huh!?) &quot;vegetarian societies without war or violence where everyone created lots of (essentially monotheistic) Goddess-oriented art until the evil nasty patriarchy came along and messed it all up, but a few heroic women in each generation kept it alive - despite being burned to death on a regular basis - until modern times&quot; I welcome this metaphorical and metaphysical dose of salts."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Having given up in defeat after attempting to wander through other alleged &quot;histories of modern Wicca&quot; that turned out to be nothing more than the author's pet fantasies, I asked a well-known Wiccan author and teacher what would be her recommendation. She recommended this book. She wasn't wrong.This book is every bit as good as the positive reviewers say it is, so I won't comment in that area. What I fail to understand is the vehemence of this book's critics, especially those who seem fixated on defending their favorite authors. Hutton is not terribly kind to some authors, yes. But the negative reactions seem to indicate that some people take the words of those authors as a kind of &quot;gospel.&quot; Is that wise?What I do find fascinating is that even though some of the great sacred cows of Wicca/Paganism are done away with, other, even more surprising facts raise their heads. Why is it, for example that even in the most repressive of times, the Goddess will not be effaced? If She will not be worshiped in the churches, then She appears to the poets of the Romantic era. A country cleric, for no good reason, becomes infatuated with Pan and erects a statue to Him in front of a church, simply based on a mis-hearing of the shouting of a group of villagers. There are many such oddities scattered throughout the book. Doesn't it strike anyone else as very odd that the Old Gods and Goddesses keep manifesting themselves, in multitudes of ways, no matter what?The histories of the &quot;major occultists,&quot; are interesting, but behind Hutton's exploration of the lives of people like Graves, Gardner, Crowley, Dion Fortune, Mathers, et. al., there is a subtle running stream of continuity. The Old Gods manifest throughout Hutton's history; not in the traditional common ways that many Wiccans and Pagans were taught, but in even more mysterious glimpses, working through historical figures who have otherwise been forgotten, dropping hints and ideas in old books that somehow magically are picked up by the right person at the right time and read...Perhaps in this book some of our Wiccan and Pagan idols are knocked off their pedestals. Some survive the fall and some do not. But if you look behind all this remarkable scholarship and read the facts that Hutton has put here, you find an astonishing record of how the Old Gods, working behind the scenes, continue to manifest themselves by any means necessary.Is this too religious a view of this book? Probably. I'm sure Hutton's intent was never to show such things. But he has, will he or nil he. It's there to be seen."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This type of accurate scholarly work is so needed in the pagan community these days. Wicca, which is never to be confused with witchcraft, has it's interesting inception unveiled here. Seems like an English nudist and former civil servant wanted to create a new religion. And to do so he used some already existing sources, and heavily edited others. Pretty impressive to create a new religion; so I give Gerald and his folks their due. I find it sad that his creativity cannot be applauded. Instead, some wiccans feel that validity is only to be found in being the one true and authentic remnant of the \\"old religion\\". This is an important book in helping the new age community and the xtian fundamentalists finally \\"get it right\\" with their terminology. Witches do not practice wicca; wiccans do. Maybe in a future book the author can explore where those two terms try to meet in the new reconstructuralist pagan traditions."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This book gives a clear, convincing history of the development of the 'religion' of witchcraft, showing quite clearly that the movement is 20th century in origin, and that extravagant claims about the antiquitiy of the religion have no basis in reality. Mr hutton shows that claims about the ancient origins of the witchcraft religion are nonsense, but he is always kind and polite, and never ridicules the beliefs of modern wiccans, he must be the world's most tactful historian. An earlier review of this book claims to have attended a workshop by someone who says she knows of a 'hidden' Pagan village in England, dating back to before the Norman conquest and only discovered in the 1990s. I don't think this reviewer can ever have been to England. We are a very small country, with 9as P.J. O'Rourke puts it)'A population density like Macy's toy department at Christmas'. There aren't any hidden Pagan villages here because there's nowhere to hide them, okay?"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"Hutton has done the research I would have wanted to do in his place. He has sought out and carefully analyzed as many original documents as he could find and has united that with his understanding of the history of the English people (as opposed to battles, wars, fearless and fearful leaders, and economic revolutions) to produce the first honestly approached AND accurately documented analysis of Wicca. Hutton earned my respect in &quot;The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles&quot; and my thanks with the &quot;moon&quot;. Best of all, this is not some sort of &quot;expose&quot; which hides an attack within (supposedly) historical explorations. Few Wiccans have treated the religion as a whole with the courtesy and understanding shown in this book."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"A lot of books on Pagan history have proven to be long on &quot;wishcraft&quot; and short on historical accuracy or scholarship. Origins of Modern Witchcraft by Ann Moura is a very recent (and perfect) example of this.Ronald Hutton's Triumph of the Moon - a History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, however, is a very different matter. It is a meticulously researched, however tentative, history of the NeoPagan movement, with a thorough bibliographical section to direct the reader to further study and research. He describes Wicca, or as he calls it Pagan Witchcraft, as an Old Religion/New Religion, uniquely English and European in origin, with many of its key elements and concepts coming straight out of the Romantic Era, particulary its poetry, and others coming from truly ancient sources.Hutton is not Pagan (he is a Professor of History at the University of Bristol), yet he definately considers the NeoPagan movement worthy of more research and study, especially because, as he writes, &quot;it is the only religion which England has ever given the world&quot; While he is often quite critical in his examination of the major players in the development of the Pagan novement (i.e Gerald Gardner, Aelister Crowley, Margaret Murray) and refutes many Wiccan claims regarding the supposedly ancient origins of modern Wicca, he leaves no doubt at the end that Paganisn has evolved into a coherent social and religious movement, one that has moved far beyond what Gardener could ever have imagined,He concludes, &quot;Pagan witchcraft qualifies as a full-blown, independent religion. It is more than a shared set of stories, language, or images, and more than a common store of deities and texts. It has a common identity and a common institutional structure, of the coven supplemented by solitary practice of the same tradition. It is more than the veneration of a single diety or object, and has not seperated off from a larger religious body or movement.&quot; Hardly news to Pagans, but something that many Christian and secular critics of Paganism in the U.S. - including President Bush - have yet to discover.Triumph of the Moon sets a new standard for historical research into Paganism's origins and its potential contributions to the world. It also serves as a call and challenge for more research. I recommend it most highly to both Pagan and non-Pagan readers."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"This is a pioneering work, the first history of the Neo-Pagan movement which (note Mr. Hutton himself admits the diffculty of the task)gives a full scholarly review of the Pagan movement, its history and the ideas and cultural background of its tenents. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"OK, it's a cliche, but it's true: if you only ever read one book on Wicca and modern neo-paganism, read this one! It will dissuade even the most hardcore Wiccan of the idea that Wicca is anything other than a purely modern invention. Although that doesn't invalidate it as a religion per se, it does demolish the myth that Wiccans are following an ancient religion that existed prior to the coming of Christianity."},{"Title":"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft","review":"I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism, but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side, because they helped contribute, Freemasons, Aleister Crowley, and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall, excellent book, well-written, and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism, Wicca, or modern witchcraft!"},{"Title":"E-business Systems and Architecture for E-procurement and E-sourcing","review":"I have a procurement and supply chain background and found this book to be quite interesting as it provides the technology and Internet face of the procurment and sourcing issues. The report covers a number of technology issues and appropriate eBusiness solutions for most types of procurement. The vendor index and their offerings at the end of the book was good to have. A good book to look into if you are getting into building or enhancing your procurement systems."},{"Title":"The Handgun in Personal Defense","review":"I checked this book out from my local public library. The information contained within is generally good. There are nuggets of valuable information that helped me come up to speed on the domain of using a handgun for personal defense.This book will fit the bill for newcomers to handguns and existing pistol owners who want to learn how to prepare themselves for personal defense. Novices to firearms of all kinds may start out a little confused. This is not a Handguns for Dummies type book.The wound potential, cartridge info and the drills were especially of interest to me.The writing leaves a lot to be desired. This book would have been better if the author had hired a polished editor. I often had to read sentences multiple times in order to understand them because of the way they were worded. There were several typos, which eventually lead you to think the book was rushed to market without any editor at all.Another problem is that the photos inserted are rarely mentioned in the text. Normally, photos are added to books to aid in the understanding of the text. Those in this book are supplemental, but not referenced, so they feel like afterthoughts, pasted in after the text was all written.The chapter on cartridges (i.e. calibers) would have been much better if each caliber that was described had a nice close-up photo next to a coin for size reference. The stance photos are too small and not close up enough to identify the important elements that distinguish one from another (Weaver vs horse vs Isosceles).Yet another problem is the use of jargon without including some kind of glossary or footnotes to explain them. If you don't already hang out with others at the shooting range, some of the jargon will go right past you. Cliches like \\"...will carry the day\\" are overused, tiresome and pretentious.Lastly, I was disappointed with the lack of attention paid to concealed carry. With the title \\"The Handgun in Personal Defense\\", you'd think there would be a whole chapter on gun sizes (frame height, grip width, barrel length), holster locations and even the laws for CC. But there was very little information provided.The top 50 fighting handguns was a good chapter, but the author doesn't explain the order in which they are presented. He also admits that if he couldn't get his hands on it, he didn't include it. Admirable, but a list of good reputable albeit personally untested guns would not have gone amiss. I'm sure there are dozens of experienced folks who read this and wonder \\"What about the Blarg D40? I've had that gun for years and it's my favorite!\\"If you can ignore the very average writing and look for the nuggets of information contained within, you'll get something out of this book. It's worth one read through. For me, I'm glad I checked it out for free and didn't plunk down the $15 MSRP. If I ever find it used for under $7, I'll probably go ahead and buy it."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"This is a delightful book with a tender dialogue and gentle words thathelps young children to understand death.

I guess I just figured that if the discussion was normal now, then it would be so much easier for him when he does have to deal with the death of our cat, or a grandparent, or anyone or -thing else.The book came in the mail last week so, before work, I sat down to give it a read. This book does do a wonderful job explaining how every life has a beginning and end, and how different lifetimes apply to different living things. It does say something along the lines of \\"that may be sad\\" to quickly address feelings, but it doesn't harp on feelings.I'm really glad I purchased the book.

But this is the only book I regularly give copies of to families. The \\"de-personalized\\" way it talks about death, the universality of its text combined with soft drawings and repetition are very soothing. This is NOT a book about emotions or stages of death. (If you are looking for one of those Everett Anderson's Goodbye is a positive place to start.)This is a book about the rhythm of life and death for all creatures, for everything that is born. One of the best parts of the book is its emphasis on what a lifetime is, and how it is framed by birth and death, and that inbetween those \\"markers\\" is what is important. It explains that different creatures have different life spans, and that this aspect of nature is neither fair nor unfair. It simply is.I do not restrict this book to times when a child is grieving,I include it in our regular reading rotation, so that the children see death as a normal part of life experiences. Death is so emotionally charged, especially for the grown ups, that having a calm book is especially worthwhile. When a child is actually grieving balancing the more \\"intense\\" books with this soothing one, does wonders."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"After losing my wife (33 years old) two years ago, this was one of the books that was recommended to me .... and I am glad I took the recommendation. This is a GREAT book for explaining the subject of lifetimes to children, especially in the 3-5 year old range.What is great about this book and something I didn't realize at the time was that lifetimes didn't have to only related to death of people. EVERYTHING has a lifetime and it has helped my daughter in many ways. A couple months ago, when my daughter's balloon popped and she was very sad, she said \\"Dad, I guess my balloon's lifetime is over\\", and then she went to throw it away. She was sad but understood the concept that all things, living and unliving, have a lifetime. We still use the concepts today on a regular basis, and she still likes to read the book as well.HIGHLY recommended, even for those children that haven't had to deal with true loss or death yet ... at least in my opinion."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"I heard about this book and decided to take a look before I needed it. I know that eventually my child will start asking questions about death, and I'd like to know what resources are available. I was particularly drawn to this title because it can be tailored to a variety of religious belief systems. I disagree with a previous poster who stated that this book teaches that there is no afterlife. The way I read it, the book doesn't take a stand either way. Being \\"alive\\" on earth is not the same thing as \\"eternal life\\" in the religions I am familiar with. No religion I know of denies that earthly bodies are alive and then they die.I like the fact that this book compares all types of organisms from plants to animals to people. The concept of a life span ties it all together. What is \\"in between\\" the beginning and ending of a life is living. I appreciate that this book emphasizes the in between, and therefore strikes a positive note.I would caution against using this book as a regular picture book for toddlers and older preschoolers because it may actually introduce the idea of death before a child is able to comprehend the explanation. However, I think it's an excellent choice for a child who is asking about death or who has recently experienced the loss of a pet, friend, or relative."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"This book would be effective for grief therapy and for teaching about life cycles. It specifically answers the question: What is a lifetime?My daughter, age 4, had a lot of questions about death. She was most especially interested in finding out when her \\"dying day\\" would be. This book seemed to help her understand that everyone's lifetime is special to them. I wanted her to understand that because someone else died it doesn't mean her death is imminent. A common fear among the young.An exquisitely illustrated and plainly written book, it speaks clearly to the children about a complicated subject. I highly recommend it for all home and school libraries for ages three and up. It should be used as part of a comprehensive set of books on biological and familial concepts as it is not meant to answer all of a child's questions on life cycles, grief, death or dying."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated, and it explains the facts of life and death in a very direct and unsentimental way: all creatures have a lifetime, then they die. The book discusses the lifetimes of different living creatures, from insects who only live a few days, to large mammals who live many years. It describes people as living for &quot;sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more.&quot; That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health. &quot;Lifetimes&quot; explains the concepts of lifespan and death, but does not offer comfort for those who fear death or are grieving. I recommend the book &quot;Gentle Willow&quot; for those who want a gentler, more comforting story, that is no less true to fact."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"This book is direct in its approach to addressing life and death. It is very matter of fact. As I read and re-read this book, I had an empty feeling. I felt that the book was simple and was a good resource for adult and children but I would need to couple it with other books that would elicit more feelings. In and of itself, I was left with an understanding of life having a beginning and an end. The life lived was different for every living thing including human beings. As I ended to story, something was missing. It felt more clinical and scientific. It did not address the emotional component or the spiritual components of life and death very well. I feel it will be a good reference and a good addition to our library, but would also offer other books to be read in addition to this one."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"Lifetimes is a gently beautiful introduction to death and grief for young children.

Every child enjoys the book's soothing text and lovely pictures.

Most of the books in the kid section were way too advanced. This is the only one I found that I was comfortable even trying to read to him. After a few reads he seemed to have a good understanding of the book.However the book could be improved in a couple of ways. First the cadence of the writing and starting a thought on one page and finishing it on the next can make it awkward to read, especially if you read slowly and talk about the illustrations. Secondly there is an injured butterfly shown early in the book who has died. But later on there is a healthy butterfly shown - this confuses my child as he thinks the butterfly got better. This undermines the message of the first butterfly, that sometimes things get so badly hurt that they cannot be repaired."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"Knowing and working with many young children, I have come to appreciate that there are certain concepts that we, as adults, tend to take for granted as being somehow obvious or, if you will, self-evident. One of these is the inevitability of death. Trying to explain death to a child - particularly to a very young ( 2 - 4 year old) child can be an exasperating experience for even the most well meaning parent, teacher or concerned adult. Luckily, there is a growing body of literature, written to be looked at while being read to youngsters that simplify the essential concept sown to a level that can be understood by the child and will suffice until the child lets us know, through their ever more sophisticated questions, that they need more information. I have a collection of such books that I use and recommend to parents, where death has been a recent event in the family, for use with their children. This book by Bryan Mellonie and Robert Ingpen, is the one I most frequently recommend for use with this youngest group of children.Each page contains a minimum of words with an illustration on the facing page - of which there are only about 20. Immediately, by design, the most common adult well-intentioned error is defeated: that involving giving into the propensity to talk TOO MUCH; to use TOO MANY WORDS; to try to explain the idea in a way that the young child is no where near ready to grasp yet. The initial page and illustration present an exemplary example. On the right side is a simple, hand-drawn illustration of a bird's nest containing two eggs. On the facing (left side) page, the following is the entirety of the text:There is a beginningAnd there is an ending for everythingThat is alive.In between is living.The rest of the text and illustrations bring this same basic idea home to kids via references all manner of living things. Sea creatures, plants, people, birds, trees and insects among them. On the fourth page across from a drawing of a crab:Nothing that is aliveGoes on living forever.How long it lives depends uponWhat it is and what happensWhile it is living.The next-to-last page:So, no matter how long they are,Or how short, lifetimes are reallyAll the same.They have beginnings, and endings,And there is living in between.Young children cannot be expected to understand death as we adults do - or believe we do. The decomposition of bodies, the questions of life-after-death, issues involving illness and disease: all of these are beyond the scope of conceptual understanding of the average pre-schooler. Keep it simple until more complex questions are forthcoming from the child. This book is a good first step in what is apt to be a prolonged, increasingly complex process.If sadness should befall your family (or a pet, or a friend, etc.) and you have a pre-schooler , take a look at this book and ask yourself if it might not be a good place to begin explaining things to YOUR child. I would certainly use it for mine."},{"Title":"Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children","review":"This book is a &quot;life cycles&quot; book.

However at one point it states that people live for \\"sixty or seventy years, sometimes even more.\\" As another reviewer noted, \\"That is a little scary for a child whose grandparents are already way past those ages and still in great health.\\" It's also a bit off the mark, given that life expectancy in the US is close to 80, so 70 or 80 years might be more accurate...but I would have avoided putting a number on it myself.I also agree with other reviewers that the picture of the dead butterfly, followed by one of a live butterfly of the same species is confusing.

However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: \\"Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever.\\" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement.

It's much more detailed than I expected and I came away with a real sense of how to find trout as quickly as possible."},{"Title":"Strategies for Stillwater","review":"The typical flyfishing book concentrates on fishing streams of one sort or another. But trout lakes and ponds are often easier to find than good trout streams. Those who have spent any time fishing lakes know that there are some significant differences between the two venues. In this expansive tome Hughes covers stillwater flyfishing from top to bottom.The book is broken into three parts: &quot;reading stillwaters&quot; which discusses the nature of the lake environment; &quot;strategies for stillwater&quot; which equipment, boats, trout behavior and fishing techniques; and &quot;lake food forms and their imitations&quot; which describes each class of fish food along with how to both select (or tie) an imitation and convincingly fish it.The book is well organized and complete without being tedious; Hughes' prose provides pleasant reading. I know that I'll be a better lake fisher for reading this book."},{"Title":"Strategies for Stillwater","review":"Dave Hughes has successfully published a number of books on trout fishing. Strategies for Stillwater gives cogent, concise information concerning the way lakes \\"work\\" and tips on how to locate trout in them. I wish, however, that Hughes would update the book. A lot has happened since it he wrote it.For example, pontoon boats on lakes are now very popular. While Hughes describes the pros and cons of prams and float tubes, he doesn't touch on pontoon boats because they weren't around (at least in any great numbers) when the book was written.There are now a lot more line options for stillwater. I would like Hughes' take on them.Finally, the patterns described in the book, while venerable, have given way to more \\"modern\\" imitations. For example, the patterns for the nymphs of damsels, dragonflies, and callebaetis have changed substantially in the last ten years. Beadhead flies, which have become a flyfishing staple, get no mention because they were not in common use when the book was written. The tremendous work done by Brian Chan, Phil Rowley, and others on understanding and imitating chronomids has been of great benefit to flyfishers. This information also post-dates the publication of the book and would be welcome in a new edition.Hughes is a good writer and the many tips he gives on finding trout are as valid today as when he wrote them.

Tight lines."},{"Title":"Strategies for Stillwater","review":"This is the author's advice on going after trout in lakes and ponds. He notes, \\"It might seem that the need for protection from predators couldn't mean much when it comes to reading water and finding fish in lakes. But it becomes very important once you recall that you're the predator. You have to get past a trout's defenses before you can coax it to the fly and feel its weight dangling pleasantly in your landing net\\".Catching trout is tough, regardless of the circumstances. Even though they may have pea-sized brains, they're wired for survival, and the fisherman has necessarily ceded the home field advantage to the fish. But in streams, the locations where they may be lurking can be easily spotted, water depth can be discerned, and the speed of the current requires the trout to make a fast decision to bite or not to bite. Furthermore, fish \\"hold\\" in preferred locations - you can go back to them again and again.None of this applies to fishing stillwaters. Think about it; in an expansive lake or pond of uncertain depth the trout can move around at will. They can be here today, and gone tomorrow. They have all the time they want to study our carefully tied flies and detect any deficiency in form or presentation prior to pouncing. And they'll use all their innate cleverness to full advantage in their effort to foil the fisherman.Hence the need for Strategies for Stillwater.Dave Hughes, perhaps my favorite fishing author, delivers a science that sets up the challenge: intellect versus instinct. Armed with the information in this book, the angler can level the playing field in a contest that otherwise affords full advantage to the other contestant.The book opens with a discussion of trout behavior along with a study of the structure of stillwaters and the effects of plant life. From here we go on to learn about necessary gear and means of getting around lakes and ponds, and basic approaches using dry flies, nymphs, wet flies and streamers. Hughes then goes into detail on the most important food forms in lakes and how to imitate them.I still only catch one trout in a lake or pond for every ten in a stream, but without this book my average would be even worse."},{"Title":"Strategies for Stillwater","review":"This book has many wonderful pictures of trout in their natural habitats.

Most of us learned early in life that Robert Fulton invented the first steam-powered boat, just as we were also told in school that Thomas Edison invented almost everything else, including the light bulb. In fact, James Rumsey and John Fitch competed strenuously to be the first to launch a steam-powered boat. During the summer of 1790, Fitch launched a steamboat commuter service between Philadelphia and Trenton but was unable to make it profitable in competition with stagecoaches. It was not until almost 20 years later (1807) that Fulton's Clermont carried passengers between New York City and Albany.The need for water transportation was obvious, hence the importance of barges but they could not proceed against the current and had to be towed back or returned over land for their next voyage. What if the power of steam could be used to solve that problem? Of course, those whose economic self-interests would be threatened by (in effect) a steam-powered barge -- notably owners and employees of stagecoach and barge companies -- did all they could to oppose efforts by Rumsey and Fitch. They delayed but could not ultimately deny what proved to be the inevitable commercial success of steam-powered boats, \\"America's first great invention.\\"Sutcliffe's writing skills are such that her presentation of historical material reads like a novel worthy of Charles Dickens in his prime. Her narrative has everything: passionate and determined antagonists, a plot filled with crisis and conflict, conspiracies, use and abuse of political influence as well as all manner of anecdotes which help to reveal the stresses, tensions, and (yes) opportunities which developed during the years immediately following the American Revolution.Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention","review":"When Isaac Newton was being congratulated for his schentific achievements he said, \\"If I have accomplished anything it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants who went before me.\\"When Robert Fulton produced a steam boat he took all the credit and got away with it. His achievements were great, but only because a bunch of inventors went before him. He too stood on the shoulders of giants, he just didn't admit it.Andrea Sutcliffe has done a good job here of pulling together the history of the development of steam powered vessels in the United States.She mentions that Henry Miller Shreve (after whom Shreveport, Louisiana was named) built some steam boats. I tend to say that the thing Robert Fulton built was really a steam ship, that is a deep draft vessel, suitable for use in deep rivers like you find in the Northeast. Shreve invented (along with some help of course) the typical Mississippi River Steamboat.This is probably not important, but when we think of the early boats, we tend to think of riverboats on the Mississippi not the early boats on the Hudson.Recommended book."},{"Title":"Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention","review":"In school, we learned to say \\"Robert Fulton\\" whenever we were asked to name the inventor of the steamship. Alas, not only is that answer wrong; but a correct one cannot be summed up by just one name, one year, or one event. Andrea Sutcliffe unravels the tangled web of men, machines, failures, successes, financial backers, patents and politics involved in getting steamships chugging on American rivers during the time period of 1784 to 1811. Here we learn about people like John Fitch and James Rumsey. We discover how George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were involved in the process. We read about boiler explosions, innumerable tinkerings and improvements, and proving \\"who had what idea when.\\" The newly-formed Patent Office plays a huge role in this drama. Robert Fulton doesn't even make an appearance until the last third of the book. Throughout it all, one has to wonder about the tenacity and sanity of the men who not only had to deal with the temperament of machines, but also with the skepticism of state and federal authorities. Imagine attempting to take a prototype steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers during the New Madrid earthquake of 1811! Why didn't we ever hear about these stories in school? As for Robert Fulton: \\"As Fulton freely admitted, he never really invented the steamboat. Rather, he built the first steamboat that really worked.\\" (p. 180) And he comes off as a dandy and an opportunist in this book.You might scoff and ask, \\"How interesting can the history of the steamboat be?\\" Read this book and find out. The miracle is that this invention ever came to fruition."},{"Title":"Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention","review":"\\"Steam\\" captures the intrigue of the chase for steam-powered transportation. And there was no shortage of intrigue and industrial espionage when it came to building the first American steamboat. Ms. Sutcliffe also develops the novelty of steam power in the 18th century and what a radical departure the steam engine was compared to water power.The story of the steam engine also involves politics. Inventors sought patents in order to make claims for navigation monopolies. The inventors knew that inventing a steam boat would not make them rich. However, a monopoly to operate a steamboat on a particular river would be their path to wealth. (The story of Robert Fulton.)Ms. Sutcliffe takes care to present a balanced storyline. In most histories of the steamboat, the authors tended to be partial to a particular inventor. This is not the case with this work.\\"Steam\\" is an American story, but it also is a global story with James Watt's steam engine setting the standard for the era. America had to invent a steam engine because Great Britain guarded the technology and export licenses of the Watt engine.I found it quite remarkable that inventors James Rumsey and John Fitch built operational steamboats with almost no information to go on. And certainly, they had no working model (like Watt's engine) to copy. These boats were built a full decade before Eli Whitney introduced the concept of machined, interchangeable parts.Ms. Sutcliffe has done her readers a favor by presenting her work as a chapter of American history rather than as a technology primer. The age of steam in America begins just after the end of the Revolutionary War. We find a fledgling American nation still joined at the hip with Great Britain. And we see the battle between states and the federal government for power to issue patents and navigation franchises.The story of the steamboat makes for a good barometer of the first four decades of American history."},{"Title":"Praying the Bible for Your Life","review":"It just helps to have God's word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on.

For anyone who has sat though a high school government class, it presents nothing new-the authors mechanically highlighted the historical realities and background surrounding America's founding. More disturbingly, however, the authors chose to corruptly use their editorial voice, broadly tossing anyone who disagree into the \\"Religious Right\\" camp and irresponsibly attributing to them words such as moron, shameless, and junkies. Absurd generalizations and vicious attacks are not signs of good, or even authentic, scholarship. I would have to submit that they had wasted their time, and certainly mine.The book starts out by asking the question \\"is America a Christian nation\\" without exploring the various meanings and implications of the term Christian Nation. A Christian Nation may mean different things to different people; for some, it may denote a country who is governed by a Christian-theocratic apparatus, while for others, it may simply describe a nation whose culture and character are not-so-lightly flavored by Christian symbols and languages. The question they brought before the audience here is essentially a loaded one because the authors had already presupposed a conclusion before they began the erudite process of genuine inquiry. It is their position that they \\"will be happy when religion has the same rights in the public sphere as General Motors, no more and no less.\\" The \\"proper role\\" of religion, then, is essentially a private enterprise not unlike that of GM. This sentiment produces a couple of interesting ramifications. First, to assign a role to religion vis-&agrave;-vis political life (or in their term, the public sphere) demonstrates a lack of understanding regarding what religion fundamentally means. Religion, by definition, stands for what is of the \\"ultimate importance.\\" This entails a comprehensive claim to one's life in scope and superlative claim to one's loyalty in degree. With these demands, religious life necessarily comes prior to political life and, indeed, to one's participation in the public sphere. Occupations, status, and membership in various groups are but different roles that one plays in the confines of religious life. To speak of religion in terms of its role vis-&agrave;-vis some greater whole is to flip flop this proper relationship that I have shown here and would, therefore, be incongruous. Secondly, General Motors is commonly perceived to be a pillar, an icon, of American capitalism. With annual revenue of 167 billion dollars, it ranks second among Fortune Magazine's list of 500 largest corporations in this country. It is interesting that the authors chose to ascribe the same degree of status (and implicitly prestige) as religion to this corporate giant. Consciously or not on their part, this confirms the thesis that I have been attempting to advance for the past years that capitalism has, indeed, achieved a sort of religio-paradigmatic claim on our lives not unlike Christianity had generations before. Contemporary capitalism has essentially trumped Christianity to become the dominant religion of our time; ultimately, it is financial considerations that determine the directions that we take and drive (pun intended) the choices that we make, not the notions of virtue, not the notions of the good, and certainly not the notions of sacrificial love.After an introduction by way of the posing of what I would consider a loaded question, the book embarks on discussing the standard Woodian curriculum concerning church-state separation and its American heritage. This discussion was not conducted in any systematic way, nor was any attempt made by the authors to chronologically or ideologically organizes the various topics. Their thematic treatment seem arbitrary at times with no coherence among the different sections being discussed. It seemed as if this part of the book was secondary on their agenda and was only hastily put together to fill pages. The first matter that the book highlighted was the secular countenance of the United States Constitution. The authors were correct in noting that the constitution does not invoke God's providence and that the inclusion and discussions surrounding the Pinckney provision of \\"no religious test\\" were evidences for the founders' attempt at religious neutrality. They were also correct in identifying the non-doctrinaire religion of deism and the intellectual rigor of the enlightenment as indispensable and powerful forces among many of the legislative elite. But what the authors fail to mention, and this failure imparts the impression that the dawn of the republic was marked by blatant irreligiousness, was the fact that religious voices were by no means extinct during the founding. In Washington's farewell address, for example, he counseled that the new constitution was written, and would only work, for a religious people. Patrick Henry (mentioned later in unrelated circumstances), who went so far as to propose a bill to levy tax, which would support all Christian churches, may also serve as an example. Let me make clear that I am not suggesting the founding was the result of religious intents like the evangelicals' revisionist history would have us believe. What I am proposing is for these academics to make an effort in presenting all sides of the story and provide a more balanced, responsible accounts of historical episodes."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"Isaac Kramnick and R. Laurence Moore set out in 1996 to defend the American principle of church-state relations, which they take to mean a rather strict view of church-state separation. Tracing the principle from Roger Williams and John Locke through the founders to recent times, they argue that the Christian right misrepresents the Constitution and the First Amendment.Certainly a corrective to some of the rhetoric of the religious right is warranted. One occasionally hears the claim that the Constitution is a \\"Christian document,\\" that the founders were all devout Christians, and that America was founded as a \\"Christian nation.\\"As our authors point out, at the time of the Constitution most states had established churches and religious tests for office. The Constitution, by outlawing religious tests for federal offices and omitting references to God as a source of authority was a definite break from practice. For this reason, many opponents of the Constitution labeled it a \\"godless\\" document. And far from being uniformly orthodox, many (although certainly not all) of the founders were hostile to traditional (that is Trinitarian) Christianity.There are two problems with this work, one methodological and the other factual. By its own terms, the First Amendment applies only to the federal government. (An attempt by Madison to make it binding on the states failed.) It wasn't until the twentieth century that the Supreme Court held that the fourteenth amendment applied the Bill of Rights to the states. That being the case, it is likely that part of the goal of the Constitution was to leave religion where it existed - with the states.That leads to my second complaint: a failure to discuss any evidence that is contrary to our authors' thesis. Their discussion of Thomas Jefferson is typical. Our authors dutifully tell us that he didn't proclaim days of prayer or thanksgiving as president. Yet they don't tell us that as governor of Virginia he proclaimed a day of prayer in 1779. Even as president, Jefferson attended church services at the House of Representatives, and signed a law providing for a missionary and a church to the Kaskaskia Indians. Nor do they tell us that in his second inaugural address he stated that:\\"In matters of religion, I have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general [federal] government. I have therefore undertaken, on no occasion, to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it; but have left them, as the constitution found them, under the direction and discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies.\\"Since Jefferson said something similar in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, his view of church-state relations was consistent with his federalism. If there is any evidence that Jefferson would have supported federal court involvement in state matters such as prayer in school or the posting of the Ten Commandments, our authors don't seem to have it. (And the same goes for attempts to use the federal court to prevent the teaching of \\"secular humanism\\" in the public schools.)The discussion of James Madison illustrates the problem in reverse. Madison was always running into problems with Congress over church-state issues. Congress thought that paid chaplains, religious charters and federal aid to churches were permissible under the First Amendment, much to Madison's consternation. It doesn't occur to our authors that perhaps most people at the time didn't consider the Constitution so godless after all. This makes me wonder if the authors' failure to mention the Blaine Amendment (which sought to forbid state aid to religion) was just an oversight. While our authors have a fascinating discussion of an attempt to amend the Constitution to declare America a Christian nation, that the Blaine amendment failed (after the ratification of the fourteenth amendment no less) isn't worthy of mention. One can interpret this failure in various ways, but at least some who voted for the amendment apparently believed that it was necessary to amend the Constitution to make it sufficiently \\"godless.\\"I have no complaint with authors who write popular books, but this book's failure to include footnotes or discuss responsible authors who take an opposing approach is particularly striking. While our authors take on deep thinkers such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, nowhere do they interact with scholars who have challenged the separationist line, such as Robert Cord and Daniel Driesbach, or have a more sympathetic role of the influence of Christianity on the founders such as Ellis Sandoz.Even a cursory review of history shows the benefits of the separation of church and state. Defending the principle by one-sided scholarship does no one any good."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"Currently, we don't have an informed discussion of the wall of separation between religion and politics, between faith and law, in the media. Instead, we have shouting matches free of information that might help end some of the disputes.Karmnick and Moore set out to provide a brief, readable primer on (1) what the Framers had in mind when they separated Church and State, (2) what thinkers or events informed their conclusions, and (3) what relevance all of this has to the current debates on school prayer, tax-exempt status for churches, and other issues.Their argument is hard to argue with. The &quot;no religious test for public office&quot; clause (and the debate it generated) in the Constitution is their starting point for understanding what Madison, Jefferson, and others had on their minds when they wrote the core documents of American politics, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And there's a lot more critical background they discuss, such the Lockean view of the secular social contract between citizens and the government they create, and the religious arguments by people like Roger Williams and others in the 17th and 18th centuries against intermingling politics and religion. It's pretty clear what the Framers had in mind, and it was to keep religion and politics separate to the advantage of both.By the way, Steven Tooley's rebuttals here on Amazon are completely disingenuous and hit not the core of the book's arguments, but peripheral matters. He misunderstands Locke, a man of profound faith who also felt that government was not sanctioned by God, but created by human beings to serve very specific purposes. And for a guy who complains about &quot;ad homein&quot; [sic] attacks, Tooley doesn't hesitate to make comments like, &quot;Are these two professors trying to pull the wool over everyone eyes for a reason, or have they themselves been brainwashed?&quot; Read the book (which contains a lot of quotes from primary sources, by the way) and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"&quot;The founding fathers established the Constitution, and over 94 percent of it is directly from the Bible.&quot; Those are the words of Lee Behnken, an active promoter of PSCA, an organization dedicated to putting chaplains in our public schools. Evangelicals like Behnken often make such statements, and in doing so show their abysmal knowledge of the Constitution and those who developed it.There actually is no mention of God in the Constitution, and the only reference it makes to religion is in article 6 where it states that there shall be no religious test for political office. A current tragedy is that religious conservatives have, indeed, established informal religious tests of office through their &quot;voting guides&quot;.In developing the constitution men like Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison were strongly influenced by the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke who believed that the function of Government was solely to keep the peace. While religious enthusiasts like to point out the section of the Declaration of Independence that states that our &quot;Creator&quot; endowed us with certain unalienable rights, they seem unable to thoroughly assess the meaning of the following words that state these rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are secular attributes of government, i.e. that the state should protect us, and our property, and keep us free. And that is exactly the role envisioned by our Founders. Government should not promote religious laws that place restriction on our basic freedoms. Government should not decide moral issues.Jefferson and the others felt that when religion was involved in government it corrupted government and degraded religion. He felt it absurd that politicians should be the interpreters of the will of God. God, said Jefferson, needs no government officials to speak for Him.Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison did not want religion mixed with politics, and this book provides us with an excellent exposition of their views. Many Christians were very upset with the &quot;godless constitution&quot; and founded various organizations that from 1863 to 1945 fought for an amendment that would provide a statement in the preamble &quot;acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all authority and power in civil government..&quot;.

Let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone wanting to understand the relationship between government and religion leading up to, and just after ratification of our Constitution. Over the past several years there has been a plethora of books published that have tried to distort that relationship for current political gain. Consider this a partial \\"corrective action\\" to what is essentially propaganda from some authors with no scholarly credentials.As much as I enjoyed reading this book however, there are several concerns that I have regarding this book that doesn't make this the \\"end-all\\" regarding the debate about the role our founding fathers had in mind regarding religion. First, the authors leadoff with a chapter that sets the stage for \\"why this book at this time\\". Unfortunately this is not a good start for these authors writing this particular book. The authors are near perfect in their ability to provide a true picture of our actual history in the middle chapters, but as analysts, the authors get into taking sides politically prior to making their case. I would have preferred saving the analysis for the end, besides, the history is the most fascinating aspect of the book.In addition many people who need to receive this message, i.e., the religious right who have been fed propaganda by religious leaders like Dobson, Kennedy, and Robertson, could be put off by what they may sense is doctrine opposite, and thus negatively provocative, of what they believe is our true heritage. It would be a shame for these people to dismiss the book after the first chapter when this book would be more helpful to them than any other category of reader.What I did like about the book was the discussion about where the idea for a secular government came from, Locke, Williams, Paine, and how the framers developed those philosophies into our current Constitution. While riveting, this discussion is not complete. Another aspect I enjoyed was rather than just going into what our framers' intentions were regarding the creation of a secular government, the authors also discussed the documentation and verbal debates of the framers' opponents that promoted a non-secular government. This makes it self-evident that there were sides to this debate back then and who was on which side and those on the side of secularism were clearly the framers, contrary to what some current day propagandists would have you believe.The authors did an especially fine job of portraying the motivation for many devout Christians to create a secular government. The book features Roger Williams, an extremely devout Christian, who supported a secular government to \\"free churches from the designs of political men\\". In fact, there is a nice trail that leads from Williams in the 17th Century, to ratification of the Constitution, to the success of Baptists in building a base of members by forcing religion to gain members based on the \\"marketplace if ideas\\" rather than government support - exactly what Jefferson and Madison intended. The authors provide sufficient history to show how the \\"evangelicals\\" and Catholics of that day were for the most part strong secularists because they didn't have any political power, but now that these two groups currently compose a significant minority are pushing for the opposite - government power that endorses their belief system, an irony not lost on the authors.Another fine feature is the authors did not depend on quotes by design, which are often used by ideologues on both sides to distort the true history of our founding, instead they discuss political battles and who sided with whom. Particularly interesting was President Madison vetoing \\"faith based charities\\" for his denomination of Episcopalians, the most potent political group among Christians of that time. Another great analogy was the fight to stop the movement of mail on Sunday during a time when the Postal Service was much more important to greasing the skids of the market than it is today. And still more evidence, the fight to change the Constitution's preamble so \\"We the People\\" didn't sanction and empower our government, but rather that our government derive its power from God and Jesus Christ ,with Their attributes defined by the government, much like the European theocracies that caused so much suffering through the Dark and Middle Ages.What I would have hoped for from the authors was that they footnoted. While they do provide a great bibliography at the end and also discuss their reasons for not footnoting, I don't think one little book is going to dissuade zealots from clinging to lies, footnotes in today's world are imperative. While I absolutely trust the integrity of the authors, we have an abundance of people publishing distorted tracts that makes it imperative we require all authors to footnote (see Dobson, Robertson, and Kennedy for three examples).I also would have preferred a more robust defense of our religious history. The authors are great writers, entertaining, engaging, and yet even-handed. At 177 pages, there was plenty of room to go into more detail regarding Madison, Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton source material; thus providing additional evidence along with their opponents for a more full-fledged portrayal that these men did in fact purposefully set out, and in fact succeeded, to create a secular government and a society where religion could blossom, or whither, based on merit rather than government power."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"Of the half dozen books I've read recently on the subject of separation of church and state, this one presents and documents most clearly the historical facts. It also most cogently persuades the reader that the the Founding Fathers did not intend for the United States to be a \\"Christian Nation,\\" but rather to be a nation where all people are free to exercise their own individual conscience in favor of any religion of their choice, or no religion at all. The authors carefully document what the Fathers wrote on the subject of church and state at the time the Constitution was being adopted, and in the years immediately following. They also quote from numerous individuals during the first hundred years following adoption showing how they complained bitterly that God had been left out of the Constituion and that the God was not pleased with our country because our Constitution was indifferent to Christianity. They then point out the irony that this argument has been turned on its head today by Christian leaders, such as Pat Robertson, and others who assert that we were founded as a \\"Christian Nation\\" with God always present in the Constitution until liberal judges began misinterpreting the Consitution to remove God. As a rather conservative Christian myself, I highly recommend this book to other conservatives to gain a perspective, as explained by the authors, that the creation of a godless constitution was not an act of irreverence but was an act of confidence in religion. By keeping religion out of government, the Founding Fathers fostered a beautiful system of voluntary religious affiliation and service that has so benefited our country -- protecting religion from the whims and corrupting influences of government, and likewise allowing government to do what it does best in governing people of many different religions or no religion at all.

Rather, it is an excellent primer for the general public on the one most controversial aspect of the Constitution, the absence of any mention of God, and the near-absence of mention of religion.Religion is mentioned only in Article 6, which forbids any religious test for any public office, and in Amendment 1, which forbids Congress to make any law for the establishment (government support, a now-archaic meaning of 'establishment') of any religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.Despite the fierce opposition of many who objected to the 'godlessness' of the Constitution, it managed to get ratified. Shortly thereafter, a treaty with Tripoli declared in so many words that the United States is in no way a Christian nation. For more than a hundred years thereafter, there were repeated attempts to amend the Constitution to add a reference to God and/or to declare this a Christian nation, all of which failed. During the latter part of the twentieth century, the Fundamentalists and the commercial purveyors of \\"Christianity\\" changed their tune, insisting now that United States was originally a Christian nation (despite the clear evidence to the contrary), and that the Judiciary is to blame for misinterpreting the Constitution, e.g. by declaring government-sponsored prayer in schools unconstitutional. It is claimed that this is keeping God out of the public schools.It is unclear how an all-powerful God has become so weak that He can be forced out of someplace He wants to be (e.g. public schools) or kept against His will where He doesn't want to be. It is equally unclear why God is assumed to want to be out of America. (slogan: Keep God in America!)Some, who apparently didn't read as far as page 179, have complained about the lack of footnotes, despite the explanation given by the authors that the book is intended for the general reader, not the serious academic.

The main claim of their book is that religion has no place in government, specifically the Constitution. Kramnick and Moore state that the framers of the Constitution felt that government and religion should not mingle. The authors claim that the framers were not anti-religious, just anti religious-government. Kramnick and Moore reinforce their argument with historical problems and figures that stem from the time-honored debate over secularism in America . Their main opponents to this argument are the religious right, say the authors. They are the group of religious activists trying to reinstall what they claim is the Christian ethic in American government. Kramnick and Moore lay down three major examples as to why the American government should remain staunchly secular: the case of Roger Williams, the Jefferson ideal, and the Sunday mail.Authors Kramnick and Moore deliberate the core of their argument through Roger Williams, an early 17th century minister in Salem Massachusetts . While he was obviously Christian, say Kramnick and Moore, he was a staunch proponent of separation of church and state. Williams' argument was based in historical fact, say the authors. He cited the historical legacies of the Roman Catholic church and the Church of England. Williams claimed that these churches held a strangle-hold over the counties they served. They corrupted government policy by allowing theology to dictate matters of state. These churches felt that religion is the only way to govern a country. According to Williams, government need not be associated with God or religion at all to be successful. Williams takes note that many successful societies have been led by non-religious leaders, and non-Christian at that (Nebuchadnezzar, Hammurabi, Solon, Pericles, Julius Caesar, and Augustus Caesar). Successful leaders could be found among Jews, Turks or Chinese, says Williams.His argument is not all inclusive, however. Kramnick and Moore note that if a non-Christian running for office were to spout blatant blasphemies as part of his campaign, he would not be considered a \\"wise\\" leader by Williams. Although such a leader could indeed be a wise leader, being so anti-religious would automatically condemn him even to a Christian secularist such as Williams. Despite his efforts to secularize America , the argument against religious government continued well on into the late 18th century, say Kramnick and Moore. Thomas Jefferson was the next major player in this fight for true secularization.Thomas Jefferson, one of the key framers of the US Constitution, was widely attacked for his devotion to secularization, say Kramnick and Moore. He, like Williams, vigorously supported the notion of a godless Constitution. Although drawing his argument more from Locke than from Williams, say the authors, Jefferson faced the most brutal attacks on his beliefs. He was labeled the most vile of \\"infidels\\", \\"agnostics\\" and other godless creatures. Jefferson was in fact a devote Christian. He even assemble a \\"Jesus Bible\\" containing the teachings of Christ along with Jefferson 's own interpretations scribbled in the margins. It was Jefferson 's conviction, state Kramnick and Moore, that man's mind, and thus his religion, should be the most free and private affair. Like freedom of property or speech, religious beliefs should be absolutely distinct from any form of governmental policy. Kramnick and Moore also note that Jefferson , like Locke before him, firmly believed that even the slightest involvement or support of religion in government was a direct path to the tyranny of older societies. Like Williams as well, Jefferson feared a return to Roman Catholic or English theological domination over government. The mind of man was his own, and therefore his religion was his own. To legislate any notions of religion violated that freedom of the mind and would ultimately lead to tyranny, say Kramnick and Moore. Today, carved upon Jefferson 's memorial in Washington DC is a quote by Jefferson that sums up his conviction, \\"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\\"The next great debate over separation of church and state, say Kramnick and Moore, came from the question of delivering mail on the Sabbath. In 1809, Postmaster Hugh Wylie was expelled from church because he delivered mail on the Sabbath. After repealing the issue with the US government, say Kramnick and Moore, the issue of mail delivery was deemed too important to be squelched; mail would be delivered due to its vital role in the country's economy. This ignited a 20 year war over the government's role in the religious observance of the Sabbath, claim Kramnick and Moore. The argument for mail delivery likened itself to that of the trains and telegraph. If trains and telegraph operations were to cease on Sunday, then the economy would surely fall, says Kramnick and Moore, and thus would be the same for mail delivery. Despite heated debate over the issue for almost a century, the issue was finally settled with Congress closing all post offices on Sunday by 1912. Most post offices had already been dwindling off, say Kramnick and Moore, since after the Civil War. But the final act of no delivery on the Sabbath was a blow to the Constitution, claim the authors.Regardless of these minor infringements on the US Constitution, say Kramnick and Moore, it has survived wholly as they claim it should: Godless. The controversy of religion in government has continually sparked healthy debate over church and state separation and has constantly reminded the public that it is hardly a sealed issue. Kramnick and Moore, although unabashedly biased, have laid out a good argument against religious correctness in American politics. While often using \\"mudslinging\\" tactics to achieve their goals, they make the case that absolute secularization is at least more successful in government policy than the opposite. With the use of Roger Williams' and Thomas Jefferson's ideals over secularization, Kramnick and Moore leave a lasting mark on the virtues of a Godless Constitution."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"Let me be the first reviewer since 9/11 to weigh in on this valuable book.

All explained in this simple and scholarly book."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"This book attempts to totally dispute the reason this country was founded. And the two professors who didn't feel the need for footnotes and bibliographies had a reason for this - other than their personal opinions, founded by their liberal and atheistic thoughts, the true history of this country is one founded by highly religious Puritans who came here looking for freedom of worship apart from a theocracy in England. They founded a country based on God and His Son, Jesus Christ, and there is overwhelming proof that they intended it to be ruled by the morality of the Bible and the Ten Commandments.That continued through the years between the Pilgrim voyage and the Founding Fathers. ANd to totally contradict these professors, our Founders (some - very few - of them deists and some of them agnostics) established Christianity as the official religion of this nation for a reason: that there could be no morality, no honesty, no respectability, without a set of laws, and the Bible and Christianity provided those laws. Congress printed Bibles and made sure that they were made available to the people, families and churches. The \\"non-Christians\\" among them deferred to the Bible because they knew the power and the necessity of the faith.These two men can rail all they want about a godless Constitution, but there is overwhelming proof that our country was founded by Christians as a Christian country, and that since we have removed God and Jesus from the country, it has foundered massively. Without rule of law, there is no truth, no morality, and we can see the results. And the fact that these men failed to supply their readers with footnotes proves that this book is the musings of two men who have decided that their opinions (and they are ONLY opinions) are the only ones that matter, and that any opposing thought is needless.The book is interesting reading to see where these liberal godless people are coming from, but it will not sway anyone who is rooted in their faith."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"Excellent book. For anybody who has been brainwashed into believing that this country was founded as a &quot;Christian Nation&quot;, this book will set the record straight."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"The most important argument in this book might be the purely historical one that until very recently in American history, everyone on each side of the issue of whether the U.S. Constitution should contain a religious or Christian element understood that the constitution as we have it was \\"a Godless constitution.\\" Those who felt the constitution should honor God or who felt that the United States should be recognized in some fashion as the foundation of the nation were scandalized that the constitution contained no references to God or the Divine. For nearly two hundred years the effort on the part of evangelicals was to try to get God into the constitution. But under wildly revisionist reinterpretations by folks like Pat Robertson the assumption is that God was in the constitution from the beginning, and that they are merely trying to regain the focus on God that the Founders had when they wrote the constitution. As Kramnick and Moore demonstrate in this excellent brief study, any such view is fantastical nonsense.Early chapters in the book examine the beliefs concerning the relationship between government and a divine foundation found in the Puritans, and why Roger Williams and subsequently the Founders wanted to create a wall of separation between a secular government and organized religion. They show how Williams desired the separation not for the sake of government, but for the sake of religion, for the distortive and corrupting influence political leaders can exert when they attempt to employ religion to bolster political causes. Also, if religion and political parties are too closely identified, if the party falls into disrepute, so also can religion through association. This latter point is far too often forgotten today, and the close identification of the Religion Right with today's extreme right of the GOP does not portend well for evangelicalism. History shows that political sympathies tend to be like a swinging pendulum, and when the pendulum swings the other direction away from the right wing extremism that has colored American politics for the past thirty years (making even a moderate conservative like Bill Clinton appear to many to be a liberal), organized religion could suffer in the reaction. Williams understood this; today's evangelicals do not.But whatever Williams's motives in desiring a secular government, Jefferson, Adams, Washington, Madison, Franklin, and the rest of the Founders desired equally a wall of separation because such was best for both the sake of government and religion. Jefferson envisioned a government that was as little involved in the consciences of individuals as possible. While he believed that religion should play a life in America, it had no place whatsoever in government. In this all the major founders were in complete agreement.The final section of the book deals with the history of the Sunday mails controversy, and is important because it carefully documents the ongoing understanding of all Americans throughout the 19th and virtually all of the 20th centuries that the American constitution was a thoroughly secular document, with no Christian or religious element whatsoever. This is crucial because recently many members of the religious right have attempted to reinterpret history and counterfactually assert that they want to reassert the religious elements that have already been there. Unless people are familiar with the actual historical facts, such revisionism might actually influence the ill informed.This is a very solid history, one that is very much in the spirit of Roger Williams in wanting to promote a strong religious life, but understanding that this is only possible with a completely secular government that cannot be employed to exploit religious bodies for its use, as the political right is exploiting the religious right today. I would also like to recommend that anyone reading this book also consult the superb book by Frank Lambert, THE FOUNDING FATHERS AND THE PLACE OF RELIGION IN AMERICA. Compatible with the Kramnick and Moore study, Lambert's book focuses on the shift from theistically based colonies favored by the original settlers to completely secular governments instituted by the Founders."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up.

Together these books are essential reading for anyone who wants to stop the errosion of the consitutional separation of church and state and to preserve religious freedom in the U.S."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"A very enjoyable and informative book.The authors clearly spell out the Jeffersonian tradition of religious liberty in the United States.They point out how the complete separation of religion and the state has contributed to our religious diversity and lack of bloody conflict.They expose the attempt by the Religious Right to establish a&quot;christian nation&quot; in the U.S. in the 19th century,and the defeat of their measures. It also shows how the current Religious Right distorts America's history to suit their own agenda.A thouroghly enjoyable and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"This book presents a well presented argument for the clear seperation of church and state in America. It draws from history, and touches upon some key moments in the development of our Constitution and the history and ideas that went into creating this purely secular document. This is presented against a backdrop that highlights the framers of the constitution and what they were intending.This is a pretty unbiased book in the sense that it does not get into the debate over the value or truth of religion, only how it fits in to the American government through the Constitution.In a day and age where most people's concept of history comes from the mouths of demagogues instead of from the truth, this book provides an enlightened perspective on a very important social issue.One thing also you learn from this book - there is nothing being said today by the forces trying to make our country into a theocracy that hasn't been said before."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"It's a good book, and has a lot of interesting points. I believe the thesis statement(the Constitution of the US, is, for better or for worse, a paper that makes no mention of God and leaves God out of the state); however, this disturbs me.First off, one of the guys that really influenced the Founding Fathers of the US is a guy called John Locke(yes, LOST fans, I think I know where they got the name from. Haha!) Anyways, he had some good ideas, but I think he went too far in his theories and didn't take a moment to think what the full extent of those theories would have led to. Basically, he wanted a Godless State, because he had seen what a Godful (Umm, what is the opposite of Godless? ')State had done to Europe... the dozens of DREADFUL wars of religion (a really nice and bloody one was the Dutch war for Independence...) and so he came to the conclusion that religion + the state = bad. Now, I think I understand him, and I agree with him on one level, but at another level, I disagree with him. Here's why:I think that Locke has a lot of good ideas. I also understand how he came to his radical ideas seeing what the state of Europe was at the time. BUT I disagree with his statements. I believe that when the government is made completely godless, as Locke seems to want it, then the nation itself will become godless. I'm not sure if Locke wanted this, or didn't think this would happen (I'm sure for a person living in his time the idea of no religion was impossible to comprehend). And so, we have a problem. To this day, the best morals come from holy texts and their religions. All of the religions I have experienced (Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam) at some point or another encourage morals. Yes, many of them are, to me, immoral (like Islamic laws dealing with women) but they are there, at some point or another. And so, when we create a secular state, it is necessary to have laws; a state without laws is pointless! And yet, if we do, indeed, create a truly \\"godless\\" state then where do our laws come from? Even if we base them off of what the Enlightenment people of the age called \\"natural law\\" we are still using Deism, a religion! I find that when we remove God and religion from the state, for better or for worse, then we remove any and all reason to obey the state and its law other than the fact that the state is bigger, stronger and smarter than you. In short, you have created the greatest monster one can imagine, a demon of supreme power who forces you to do his bidding, not because he is right, but because he has become your god.I think this is what has/is happened/ing in the West. We have replaced the religion of Christianity with others; Islam is becoming popular (one of the fastest growing religions in the world!) and then we have Atheism and Science, which contain either no morals (Atheism gives me no morals other than the ones that I myself choose. Hmm...not good? Same with Science, really) and Islam, well, I've already explained my view of Islam. When we remove God from the government, we are admitting that God has no place in the public sector, and thus whatever rules or morals God has given us are pointless and irrelevant! THIS IS A LIE OF SATAN!Yep, that's what I say: at the base of Locke's theory, we end up with the worst type of state imaginable: Communism! (Yes, I believe Communism is evil...hard not to consider what Mao, Lenin, and Stalin did!)However, this gives us a problem: How do we combine religion with politics, which, as I've said, don't mix: wars of religion anyone? Jihad? The Crusades? With a nation that has a good set of morals..."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"This is a well researched and insightful book that it is a highly recommended read. I was in the middle of an e-mail debate and my adversary brought forth \\"evidence\\" citing excerpts from the Declaration of Independence as the basis of the establishment of \\"A Christian Nation\\". Moore and Kramnick completely dispel this myth. They take a scholarly and historical approach, supported by hard data, to suppress the nonsense put forth by religious fundamentalists that we are a faith based government and that we always have been. The book examines the rationale that hardliners use to currently deny our secular form of state and it counters the tired rants that our dear Christian nation is under constant attack by atheist, liberal and progressive forces. My interpetations after the read are that this is currently evidenced by modern theocrats using a manipulative strategy of misinterpretation of quotes, denial of evidenced truths and the rewriting of historical facts to promote their contemporary agenda. Turns out to be quite the opposite historically and the book cites how the hard line clergy have recently reversed tactics due to previous failures. The publication informs the reader and backed by testimony, that for the first 150 years or so of our nation, the theocrats were displeased with our secular Constitution and were determined to \\"Christianize\\" it. The authors intelligently counter the allegation that the nation was theocratic in origin and that Christian spirituality was a major component in the foundation of the new federal republic. The authors lay down the facts convincingly of the type of nation that was envisioned as by our founding fathers country and the role that religion was going to play in the new democracy. It examines the early contentious debates at the time the Constitution was ratified, of the discourse that followed shortly thereafter and the subsequent attempts by fundamentalist clergy to amend our sacred document of law, \\"The Godless Constitution\\". Kramnick and Moore also point out the important parts that religion plays in a democratic society and the positive influences it contributes to the morality, politics and the well being of the modern nation-state."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"This book does a perfect job of demolishing the myth of the so-called religious foundings of our country, and it does so without resorting to attacks or political bias. In fact, I think the authors tended to lean to the right politically, but that is just opinion.The book, however is excellent and should be required reading for students in high school. Of course, that would probably violate the church/state separation that the Constitution protects. Interesting how the First Amendment that the Religious Right disdains actually protects them and their views. Pathetic."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"One of the most common misperceptions about the United States is that it is a Christian nation. It is not. It never was, nor was it ever intended to be. American citizens have been spoonfed a false nostalgia for a &quot;better time&quot; when religion, specifically, Christianity, was the &quot;center&quot; of our government and home life: that has been the propaganda of &quot;freedom of religion&quot;.Early settlers were a despotic lot, intolerant and stringent in their views. Modern-day evangelists would not have been welcome in New England. Quakers were hanged for their beliefs. There was little freedom of anything, let alone religion.This book gives a resounding answer to those who are fond of saying &quot;the phrase 'separation of church and state' doesn't appear anywhere in the Constitution&quot;. Well, neither does &quot;right to a fair and speedy trial&quot;, but it is part of the common lexicon and a sacred principle of our society.If you've ever wondered what the truth really is about the first amendment and the role of religion in the founding of the United States, this book is an excellent place to start your search."},{"Title":"The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness","review":"This is a difficult book to write a review about simply because one does not know where to start. The book was authored by two Cornell University professors and comes off as a scholarly critique, however upon closer examination you realize that it is nothing but a faade for factual errors. The lack of footnotes and the use of out of context quotes is farcical coming from two professors. They use many one or two word quotes such as these \\"discrimination\\" (38) \\"oppressive measure\\" (68) \\"infernal infamy\\" (103) \\"left wing\\" (112) \\"spiritual church\\" (122) and on it goes. Just what are you supposed to gain from the fact that the founders might have penned \\"oppressive measure\\". Another hurdle in reviewing this book is where do you start with all the inaccuracies. It is easy to point out factual errors but the authors of this book have done something ingenious in their writings. They have mixed factual inaccuracies with their editorial opinions giving the appearance to the reader that even the founding fathers agreed with THEIR thesis. So in reality all they have done is peppered their opinions with the 2 worded quotes attributed to the founding fathers, somehow conveying historicity to their opinions. While it does not take a genius to figure this out, all you need to do is read a few other reviews to find out just how many people were so easily brainwashed by this book.The book is also replete with ad homein attacks, arguments from silence and strawmen attacks. I personally did not expect this from two highly regarded professors and I think it shows some childishness. It would be easy to rip apart the factuality of the book if one had more space instead, I will just focus on their Chapter 4 where we are introduced to John Locke. The authors opine that \\"all important figures of the founding generation. . . . were disciples of Locke.\\" (72) and \\"Locke's convictions form in fact the foundation of the American political creed\\" (72) and \\"The Declaration of Independence reads like a paraphrase of Locke\\" (72). The authors further on in this chapter portray Locke as a atheist who believes \\"the church thus had no special or central place in the secular politics of the founders' liberalism\\" (77). And on it goes, but who is John Locke? Was he as prominent an author as portrayed? Moreover, was he anti-religion?First of all John Locke was born in 1632 and graduated Christ Church College with a masters degree in 1658. He wrote several books including Two Treatises of Government (1690), The Reasonableness of Christianity (1695) and A Vindication of the Reasonableness of Christianity (1697). It was these last two books that decimates the authors opinions that John Locke was not religious, in fact he was a Christian Apologist. However, it was his writing on Treatises of Government that the founding fathers drew the theory of social compact. It was also through these writings that they gained the insight of civil law being grounded in Natural Law. And Natural Law according to Locke is simply Divine (God Inspired) Law whose moral principals can be inferred by anyone. Because John Locke relied so heavily on the bible in developing his political theories it is not surprising to find that he cited the bible a total of 1,514 different times in his Two Treatises of Government; a small fact that the authors of this book omitted. Accordingly, if one were to give an example of Lockean thinking probably the quote \\"We are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. . . \\" would be the best example.The last point about John Locke is just how important was he? The Authors contend he was the most important author to the founding fathers but all we have to do is look at who was cited the most in the founding fathers writing. From 1760 - 1805 just who did the founding father quote the most?#1 THE BIBLE 34% of all quotes#2 Baron Charles Secondat de Montesquieu 8.3%#3 Sir William Blackstone 7.9%#4 John Locke 2.9%As you can see there was some disingenuous on the part of the authors to portray Mr. Locke as the most important scholar of the day. This simple critique of one chapter in the book shows you the inaccuracies that are portrayed repeatedly throughout the book. The bigger question is why do it? Are these two professors trying to pull the wool over everyone eyes for a reason, or have they themselves been brainwashed? By examining their sources that they used for their book we note something interesting. They have listed 27 books and not one of them was an original source document. The authors have culled all their information from current thinking, just look at this breakdown of when the books the authors cited were published:1999 - 1990 8 cites1989 - 1980 7 cites1979 - 1970 4 cites1969 - 1960 6 cites1959 - 1955 2 citesThe sad fact is this book is a compilation of modern day scholarship discussing what happened 200+ years ago. Not one original source document was cited so just how could the authors understand what the original intent of the founding fathers were without going back to original sources is beyond comprehension of any historian.This book should be avoided at all costs, go to your library and check out some books written by the founding father or by their contemporaries if you want a accurate picture of the history of this great country."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"I didn't like this book as much as the others.

But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first.

Maybe if they were not so gorgeous--really how many gorgeous people are there in the world who are &quot;perfect&quot; on top of that?

Not only was Gillian a weak, little mouse of a character, who didn't even see that her &quot;angel&quot; was a complete psychotic jerk when it was obvious, but she defined herself through what others thought of her. She couldn't be strong and stand up for herself until she was popular. In addition, her 'soulmate', David was a joke! In all other books, the Soulmate Principal is described as falling into each others minds, being able to see each others' very essences and being completely connected to them. However, the only reason David liked Gillian was because she suddenly dressed with a little more style and she got a new haircut.Right....very romantic...I can just here the sentimental music swelling in the background..The &quot;hero&quot; of the story's only motivation for loving the heroine is that she's hot. Great.Compared to the other books in the series like, &quot;Black Dawn&quot;, &quot;Soulmates&quot;, &quot;The Chosen&quot;, &quot;Witchlight&quot; and especially &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot; is a complete waste of your time."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"Good book but...David.Is.An.Idiot!!!Even after they got together I still felt like he was treating Gillian like a little sister and the guy just seemed like he had gotten his head knocked in with a football to many times.

He is no Ash, he is no Gabriel, heck, even Thea's guy (what's his name?) was more intriguing .

Okay sure, Gillian appears a little superficial at the start but then everyone is superficial, even if it's only a tad. Miss Smith makes the reader relate to Gillian though and as you get to know her you see that she isn't all that superficial, she just wants to fit in like every teenager.The plot was more four star but the characters were believeable, good and the dialoge and pace was great. Over all it was a four and a half star but you only have four or five so i stepped it up half a star."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"I really enjoyed this book and Gillian's story mostly because she's someone I can relate to.

Everyone says that it's stupid she wants to be popular but wouldn't you(unless you already are)? Everyone seems to hate David as well but I think he's a great guy.

Yeah I guess it wasn't totally Ms. Smith's normal book but I loved it. It was the first time we heard about the lost Harman babies which came into play in WhitchLight. Did anybody else notice that Gillian and Ilianna are like second cousins? Also the Night world was always there lurking in the background. Angel was the night world. The bad guy, the dark one.

It's a good book, as I said before, and a nice addition to the ever-growing tapestry of the Night World series. It has interesting characters, and a new Harman witch in it, which I think is really great. I also like how she puts Ash in there, too, so that you know he's still around.

I found this book (as a seperate entity) to be a very good book! Gillian is smart and a bit socially awkward. She doesn't think very much of herself at all, especially since no one at her school knows that she exists and her home life is crumbling. Angel is a compelling character, having hidden motives, unknown origins and witty dialogue. I can agree that David was less than superb... But he wasn't really the main focus of the book anyway! As the book progresses we see the developing of a bond between Angel and Gillian, an explanation for Gillian's home problems, an exploration of witchcraft, and an overall view of teenage life (which can really suck).Anyway, I found this to be a very enjoyable book that I kept coming back to in any free moment of my day."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"This book was kind of different from the other Night World series, but it was my absolute favorite. once i started reading, it was impossible to put down.

IT IS FREAKING AMAZING THOUGH.READ IT."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"For some reason, out of all the Night World Books, 'Dark Angel' always scores the lowest. For me, however, Dark Angel was one of the better books. Take Gillian for example. Sure she's not especially daring or a vampire hunter or an experienced martial artist, but that's what makes her special. She's US. She is the average teen girl, unsure of herself, with family problems, and complete with the crush on the popular guy. Sure, she longs to be popular, but that doesn't make her 'shallow' as most people like to put. Every one of us has longed for popularity in school. And if you say you 'didn't care about such things' then you are fooling yourself. What I liked best about this book is that we got to see the Night World from an outsider; Gillian knew nothing about it, all she had to go on was the snippets she heard here and there, mostly from Angel and from her own deduction. (as well as the witch character in the store) And yes, there wasn't as much action in Dark Angel as there was in say, 'Huntress' or 'The Chosen', but that doesn't make it bad. It was a relief for me to see a highschool student being NORMAL. Jez and Rashel (Jez especially) rather got on my nerves at times with their reckless behavior and their super-woman, over confident ways. It was nice to see a girl that was actually just a GIRL. It made me feel as though I wasn't under-achieved. The only reason I gave this book a '4' and not a '5' was because the ending seemed a little weak to me. As for the whole David/Angel thing, yes. I WAS voting for Angel and Gillian to get together..he had a certain charm to him that was absent from David. After seeing guys like Ash, Delos, and Quinn, David didn't quite measure up. Or maybe it was because he was just a normal human, not of the nightworld. He wasn't mysterious or powerful..just an average, teenage highschooler doing average, teenage things.Regardless, this book is an excellent addition to your L.J Smith Collection."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"Gillian Lennox is your typical high school outcast. She walks the halls hiding behind a curtain of hair, seeming so timid that people either don't notice her or, if they do, believe she's from the junior high.A near-death experience completely changes all of that. Gillian freezes to death but is stopped by an angel claiming it's not her time. Given the choice, Gillian decides to try life again--but this time she has a guardian angel at her side, guiding her. She cuts her hair, dresses to stand out, and erupts from the sidelines with a blazing confidence that wins over most of the school.Dark Angel is highly underrated, simply because the Night World isn't so deeply touched upon as it is in other books. What makes this so remarkable, however, is the exploration of \\"lost witches.\\" Lost witches (also known as \\"psychics\\" or \\"clairvoyants\\") were briefly touched upon in the first book, Secret Vampire. It's what a life-like experience WOULD be for a human girl, finding out bits and pieces of a terrifying and mystical world you were previously unaware of.Gillian is a strong character. She undergoes major emotional changes with the help of \\"Angel,\\" and in the end finds an inner strength she can hold on to and call her own.My biggest complaint would be David's characterization. Tanya, the forefront antagonist and his ex-girlfriend, attracted more attention than Gillian's love interest, and that is a little sad. L.J. Smith can certainly make strong antagonists and fascinating (if pacifist) males (as she did in Soulmate), but with David she fell a bit short. Nothing about David made me smile and think, \\"Yes, Gillian, he's worth it!\\"Other than that, it's a wonderful addition to the series. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"Like Spellbinder (or Enchantress as it's known in Oz), Dark Angel once again features human boyos. Oh, and for some people who didn't know, males can be witches too but I won't say anymore.Basically, the story is about a rather silly, misguided girl called Gillian who nearly drowns in ice-cold water because she hears crying and takes it into her daft brain to trudge through snow to 'rescue' this person. As she speeds towards the light (yes, through a tunnel), a beautiful being stops her. His name? Call me Angel he says. So she does just that. She manages to get picked up by a boy she has had a crush on for a long time - David Blackburn.Soon Gillian starts hearing Angel's voice in her head and sometimes she sees him. He promises to make her beautiful, popular and desirable - things she has never been before. Gillian carries out all his requests without fail and David (the human guy) falls in love with her. Slowly though, Angel's requests become more bizarre and the consequences could be very, very dangerous. To reassure her, Angel tells her he would never harm her because he is her soulmate.Meanwhile, Gillian finds out that she is a lost witch (a witch who doesn't know her heritage) and her first trip to a Night World club almost turns out to be a disaster but for the timely appearance of one of our favourite characters - Ash. Increasingly worried and frustrated, and with the help of David, Gillian tries to find out who Angel really is.I have quite a few gripes with this book. Firstly: Gillian is a stupid, feather brained little idiot who thinks that beauty and popularity are what really matter. She's not happy with who she is and has nothing better to do than pine for David.This brings me to my next point. David is a self-absorbed, stuck up moron who only likes Gillian after her amazing transformation from shy duckling (well she's not ugly) to beautiful swan. However, before he drove her home after rescueing her, he hadn't actually noticed her. Then because she's dolled up and popular, he falls over himself trying to be her boyfriend although he already has a girlfriend.Then we have Angel. He is better compared to the two blithering idiots who are the main antagonists but is a whole class below the other characters in the Night World Series. He has a dark past (doesn't almost every boyo these days?) and a terrible secret. His angelic appearance belies his inner nature as he slowly manipulates Gillian in his own plans.Thankfully, Ash saves the day and hence the extra star. With his heroic, dashing, charming ways (maybe I exaggerate) he saves Gillian and the book too. Maybe some people would enjoy this but I could not really understand how Gillian felt and her brain works a lot differently to mine so maybe that's another reason I dislike her.Read it but don't buy it."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"Well what can I say? I've loved L.J Smith's books since I was 15 and I'm now 20 years old, when she writes it's usually with such style and wit that I end up re-reading her books until the covers fall apart. This title is part of the ever successful Night World series, it deals with lost witch Gillian's near death experiance and everything in her world changes from then on...her guardian Angel follows her back and tranforms her from quiet mouse into the most popular girl in school. I would whole heartedly recommend the Night World series but this to me screamed off a Point Horror style book with bits of the Night World lore crammed in. For me this is the worst in the series because I know that L.J Smith is capable of much better, the high point of this book is that there is the reappearance of everyone's favourite Night Person, Ash who saves Gillian from a night world club.It's worth reading as some of the points about the lost Harman babies crop up again in &quot;Witchlight&quot;(9th in the series), and Gillian and David reappear briefly in &quot;Soulmate&quot;(no 6), but as I say it has nothing great to offer to Night World continuity. This book would be much better as a stand alone Point Horror rather than masquerading as a Night World novel, skip straight on to the mighty &quot;Chosen&quot; number 5 in the series!!"},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"it was different and maybe not her best but it was still good. i mean it did have soulmates in and we got to see ash again which gains any book about three stares however short a time its for. i hope as is in the last book"},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"I absolutly love L.

To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"This book, I'd have to say, first off is not exactly a bad book. The idea of it from the beginning, though, is more of a plot that younger readers might be interested in. I did not find Gillian wimpy, however I was offended a bit by her attutude that the only way to be happy was to be popular, and I doubt in real life, simply having an angel telling you how to act would make her popular. I would think it would more of make her seem like a wannabe. She's a bit childish and I think Smith made her that way on purpose. I could relate to her in the fact that I had once felt that way too. I basically left highschool having no friends. I just got sick hanging around the kids that didn't really seem to care if I was around or not, and just decided it'd be better to be alone than to pretend I had some true friends.The main problem with this book, is that the majority of it is spent with Gillian just becoming popular. It isn't until the very end that things actually start to get interesting.

Gillian Lennox is a bit of a drip who spends her life dreaming about David Blackburn and of being popular when one day she wanders off the road after the sound of a child crying. It is there in the snow that she...well...dies. After a few confusing chapters of tunnels of light, grass meadows and doorways, she somehow manages to find herself back in the snow, shivering and stiff. But there is a difference - she is now accompanied by a strange boy named Angel who only she can hear and sometimes see. The very next day Angel begins whispering to her the 'secrets' of popularity which makes her a shining star in her high school, gaining the attention of her darling David.Here is the first mistake of this novel - it chases after the ever-elusive mystery of popularity. This plot is so over-used that I could have written several chapters myself.Anyway, Gillian laps up the new attention as Angel guides her through the ups and downs of being cool, in some situations that are just not plausible enough to work properly. Eventually, Gillian turns out to be a 'lost witch', one of the grand-children of the twins Elspeth and Emmeth Harman, the siblings of the Crone of all the Witches - Edgith Harman. Angel guides her in the crafting of spells and into the Night World briefly (and I emphasise BRIEFLY) where Ash Redfern makes a cameo appearence.When Angel gradually begins making stranger and stranger requests of her she finally turns to David to help her sort it out.This book simply isn't interesting enough to hold a person's attention for very long, there's barely any Night World and the supernatural elements are based on a life-after-death senario instead of the usual vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters and 'found' witches. Even if it was a novel by itself, it wouldn't of been a very good one. A few chapters are too long and ramble too much, the entire plot has been done before and thus is very predictable, the romance is nothing special, and in the context of the Night World series it sticks out like a sore thumb. There are a few references to books past and present, but on the whole you can easily skip this book and move onto the next, as it doesn't do anything for the steadily growing back-story in the Night World series."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"This book had nothing to do with the Nigt World. I was disapointed that it didn't have anything about soalmates or any Night World related subjects. I do not know why Smith would actually put it in the series. This was the only book in the series that actually got boring. If you want cool excitement and romance read Black Dawn or Secreat Vampire!"},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"I couldn't believe this book was written by L. J. Smith. Her other books are really good, but this was horrible! Gillian is weak, wimpy, and superficial. She only cares about poplularity and looks. And then, one day, she cuts her hair and puts on makeup, and suddenly she's the most popular girl in the school! Gimme a break! Kids aren't THAT shallow. David is stupid (he cheated on the SATs and fell for Gillian the moment he saw her with short hair and makeup). It's not even dangerous that he and Gillian are soulmates because Gillian doesn't know she's a witch until well into the book. Angel is a devious betrayer, David is stupid and boring, and Gillian is a wimp. Not a good combination. I much preferred LJS's other books to this one."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"This book is the ultimate revenge story. Sure Gillian is superficial but shes had a rough life and deserves to have her chance to shine in the spotlight.

And she does go to a witches store and she also trys to get in the black iris club once...besides it would be to formulaic if each book was wrapped tightly inside the Night World...each books show different levels of impact the Night World has...plus like all the nightworld books...this deals with a certain kinda topic...Secret Vampire was a girl who was dying and needed to be changed to live...soulmate covered reicarnation and this book delt with a near life experience. Its not the best of the series but its high up there on my list at least."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"Night World #4: Dark Angel, by L. J. SmithAt first \\"Dark Angel\\" doesn't seem like a typical Night World book. Gillian Lennox is a normal teenager; someone that many teen girls could probably relate too. She's not one of the popular crowd but instead is a shy outcast. Her two goals in life are somewhat superficial: she wants to be popular, and she wants David Blackburn to love her. But then who wasn't superficial when they were a teen?Gillian's introduction to the Night World comes when she has a near death experience. On her way home from school, she goes into the snowy woods after she thinks she hears a child crying. Instead she falls into a creek and hypothermia sets in. But she's rescued by Angel, a celestial being who guides Gillian back to the road. But Angel turns out to be more than just a lifesaver, as he starts to help Gillian fulfill her goals. He whispers the secrets of popularity in her ear, helping a shy girl transform into a vivacious butterfly. But as Gillian's status increases at school, she starts to become suspicious of her guardian angel...who is he really? And what does he want with David?The Night World connection in this book is tenuous, but it does make sense. After all, in a world populated with werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural creatures, it's natural that spirits would exist as well. So far Gillian is probably the most identifiable of all the protagonists in the Night World books, as she's your everyday teenage girl who finds out that there's a secret world...and she's part of it. How many of us have wished for that? I know I have.For me, \\"Dark Angel\\" is a solid chapter in the Night World series, but it doesn't really stand out, but then it isn't bad either. It's a good story of growth.3/5."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"This novel literally surprised me. The beginning was page-turning, and immediately I began to think that the \\"dying but living again\\" scene would be the only scene i would like in the entire book. I was gladly proven wrong. I had such low expectations, but the ending made it memorable to me. However, the story of a highschool girl wanting a taste of popularity never ceased to strike a nerve on me. It's really cliche, but i liked the story for the twist, and the \\"gentle\\" ending. I had a warm, fuzzy feeling bubble up inside me while i was crying (which was weird even if I am overly sensitive). I was sad, yet happy with who Gillian ended up with. Gary had such a wonderful charm to him, and I just wished David was more developed and not such a shallow guy. But overall, I'l give it a 4 stars because it was memorable to me. You should give this book a chance and not have such high expectations for it because it surely isn't a Rashel, Mary-Lynette, or Hannah. Gillian is a normal highschool girl that is almost too close to our everyday girls."},{"Title":"DARK ANGEL NIGHT WORLD 4","review":"I love this book! I've noticed that the bad reviews complain that the characters are too superficial, but I disagree. This novel has a lot of profound underlying themes that should be acknowledged. The main character, Gillian Lennox, is more like a teenage girl than any of the other female protagonists in LJ Smith's other Night World books. Gillian comes from a lonely home and longs to find acceptance and happiness. She wants to be popular, but only because she thinks it will bring her the acceptance, love and attention she can't find at home. I think a lot of readers can relate to that ( I certainly could!) and maybe that's why this book gets bad reviews - because it hits a little too close to home.Her \\"angel\\", Gary, is hilarious - I literally found myself laughing out loud at some of his remarks. He helps Gillian grow up and he helps her discover her witch heritage. This is an interesting take on what it's like to discover that you actually belong in the Night World as opposed to many of the other books in the series in which the humans are told of the Night World illegally.This book is also a great follow-up to Spellbinder because it's about the Harman witch clan and also involves a restless spirit that the protagonist must help return to the Other Side. If you look past the \\"superficiality\\" (seemed to me that Gillian was just lonely and sad, not superficial), this is a great read. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Magic Jeepney","review":"If a copy of this book becomes available, I will be the first to buy it.

Gives and reinforces 'ty'coons and 'ty'rants ideology and ruthless/lawless business system."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"As I have often noted this space is dedicated to the struggles of the American (and international) working class and their allies. Part of understanding those struggles is to know where we have been in order to have a better grasp of where we need to head in order to create a more just, socially inclined world. In my travels over the past few years I have noted, even among those who proclaim themselves progressives, radicals and revolutionaries, a woeful, and in some cases willful, lack of knowledge about the history and traditions of the American labor movement. In order to help rectify that lack I will, occasionally, post entries relating to various events, places and personalities that have helped form what was a very militant if, frustratingly, apolitical (or not purely anti-political, especially against its left-wing) labor history.In order to provide a starting point for these snapshots in time I am using what I think is a very useful book, \\"Labor's Untold Story\\", Richard O. Boyer and Herbert Morais, United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers Of America (UE), New York, 1976, that I can recommend to all those militants interested in getting at least a first taste of what the once mighty organized American labor movement was all about. For those unfamiliar with labor history the UE, cited here as the publisher, was a left-wing union that was split by the main labor federations during the \\"red scare\\" of the 1950's for being \\"under Communist influence\\" and refusing to expel its Communist Party supporters. The other organization created at the time was the International Brotherhood Of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The history of that split and its timing that caused a wasteful break in the struggle for a single industry-wide union that has been the goal of all thoughtful labor militants will, of course, be the subject of one of these entries at a later date.That UE imprimatur, for this writer at least, is something of a plus but you know upfront that this is a pro-labor history. That said, this 400 page book is chock full of events, large and small, complete with very helpful footnotes giving greater detail (mercifully placed at the bottom of the page where the subject is mentioned), that helped turned the American labor movement from an atomized, motley group of conflicting racial, ethnic and political tendencies in the last part of the 19th century to something like a very powerful and somewhat self-confident organized force by the 1940's. After that period there is a long term decline that, for the book, ends with the period of the \\"red scare\\" noted above and for the rest of us continues until today.In any case here you will learn about the embryonic stages of the modern labor movement after the American Civil War with its urgent industrial demands to provide goods for a pent-up market war-ravaged market and creation of a transportation and information system adequate to meet those needs. Needless to say labor received short shrift in the bargain, especially at first before it was even minimally organized. The story here it should be made clear, the story anytime labor is the subject of discourse, is organized labor. The atomized working class as a whole minus this organization does not exist as a historical force. That, my friends, is a great lesson for today as well.As such, it important to note the establishment in the 1870s of the National Labor Union and its offshoots, later the Knights of Labor and the role of its class collaborationist leaders. Also noted is the fight in the coal mines of the East and the legendary saga of the \\"Molly McGuires\\" in Pennsylvania our first well-know labor martyrs. Then the fight moves west to the lead, copper, silver and gold mines. That push west can only mean the establishment of the Western Federation of Miners, the emergence of the paragon of an American labor leader Big Bill Haywood, his frame-up for murder in 1905 and the subsequent rise of the Industrial Workers of The World. Wobblies (IWW). Along the way there are various attempts to form a workers party, the most promising, if amorphous, being the Tom Watson-led Populist Party in 1892 before the somewhat more class-based Socialist Party took hold.Of course no political study of the American working class is complete without a big tip o f the hat to the tireless work of Eugene V. Debs, his labor organizing and his various presidential campaigns up through 1920. While today Debs' efforts have to be seen in different way in light of the fact that our attitude toward labor militants running for executive offices in the capitalist state and his \`soft' attitude on the question of the political organization of the working class with an undifferentiated party of the whole class, he stands head and shoulders above most of the other political labor leaders of the day, especially that early renegade from Marxism, Samuel Gompers.The first \\"red scare\\" (immediately after World War I) and its effect on the formation of the first American communist organizations responding to the creation of the first workers state in Russian ( and of the establishment of the internationally-oriented Communist International), the quiescent of the American labor movement in the 1920s (a position not unlike the state of the American working class today), the rise of the organized labor movement into a mass industrial organization in response to the ups and downs of the Great Depression, the \`labor peace' hiatus of World War II, the labor upsurge in the immediate post-World War II period and the \\"night of the long knives\\" of the anti-communist \\"red scare\\" of the 1950s brings the story up to the time of first publication of the book. As to be expected of a book that pre-dates the rise of the black civil right movement, the women's liberation movement and the struggle for gay and lesbian rights there is much less about the role of race and gender the history of the American labor movement. Not to worry, the black, feminist and gender scholars have been hard at work rectifying those omissions. And I have been busy reviewing that work elsewhere in this space. But here is your start."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"\\"Labor's Untold Story\\" is more than just a book about labor history. It's a book about the history that is largely ignored in school. Most history is told from the point of view of the victors, the powerful, and the aristocracy. The average student in the United States leaves high school having forgotten anything that was ever taught in their history classes, because what is taught is rarely anything they can relate to. History is taught as lists of names of rich, powerful, white men, the wars they (made other people) fight, and the dates when anything important happened. It rarely covers what happened to the other 98% of the people.\\"Labor's Untold Story\\" tells the history of the other 98%, and in doing so, makes sense of most of the policies of world leaders. It is also so vividly written, that it reads like a novel rather than a textbook - which makes it far more intellectually accessible than a dry work of academic calisthenics."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"Labor's Untold StoryA history of the American labor movement featuring information you will not find in standard history texts.............."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"This has to be one of the best books I've ever read.

Union people love this book because it makes union leaders out to be martyrs and saviors of the world, standing up to those mean, greedy old corporate capitalists. For these authors, the story of labor is black and white, no shades of gray. Labor can do no wrong and never has done any wrong. The Molly Maguires were not draft dodgers and murderers, but innocent martyrs who got framed. The Homestead rioters were poor oppressed immigrants asserting their right to take control of steel mills, and are not not to be blamed for beating and shooting the police or trying to assassinate the company president. The western miners headed by Communist Big Bill Haywood didn't really blow up mines with dynamite, the mine owners did it just so they could blame the union.

It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted.

This is Labor's \\"untold\\" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"The plans of John D. Rockefeller had more to do with the course of American Labor history than those of Samuel Gompers. This is the main premise of Labor's Untold Story, an economic history of America from Labor's viewpoint. Covering the years from 1860 to 1955, when it was published by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers Union, it presents a fast-paced narrative, skillfully weaving stories in a highly readable and entertaining format. United Electrical was and is a progressive union, in the lead for workers rights. This union has suffered for its advocacy of the worker. It still exists and has a membership of about 35,000 workers in occupations ranging from highway toll-takers to graduate student assistants.Labor's actions have been determined, in the long view of history, not so much by the actions of Labor leaders but Labor's adversaries. Boyer and Morais maintain that Labor has reacted to employers rather than the opposite. Division and destruction of Labor occurred primarily through actions of employers and the government. Multitudes of people have sacrificed their livelihoods, families, and even their lives to further the cause of Labor, with mixed and halting progress. Labor's Untold Story tells us that Business' exploitation of employees causes depression and other economic upheaval, and makes a convincing case.As a beginning example the \\"Molly McGuires\\" of the Pennsylvania coal mining region will do nicely. For starters, historians agree that no group called the Molly McGuires existed in that area in 1873. This was fabricated for publicity purposes by the mine owner, Franklin B. Gowen. He originally recognized the union in the belief that a strike would help to create a coal shortage and push up the price. He used the Molly McGuire myth, along with $100,000, to persuade Pinkertons to come in and help infiltrate this alleged secret organization that was plotting such harm to mineowners. When Gowen cut the miners' wages below the contract level, they struck. The miners and their families were starved, hunted, ambushed and some killed by a vigilante group sponsored by the president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. After six months of hunger and bloodshed they went back to work, defeated. The union was destroyed, and those who had led the strike were blacklisted (not allowed to work in the coal mining industry). Six Irishmen and the men they led in the Ancient Order of the Hibernians were determined to rebuild the union and restore miners' wages. Gowen decided that no action was unjustified in getting rid of these troublemakers. He paid two informants who swore that the Irishmen had freely confessed to many murders in their presence. The first trial featured Gowen, the mine owner, as the special prosecutor. The man who actually committed the crime with which these Irishmen were charged testified against them and won his freedom. Nineteen men were convicted and hanged. The last two men were hanged in a rush so the governor's pardon would not reach them in time to save their lives.Ethnic conflict, a primary tool of Big Business to set workers against one another, is surpassed in its effectiveness by the Red Scare tactic. \\"Calling red\\" has worked for over 100 years. Union organizers and sympathizers, oppressed workers, regardless of the desperate conditions they tried to alleviate, became ineffective once identified as Socialists or Communists. The opposition's definition of Socialism or Communism was often wildly inaccurate. It made no difference whether the charge was true; it still worked to cripple Labor action.Chapter 10, titled Victory, outlines the rise and fall of the Committee for Industrial Organization, the CIO. The first action of the CIO occurred against the Firestone Tire Plant #1 in Akron, Ohio, on January 29, 1936, where the workers had been subjected to speedup. They stayed in the plant for three days, and won their battle. The speed-up decreased, and the base rate of pay increased. Workers everywhere, exhilarated by the success of Firestone workers began to sit down, and joined the CIO. Within six months, the CIO had 2,000,000 members. \\"Top AFL Leaders warned workers that the CIO was a Communistic plot but they continued flocking in, unimpressed. Although the formal charge made by the AFL against the CIO was dual unionism and refusal to abide by majority rule, its leaders never tired in associating the new organization with Moscow.\\" In August 1938, President of AFL Metal Trades Department John Frey told the Dies un-American Activities Committee that the CIO was Communist dominated. \\"This testimony marked the beginning of the a government sponsored blacklist, inaugurating in recent times the Business use of government to destroy Labor via the red scare\\".The strength of the CIO was its left-and-center (political) coalition. Philip Murray, the leader of the CIO after Lewis' departure in 1940, was subjected to extreme pressure from Big Business for several years that finally broke him and the CIO. He declared that all member unions had to support the policies and vote for the candidates that the Executive Council approved. Allegedly, patriotism demanded the expulsion of the left unions. This split member unions away from the CIO, undermining its successful policy of unity in the face of external pressures and politics. The United Electrical Workers, Fur and Leather Workers, Mine Mill and Smelter Workers who had been the pace-setters in raising wage scales and winning conditions were expelled from the CIO on October 31, 1949. Labor's Untold Story, ending in 1955, does not look at possible solutions to the way business is financed in western society. If the stockholders are the tail wagging the dog, should be we looking for some other means of capitalizing business?Labor's Untold Story is remarkable in its ability to recast economic history from the working person's viewpoint. The traditional press does not encourage us to think about what happens in our daily work lives that lessens our dignity as workers and decreases our ability to support our families. Many stories in this book are shocking and heartrending. The authors worked from primary sources and what they judge as credible secondary sources. The book has the ring of veracity. It would be of interest to check other interpretations of the incidents cited in this book to see how others have analyzed them."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"This is a gripping, eye-opening, well-documented account of the American labor movement from its beginnings through to the mid-1950s. It brings alive the great figures and achievements of working class struggle that have been distorted by or excised from mainstream histories. Highly recommended for anyone who has read \\"A People's History of the United States\\" and wants to know more.Sadly, the book pussyfoots around the important role of communists in the labor movement, and almost totally erases the contributions of anarchists-- mentioning Sacco and Vanzetti's political convictions only in passing, and completely eliding the fact that Albert Parsons and other Haymarket martyrs were anarchists. Also, it ends on a rather pat and rosy note of hope that the then (1955) newly-formed AFL-CIO would rally American labor to even greater achievements. Thus it offers few lessons for the routed, coopted labor movement of today. Important conclusions about internal democracy and autonomy that could have been drawn from labor's defeat are left to readers to draw for themselves.One more thing--Notice that those reviewers who paint this book as 'biased' don't actually attempt to refute any of the factual matter Boyer and Morais bring to light. Having a point of view is no crime, in fact it clarifies debate to state your allegiances and conviction in the open, as the authors do. Attempting to conceal bias behind a facade of objectivity, as mainstream textbooks and news sources do, is what ought to be called into question."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"The right-wing reviewers who gave this book a one star, did not read this book. This is REAL history about working Americans and our struggles for economic justice. Just like today, (Enron, Worldcom should ring a bell) there were ruthless,greedy corporations who treated their employees like slaves. &quot;Labor's Untold Story&quot; is a must for union activists, anti-globalization protestors and other independent thinkers who want to get the true stories of labor's past battles."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"This book tells more about the people and the struggles of labor than most labor histories. The authors shed light on the subtle and not so subtle differences between te different unions. This book is well documented and footnoted. It describes business and government attempts to destroy labor with thoroughly documented sources. The book also shows how some labor leaders sold out the movement. This is a must read book for anyone who wants to know more about labor history"},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"Authentic people's history to the core, Boyer and Morais' Labor's Untold Story covers all the gritty drama and history that shaped the world for working people throughout the United States. The exciting and neglected story of working people and their struggles for humane conditions and a living wage is vividly documented in this outstanding work. Any book that starts out with this gem of a Lincoln quote: \\"Outside the family, the strongest bond of human sympathy should be one uniting all working people of all nations, tongues and kindreds\\" is certain to be great.It does a fantastic job of documenting myriad instances of police violence towards striking and locked-out workers. Beginning with the historic Haymarket affair in Chicago where cops instigated a riot during a worker's demonstration and wound up jailing early heroes of the American labor movement who were eventually executed on trumped up charges; Labor's Untold Story goes on to explain the role of the International Workers of the World and Big Bill Haywood, all women and men worthy of emulation. Their struggle for simple free speech rights is told and the Wobblies and Eugene Debs are chronicled in vivid detail. Boyer and Morais put together a sensational description of the Great Depression explaining the causes such as over production combined with poor wages for the masses, and the everyday conditions for the working populace.Probably the finest chapter deals with the Flint Sit-Down strike of the 1930s. The impetus for the debilitating yet exhilarating strike being the speed-ups dictated by management which literally led to death for many workers as they slumped over the production lines in exhaustion. Another interesting fact pointed out in Labor's Untold Story is the National Association of Manufacturers admiration for Hitler. NAM, that reactionary group of rightwing business boyz, certainly did have some fascistic tendencies in common with Nazism according to Boyer and Morais. Lastly the rise of the more radical and worker friendly CIO is documented with a keen eye for detail and the Taft-Hartley Act, which essentially destroyed labor rights in the United States, is explained including the fact that it was virtually written by the business men who had been screaming like spoiled toddlers for its implementation since the Wagner Act.Labor's Untold Story is a welcome history book, one stocked full of fascinating stories that every American worker should have some familiarity with. It's the definitive account of what got American workers the modicum of working benefits many of them now take for granted. Much of this book should have been turned into a wonderful film years ago, but of course corporate owned studios generally stay as far away as possible from true labor history. That's not to discount the few independent studios that have put together fine films about some of these topics on shoestring budget.It should be noted that this book recently came out in a new edition, the cover art portrays an intriguing historical photo documenting a gang of cops beating one worker."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"With a smooth, fluid style the writers reveal the roots and fruit of labor struggle over a period of 100 years. Some may try to criticize this book as being written from a left wing perspective. However, that argument quickly loses any meaning when you consider that concepts like participatory democracy and human/labor rights are inherently liberal/left wing concepts. All of that aside this is a fascinating book that not only is brave enough to look at controversial figures, but balanced enough to also provide criticisms where they are due. Overall the most important aspect of this book is in returning proper perspective to understand the labor struggle in its rightful place as a radical, progressive, people's movement."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"The authors were clearly on the side of labor, however, I felt that their opinions were well backed with facts and references. The writing style was such that the book was exciting and involving. Much more than a history book, it makes you a part of the action. A must-read for anyone interested in the labor side of the labor movement in the United States."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"This is the other side of U.S. history not covered in mainstream textbooks: a people's history. Very readable, it will probably make you angry that you were never taught this history in school. It will probably make you angry that so few people know or remember this history that it is never discussed. Or it will make you angry, if your politics are right-wing, that this book makes labor history available to anyone who likes to read fascinating, real, and previously hidden accounts of civil conflict in our nation throughout the age of industry."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"This is a must-read for anyone who wants to know where the modern labor laws and labor unions come from. It depicts in stark detail the criminal acts against American working people that do not show up in many textbooks."},{"Title":"Labor's untold story,","review":"This book is a corrective to conventional histories of America that often fail to give due attention to the long struggle that led to improvement in the condition of working people in America. When I first read it I was drawn in by the opening chapter, in which the authors describe how Southern pro-slavery writers linked abolition to miscegenation, free love and communism, and how the South hoped to introduce slavery into the north and the territories. The authors point out that slave labor was one of the obstacles to the progress of free laborers. One of the most important themes of this book is that the issues of race and of commumism have been used to divide workers and prevent them from organizing. The book was co-written by an historian and an attorney for the United Electrical Workers (UEW), which was broken up by the federal government because of alleged communist influence. The writers are not afraid of the issue of socialism and communism and accuse the government of thought control, referring to laws that were passed in the 1950's against communist influence in labor unions (and in every area of political life). I have seen criticisms of this work which claim that it is biased and inaccurate, siding in many matters of historical controversy, such as the Sacco-Vanzetti case, the Molly Maguires, and the Haymarket bombings, with the labor point of view and ignoring contrary evidence. In fact it is lively and stimulating reading, and does illuminate parts of our history that aren't much written of. I think its historical accuracy holds up pretty well. Our political life has been in a sense neutered, since the 1950's, by the insistence of the government on driving the very mention of socialism from the realms of political respectability. We are the poorer for this. I recommend this book and I. F. Stone's The Haunted Fifties and a Glance at the Startling Sixties to those who really want a good account of a dissenting view, one that has nearly vanished from public discourse."},{"Title":"To Catch a Tuna","review":"Easy to read, well-developed, full of very useful information. I am now reading back through it and creating &quot;cheatsheets&quot; to take with me on the boat for quick reference - there's that much info!"},{"Title":"Bobby Kennedy : The Making of a Folk Hero","review":"I have read many books about Robert Kennedy in the past 20+ years and found this book to be one of the most personal and enjoyable biographies of Bobby. The author has access to many papers and people not previously quoted. While other books take more of a historical look at Bobby, this book is more personal. The reader will feel as if they know Bobby, which makes the ending all the more painful. It was a fairly quick read because I could hardly put the book down."},{"Title":"Bobby Kennedy : The Making of a Folk Hero","review":"Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child. He was certainly the man for everyone; he was the voice of many.This delightful book provides some personal insights regarding the man's character and political make up. Personal quotes from letters, documents and people who knew him create a strong sense of the man he was.It is a shame this book is out of print because it would be such a welcome addition to any library of Robert Kennedy. The author not only treats him with respect; he views him with an affectionate eye and an almost sympathetic awe.Robert Kennedy was indeed an awe-inspiring person. Diligence was a trait that marked him his entire life. Mildly dyslexic as a boy, he would, by adult life become well versed in classic literature. Acrophobic his entire life, he would, in 1965 climb a previously unscaled mountain in Canada with two professional climbers out of love for his slain brother, the late President. This single act is very inspirational because he tabled his biggest fear and was able to act out of love. From all accounts, this man felt displaced among his older, more outgoing siblings. His was the classic &quot;shouting to be heard&quot; story. In adult life, his voice would become the voice of many; his voice would be one readily and eagerly listened to and taken very seriously.His untimely death in 1968 leaves a painful void in history; one can never help wondering what this at core good, committed and compassionate and very driven man would have accomplished had he won the 1968 Presidential Election."},{"Title":"Bobby Kennedy : The Making of a Folk Hero","review":"\\"Bobby Kennedy The Making of a Folk Hero\\" is a very well-written biography on RFK. Endless speculation abounds over what might have happened during the 1960s-1970s had he been elected. We may never know, but the reader can know more about his life in this great biography.Among the points covered include:1. Early life and relationship with father, mother, brothers, and other family members (he was obviously very loyal to them).2. Search for meaning in life and aimlessness of his early years.3. Experiences as Attorney General, Attorney, Presidential Candidate, and other roles.4. Involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, especially when James Meredith was the first black student accepted at the University of Mississippi.5. Campaigning for President.The narrative flows freely and you can really get a sense of what Bobby was feeling in certain events (JFK's assassination, Martin Luther King, James Meredith, Bay of Pigs, JFK's campaigns, etc.).A great read on a person who could have really been used to change America (some say for the better, others say for the worse).Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend a couple of years ago which inspired our circle of friends to start our own little haiku challenge. The poetry in this book is a collection of snippets from the lives of ordinary but creative people. It proves that everyone can find a little bit of revelation in their lives, in things as simple as a map or mist rising in the cold. And by sending those little snippets to friends they stayed as much a part of each others lives as if they were right next door. I really recommend dipping into this collection and maybe even starting your own haiku challenge...it isn't meant to be classic haiku, but simply enlightenment in daily life, given with love from one friend to another."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"This collection includes some of my favourite poems rendering a very wide range of different situations, observations and feelings. To be precise, &quot;The Haiku Year&quot; is a collection of senryu rather than haiku and only few of the poems have any reference to the season. Instead, most of them focus entirely on different aspects of human life. Many of the poems deal with urban life and a modern life-style. Another thing which makes &quot;The Haiku Year&quot; different from many other collections is its tone. It is less formal and shows less decorum than any collection I have ever seen, which I think is great. But if you object to bad language etc, you may find it too provoking. However, to those who celebrate every aspect of human existence, I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"One of the hardest things to do - as a writer - is to keep things succinct. It is so amazing that the group of writers who had 'a haiku year' all manage to beautifully express moments of their lives in a few lines.Though the poems vary in perspective and subject, they convey equally strong emotions. This book is enough to make you want to gather your own circle. And it's small size makes it easy to bring with you wherever you may travel - whenever you are in need of 18 words of affirmation, frustration or love. It's one of the few books I make sure is near my desk at all times."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"The Haiku Year was all that I anticipated and much more! The haiku were really inspirational and enlightening...I found myself looking at the things surrounding me in completely different ways from day to day. And for all you R.E.M. fans out there who stumbled across this book for one reason and one reason only...it is much much more than that. (Trust me, I did the same thing.)"},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"When did you last have a very strong feeling of the present moment, and a simultaneous, visceral understanding of how that moment fits into the context of life? Writing or reading Haiku poetry has a way of stimulating that feeling. The form is so condensed that it can feel sharp and sudden, like the sound of a balloon popping. This little book is a wonderful introduction to Haiku and also inspires the reader to experience the powerful effect of creating Haiku; after all, the folks who wrote the Haiku's collected here are ordinary Joe's like you or me who all decided to just start writing one Haiku each day.The Haiku Year is much more than a delightful collection of interesting poems. It's also a very interesting window into the lives of seven friends. It's a bit like seven personal photo albums all mixed together, which gives it an enticing, voyeuristic feel for the reader. It's also a bit like a puzzle; did the person who wrote the Haiku about the cold pain of an ending relationship also write the one about the exhiliration of new love found?I highly recommend this book as a gift to yourself. Do you know someone who would be very surprised to receive from you a fresh, red rose? Give them this book instead (or along with)."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"Not many people would argue that Japanese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism aren't valid or relevant religions. They may not be much like the \\"original\\" forms of Buddhism but they are Buddhism and they have much to say (to say the least.) They are just also \\"japanese\\" and \\"tibetan\\" and unavoidably have a context.I am a white American leftist yankee writing haiku, not some Japanese guy from a hundred years ago living on Mount Fuji. The syllable thing is bs anyway, since English syllables do not correspond in length to Japanese syllables.Haiku Year authors never claimed to be Basho or William Higginson for that matter. If you read the Haiku Year you will see that its main purpose is to show a year of friendship and observation (with all its warts) and hopefully inspire other folks to write as well. Its is not a guide to writing haiku or held up as the pinnacle of haiku writing.Muddy Waters is so much better than the Rolling Stones, but\\"Dead Flowers\\" , \\"Monkey Man\\", and most of the Stones stuff rocks on its own merits. It also just might lead you back to Muddy Waters."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"A friend recommended this book, and while I found the book itself fairly interesting by far the best part has been the haiku circle we have created. We do it via email, and try to send a haiku every day to the mailing list. There are about 8 of us who do it regularly, another 4 or so who occasionally participate. It is by no stretch classic haiku, but taking a moment from our day to polish into a limited semi-formal pattern (we try to stick to 5-7-5, but not always, and no other rules - it's haiku if you say it is). We've just completed our first year, and it is very satisfying not only to receive, but also to take that daily meditation to focus on one moment, image, or thought, and try to shine it up to a sharable form."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"If you wish to see the best of contemporary English haiku this is not the book for you. However, it does have an appropriate place in the library. First, the haiku provide interesting insights into the lives of the authors. In keeping to the concreteness of the form, one see the authors' experiences more directly. They write more of what happened rather than what they think about the experience in retrospect. Second, the volume provides an example of an interesting approach to a personal journal - an approach than gains values over time rather than becoming the musings of someone you know longer feel you are. So in a strange way, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"sometimes i think of my father as an aging hippie- a rusty van plastered with bumper stickers, a very liberal viewpoint, and long hair.the haiku year doesn't conform to haiku norms, but it isn't about aging hippies. it's a simple approach to the lives they lead.i have much respect for my dad, and this book is everything about him and and his friends that i love."},{"Title":"Haiku Year","review":"This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever purchased.

I bought it because after reading the authors introduction I felt like I needed to. They wrote a \\"haiku\\" a day to eachother for a year, they admitted that sometimes they forgot, and that their work was not based on the traditional stlye that we are all forced to learn in grade school. The very short, and rather brilliant poetry of Jack Kerouac was their influence. So in actuality the poems in the book are what Kerouac would have called \\"pops\\", and therefore have no syllable pattern, seasonal reference is not required and it would make Basho cry. If you are looking for traditional haiku, this is probably a book to skip.Now, I enjoy traditional haiku as much as anyone. I also have alot of respect for contemporary writers who can adhere to those standards that I, and perhaps many others, cannot. It is not to say that because of this the style should be abandoned, but niether should this idea of a Western form. The poems in this book give that form an excellent start, they embody many feelings and do indeed make the reader look at their life in a new way. I have read it several times over and shared it with friends who agree it has that effect.I love this book because it is modern, involves daily life, and inspires me.

Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a &quot;season word&quot; and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there.

If this book were to be viewed only as a further contribution to the history of the Civil Rights movement it would be a valued addition to a growing corpus. Offering an intimate glimpse of the young participants in that struggle for justice she further provides a poignant testament to the critically important role of the not so young who inspired it. Introducing both the celebrated and the obscure Edelman permits a rare insight into the formation of character and commitment. Long the best friend America's children have ever had, in this book, Edelman serves an older clintele who are likely to find in it a powerful pull to accompany the young on the journey to adulthood. In recalling childhood teachers as well as the dominant figures of the 1960s Edelman brings wisdom, insight and strong spirituality to a much needed reflection on intergenerational sharing."},{"Title":"Lanterns: A Memoir of Mentors","review":"Marian Wright Edelman, in pleasing prose, shares the experiences she had growing up surrounded by a community of mentors, both formal and informal. Edleman talks about the importance of parents, community elders as co-parents and mentors, and the powerful role teachers can play in the development of character. Her college years were greatly influenced by the civil rights leaders of the time, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Robert Kennedy among others. Edelman shares lessons learned from influential faculty and family friends and helps readers understand what it is like to be a part of something larger than themselves.This book, which focuses on the powerful influence that mentors can have on children and young adults, finishes with Edelman's \\"Parent's Pledge\\" and \\"Twenty-Five More Lessons for Life\\". She shares the wisdom gained from her parents and elders as well as her many years of experience working with children. Pearls such as \\"Always remember you are God's child. No man or woman can look down on you and you cannot look down on any man or woman or child\\" and \\"Keep your word and your commitments\\" provide valuable advice for those seeking a strong moral center. This book is a recommended read for anyone interested in life lessons learned from a woman of faith whose experiences have been enriched by her interactions with the mentors in her life."},{"Title":"Lanterns: A Memoir of Mentors","review":"For centuries sailors have relied on the constellations of heavenly lanterns to guide their way. In crisp, vivid prose, Marian Wright Edelman tells us about the heroes who provided beacons of hope and inspiration, helping her find her way through the many moral dillemas of life and stay on course.What is interesting is the sheer variety of backgrounds Dr. Edelman's heroes have. Nevertheless, they all share the author's passion for human rights and social justice. As a bonus, Dr. Edelman gives a brief history of the civil rights era, a nice complement to two other fine books on that fascinating topic, Taylor Branch's &quot;Parting the Waters&quot; and David Halberstam's &quot;The Children.&quot;This book is much more a memoir. It is a call of action and an inspiration for all of us to act for the common good, to serve the community. It is up to the current generations to act as a positive role model for the next, much as Dr. Edelman's mentors did for her.Mentors, lanterns, are important at all times, during the economic boom of the late 1990s, when this book was written, as well as in the troubled initial years of the 21st century.

Unforuntely for me I trust logic and scientific method more than anecdotal evidence. Whilst I am genuinely interested in the Turin Shroud arguments that are based on science, this is, well I suppose it's only capable of preaching to the converted or the gullible.As a footnote, there arent any *actual* \`Mothman Prophecies\` anyway?"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Garbage.

It just kept losing me."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I enjoy reading about \\"unexplained phenomena\\". I really do. I love \\"real\\" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a \\"true believer\\" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. \\"Wow,\\" I thought. \\"That could almost be construed as logical.\\" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: \\"But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.\\"*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the \\"Good story teller\\" catagory and not a \\"ufooligist\\". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin. I must admit I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to &quot;The Mothman Prophecies.&quot; John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you've seen the movie, don't expect the book to be anything like it!(Which is not a new concept by far!)

Although there is only one chapter dedicated to the Mothman itself, there are many accounts of aliens, and other \\"ulrtaterrestrial\\" beings that scared ...me. The book was tragic in a way as well, John's harrassments and the death of his friend at the end of the book. Anyway... John's wit choked a chuckle or two out of me and it takes A LOT to do that when I'm reading a book. This is a must have book for anyone! ..."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"While this book contained some interesting stories about &quot;aliens&quot; and abduction scenarios, it is also very disjointed and out of step. Keel bounces from one unrelated story to the next, and I can't for the life of me understand his ridiculous &quot;energy beings&quot; theory on UFO's; from what I could gather of his ideas, he makes people who think the dark side of the moon is inhabited by aliens seem almost mainstream.

The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I loved this book. Anyone who is interested in UFO's, this book is a classic. Of course, since I live in the area where the story takes places, it holds a very special interest to me."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"First of all, I'll admit-I saw the movie before I read the book. Before you cast judgement, let me say that the concept of the film appealed to me very much, and certainly prompted me to read the book in hopes of learning more about this bizarre series of incidents.That's where my main criticism lies-that the book promises insight into this phenomenon, using the film as its sounding board. Very soon into the novel, however, you'll discover that Mr. Keel ventures off the topic of &quot;Mothman&quot; and more into the realm of UFOs. I remained optimistic that his stories of Men in Black and UFOs would somehow come together to support the larger theme of this &quot;Mothman&quot; , and more specifically, the tragic collapse of the Silver Bridge that was supposedly prophecised. Page after page, chapter after chapter, Keel goes off on a tangent on these UFO stories, many of which end abruptly and few of which seem very relevant.More disturbing to me was his nonchalance about these phenomena, casually stating how he'd witnessed these flying objects routinely-practically every night. He expressed virtually no surprise or awe in any of the descriptions of these rather unbelievable accounts.To go even further, I found Keel's take on these oddities to be almost egotistical. He frequently knocks other &quot;UFO buffs&quot; and indirectly implies that he's the only true authority on such matters. He also doesn't hesitate to mention the many articles, interviews, and public appearances he'd given (several times over).I found the lowest part to be when he and a colleague were viewing &quot;UFOs&quot; in a rural spot. The colleague asks him what he thinks the strange lights are doing, and Keel responds to the effect of, &quot;Well, Mary, I think they're trying to tell me something...&quot; This type of personal attachment which Keel places on the very broad phenomena he describes comes across as if the world (and then some) literally revolves around him.I finished the story feeling mislead, in that I'd read a book on UFOs when I thought it had absolutely nothing to do with them. I would estimate that only 20% of the book actually deals with &quot;Mothman&quot; and his prophecies, the rest is a self-serving collection of UFO research. I also wondered why John Keel hasn't seeked professional help..."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I just finished this book. While entertaining, sometimes gripping and sometimes even frightening, Keel's book is littered with careless suppositions. His patronizing account that Indians (Native Americans) did not possess the technical sophistication to build mounds is short on research and insulting, to boot. He cites only one out-of-date map of pre-white West Virginia, labeled 'uninhabited', as proof that the Natives were too scared to live there. Any search of the West Virginia archives will show that Native presence has a long history in that state. While published in '75, he does not correct such errors in the recent paperback's afterword, choosing only to give us a homily on the unknown. He does well explicating his files but he needs to brush up. The rotten egg smell is often caused by the pharmaceuticals that schizophrenics take. How can you discuss a 'Princess Moon Owl' character and not mention this? He says belief is the enemy of truth. This book wants to believe too much at truth's expense."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"It was about the time when John Keel flashed \\"DESCEND\\" in morse code using a flashlight toward a UFO flying overhead - and it obeyed - that I realized Mothman Prophecies was, er, somewhat questionable in ... well, just about every way.Let's start from considering the book as a purely factual account of the mysterious goings-on in Point Pleasant during the 1960s.In this regard, it's a complete mess. Nothing is in order. Events are instead grouped by topic, and used as a jumping off point to randomly drop in somewhat related anecdotes from hundreds of years of UFO lore. The whole Mothman story becomes completely obscured by incidents being written about in this haphazard way, and it makes it really hard to digest exactly what went down.And forget any sort of neutrality from Keel - he's ready to believe just about every nutcase who comes along with an outlandish story about the paranormal. Reading it from a psychological standpoint is actually an interesting exercise, in that nearly all of the people who have had experiences - sometimes repeat experiences - relate stories in which they are of some insanely huge central importance to the universe. The fact that most of them lead dull, unimportant lives in a small town is a pretty glaring note.Keel in particular is constantly on the lookout for people trying to get him. He quickly becomes the center of everyone's supernatural lives, and anytime something remotely happens, it must be part of the master plan. Pretty soon, people are coming after Keel.For a little while, he actually comes off as fairly self-conscious of how easy it is to get pulled into the world of \\"believing\\" - he chastises other UFO nuts for openly accepting every self-professed abductee that comes along, and criticizes them for hounding these poor people who just want to be left alone - and then does pretty much all that himself.I'm not a believer, I'm not a skeptic - I wanted to read about the events and make my own opinion. Good luck with Mothman Prophecies. The bottom line is that, with all the infinite amounts of crazy things that happened back in 1967 to Keel and his friends (seriously, you won't believe how much there is), there should have been miles and miles of physical evidence - tape recordings, 8mm films, photographs, etc.Instead, there's nothing. No one ever thinks to keep a tape recorder beside them. No one ever thinks to carry a camera to take photographs of the endless stream of men in black that bother everyone.Frankly, I would have excused all of this if Mothman was an entertaining read. But it's really not. What starts off spooky quickly gets tedious, and at the end, you feel like you've just spent an hour with your crazy uncle who won't stop ranting about the elves in his garden."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual &quot;mothman&quot; and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named &quot;Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink.&quot; I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is absolutely outstanding! John Keel really makes us thing out-of-the-box. You really begin to suspect that UFOs are not from \\"out there\\". What they are; no one really knows. There is something very strange going on. Some encounters with these beings are so bizarre that the mystery just keeps deepening. (See also Passport to Magonia). The Universe is most definitely much more complex that we think. I don't believe we are even close to figuring this thing out. And, that's what I love about it!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Another reviewer recommended seeing the movie first and reading the book second. This is a good idea as the movie is good for entertainment value and about 10% truth. Keel's book is the actual events as they took place. The book is told in a straight-forward and scientific manner. I was very glad that the author did not spend the whole time talking just about the Mothman. He also included parts of related phenomenon, such as the men-in-black. Definitely a book that needs to be read by UFO enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read at least 50 books on UFOs and related phenomena, &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; has become one of my favorites along with those of Jacques Vallee. This classic is a must read and reaches the unpopular but most likely true conclusion that UFOs aren't from outer space but are psychic in nature."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO books present their information in dates and names and places and events ... in a sense, completely without any feeling or substance beyond the 'happening.' The shocker of the ending of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES you already know if you read the 1st chapter, but, as you've been drawn further and further into the lives of the main participants, the ending hits you like a sledgehammer b/c you've spent the last 250 pages forgetting all about it. More UFO books should be written with this humanistic approach; perhaps then the subject wouldn't be so taboo."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The author puts together good information on topics that are strange and out of the ordinary. A recap of events that took place in West Virginia during a thirteen month time period in 1966 and 1967. Some of the topics covered are strange creatures, UFO's, men-in-black, and prophetic events.If you are interested in these topics then be prepared to enjoy a few evenings reading some detailed accounts of what happened to some small-town folks who were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been in the right place at the right time. In most instances the author gives a good description of what happened, where it happened, and to whom. These are details that are often omitted in stories of the same type. There are also some good accounts of men-in-black that go beyond the characters in the movie of the same name. You'll want to read the accounts of this aspect of UFO lore.If you are a UFO buff, Ufologist, or self-styled field investigator, then be prepared to be insulted. The author makes no bones about giving little credence or respect to these types of people. Presumably he and a handful of others of the same ilk are the only credible authors. A dichotomy since these are the most likely kind of people to read his book.My only disappointment in the book is that there is not enough cohesiveness to the information. The events written about seem to come together only because they occurred at the same time in the same place."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his \\"colleagues\\" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the \\"people\\" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I found this book to be fairly interesting, but at times the reader becomes bogged-down in the history of these sightings..the book would have been better reading had it focused more on a personal level and investigated the more personal aspects of how these unique sightings changed people in that town. If you expect to find the movie within the book, FORGET it, it is NOT there. Overall, lukewarm reading."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I saw the movie and had to have the book. This book is very scary leaving you grasping for the truth. I was actually scared to the point of turning lights on in my house! I am not usually a fraidy cat like that, but jeesh. Monsters can be killed. Vampires can be staked. Mummies can be burned. Ghost can be lead into the light. What do you do to ward off a creature from another dimension or time or planet that has a hot laser and ain't 'fraid to use it? Nothing as you'll read in the masterful tale of suspense and honesty. Mr. Keel will come right out and tell you when he and others are afraid, hurt, and run for their lives. This book FEELS true in many aspects. My recommendation - read this during the day and try not to think of it at night. Don't answer the door, turn off the phone (if you can), and call a buddy. This ain't your momma's UFO."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIES - Although I am a great fan of the movie, I only recently learned that the source for that film was John Keel's original book also entitled THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIES, a very interesting and enjoyable read. Until reading this book I had no idea that the legend of the Mothman was in any way related to UFO sightings as these were not emphasized in the film.Since I am a 63 year old amateur astronomer and have spent many evening hours while living in Florida, Connecticut, New Jersey as well as upstate New York scanning the night skies with my telescopes and binoculars, I am definitely not a believer in UFO stories. It is nice to hear another theory from John Keel based more on possible other dimensions, world lines and the spirit realm rather than space hardware from other planets. However, I remain more than skeptical. If we can believe John Keel's book, something very strange is going on which clearly undermines our world view of reality. Until I see an impressive UFO (or a Mothman or two) for myself I will remain a very interested skeptic, always open to hearing the latest \\"eyewitness\\" accounts.A very learned friend of mine who has passed away was a lifelong UFO researcher and believer in the hardware theory of UFO's. His great passion for the subject, intelligence, charm and professional standing as a lawyer made it possible for him to have worked with many names in the field including: Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Larry Bryant, Dr. Stanton Friedman, Ray Fowler, Whitley Strieber, and Bud Hopkins to name a few. His interest in the subject, field research and numerous public speaking engagements lasted his entire life. He was also one of MUFON' s public relations officials and always kept me up to date with the latest developments. He provided me copies of the MJ-12 documents when they were first \\"leaked\\" to the public and kept me on his mailing list for years. As a close friend, I did not have the heart to tell him that I could not buy into the hardware theory though I probably let him conclude that I did. However, my interest went as far as reading the latest \\"eyewitness\\" reports and wondering what on earth was responsible for them.This well respected individual was also very interested at one time in Dr. J. Allan Heinick, chief astronomical consultant to the US Air Force Project Blue Book. When I asked my friend what Dr. Heinick's latest findings were he reported to me that Heinick (in his senior years) was starting to believe in alternate dimensions, world lines, and possibly even spirit world theories and for that reason this friend had stopped tracking his work. He also kept me generally up to date but never mentioned John Keel's work, which I now conclude was likely because of Keel's theory in the \\"non-hardware\\" explanation of UFO's. My friend was clearly a believer in the \\"space hardware from out there theory\\" which I was not. But I always kept my ear to the ground regarding new reports of daylight disks, nocturnal lights and close encounter reports (as dubious as these may sound).As an amateur astronomer and over 50 years of carefully searching the skies in more than four states both with and without the aid of optical instruments in isolated locations, I have never observed anything which couldn't be explained in the sky. That is not to say that others have not, but I can't understand why others have been able to witness strange sights where I have not, and believe it may have something to do with \\"who is doing the looking\\", (a statement from the film taken out of context).The top rated reviewer has already said this book is almost as strange as the actual Mothman stories. Also, the fact that apparently related sightings of the Mothman, menacing MIB, numerous telephone problems, scads of prophesies from the void, as well as possible CIA escapades all read like the writings of a true paranoid. All these elements add up to make this book one of the strangest I have ever read. Mind you, I couldn't put it down for several hours a read.The chapter heading by John Keel entitled \\"Paranoiacs are made, not born\\" is also an interesting observation, causing one to question which is the cause and which the effect for any given individual. In John Keel's case I am certain his writings could be the basis of a lively sanity hearing were he a less known and less respected individual. Since his book was on the New York Times bestseller list we Mothman lovers are in good company."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John A. Keel (1930-2009)Let me set the record straight- love the book, hated the travesty of the movie. To compare the movie with the book is much like comparing ancient & modern Rome- there's a few remnants of the original here and there but not much else. This is a classic work that demonstrates how truly strange our world and minds are. From Keel's first published work, \\"Jadoo\\" onwards, I find an author that exemplifies a crisp journalistic style much like a paranormal Mickey Spillane that carries you along at an exciting pace. This is the gothic non-fictional novel of the post-modern world in which intrusions into ordinary reality remain the enigmas of a surreal universe.If you can locate a copy of the Illuminet Press version with the Frank Frazetta cover, you will be rewarded by an insightful afterword by Keel that places much into perspective after the initial events of 1966-67. Highly recommended. This is one book I read every year, waiting for a rainy weekend to escape into the wonder of an eclectic unknown."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"...Still, the book is so far the only comprehensive \\"Mothman\\" analysis from a writer who has spent time in the area. The Mothman phemomena is one that remains a mystery. Something bizarre happened in West Virginia, and it wasn't the first time. The Flatwoods Monster is another puzzling incident that happened several years before. And across the Atlanctic, not too many years after Mothman, England gave us \\"Owlman.\\" What are the connections between these, and other \\"high strangeness\\" encounters? What WAS Mothman? It is a mystery that needs to be remembered, and explored. Keel does that. This book belongs on everyone's shelf -- anyone who is interested in the paranormal.Hopefully the new edition of this title will include sources, index and the like. The inclusion of such would add greatly to this resource."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I was a truck driver from Huntington WV and had just crossed the Silver Bridge a few days before Dec 15. I remember that horrible tragedy to this day. There was some strange goings on in and around Pt Pleasant at that time. I firmly believe John Keel has just about figured it all out, (as much as humanly possible). He has a different approach as compared with all the standard UFO crap out there. This is a eye opener, with all the respectable people he talked to which he knew not to be lying. You must read this book, but pay attention because he does skip around. You will understand after you get into it that it is all tied together. VERY INTERESTING AND SPELL BOUNDING---------Al, Leesburg, Fl"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel is a true investigator. He leaves no path untread upon in his search for the truth behind the UFO phenomenon. His countless accounts of the Men in Black and their games will inform you as to their place in all of this, frighten you and even make you laugh out loud. His work helps defend the theory that aliens are inter-dimensional rather than extra-terrestrial. Even if you are not a UFO buff, this is a smooth, yet thorough induction into this strange and all too close world. Even for you non-believers, the connections made in this book will at the very least gnaw at you and most definately entertain you. It is by far the most engrossing book you may ever encounter, on many levels. It will literally change the way you look at the world and leave you with many thoughts that you may never shake. One being, &quot;I don't ever want to be visited. It's no one-shot deal!&quot;"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"As someone who has enjoyed reading about UFOs and other paranormal events while maintaining an open-minded skepticism about them, I was looking forward to reading this classic 1975 book about the bizarre events in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966 and 1967. I had read a few brief summaries of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in other books, and they had usually referred to Keel's book as the standard work on the subject. After seeing the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" film (which is excellent, by the way) I bought a copy of this book. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed in the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\". This appears to be one of those rare occasions where the movie is actually better than the book. Unlike the film, Keel's book has an annoying tendency to go off on tangents - he spends the entire book simply wandering from one story to the next, with no overall theme or focus to tie the stories together.Keel reminds me of a person who starts one story, then breaks off in the middle and launches into a second, unrelated story, then breaks off the second story and starts telling a third unrelated story, and so on. Much less than half of the book actually deals with the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in Point Pleasant. The rest of the book consists of Keel's rather wild-eyed speculations and theories (which he never bothers to support with anything resembling credible evidence) of how UFOs, demons, ghosts, the \\"Mothman\\", \\"Men In Black\\", etc. are all related. Keel repeatedly ridicules the notion that UFOs might be alien spacecraft, and instead he makes the dubious argument that UFOs are \\"projections\\" from \\"energy beings\\" from a \\"parallel universe or dimension\\". Keel recounts several stories of \\"Mothman\\" sightings, creepy phone calls to residents of Point Pleasant, and the like, but he rarely offers any evidence that the stories - or the people telling them - have any credibility.A couple of examples from the book illustrate how difficult it is to consider Keel to be a serious researcher: in one passage he writes that he helped a couple to contact a UFO by telling them to go outside their home at 9 pm one night and shine a flashlight in the direction of anything \\"unusual-looking\\" in the night sky. Lo and behold, writes Keel, a large orange UFO suddenly appeared over the couple's home, and loud beeps came out of their TV set. Keel then proudly announces that he has given this same \\"insane\\" (his word) advice to many other people, and almost invariably something similar happens: doorbells ring for no reason, UFOs appear over their home, etc. It's nice to know that Keel has discovered a foolproof method for contacting UFOs. In another section Keel describes driving down a lonely road near Point Pleasant and feeling absolutely terrified along the same stretch of highway. After some \\"experimentation\\" (which involved nothing more than walking back and forth over the stretch of road where he feels terrified), Keel announces that his terror was caused by a \\"beam of ultrasonic waves\\". Given that he has no equipment to check for an \\"ultrasonic wave\\", I'm still wondering how he came to that conclusion.As for the notion that Keel is believable because he does on-site research, simply repeating other people's stories as the absolute truth doesn't qualify as research. Most credible researchers of the paranormal do background checks to try and verify the witnesses' claims, but not John Keel. Instead, he seems to believe that every person he spoke with in 1966 and 1967 is telling the absolute truth, and no further investigation is required. And the more outlandish and eccentric the story, the more Keel seems to trust the witness. I have read numerous books on UFOs and other strange phenomena which have thorough research and references to back up the writer's claims. Do NOT be fooled into thinking that Keel is a serious-minded and objective researcher, as this book is anything but serious-minded or objective. When Keel does manage to focus on the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in Point Pleasant, the book improves considerably. However, Keel's penchant for going off on tangents with one unrelated story after another, and his insistence in focusing upon himself and his theories as much as the \\"Mothman\\" sightings themselves, made this book a real disappointment. If you want to see a first-rate account of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in West Virginia, then buy the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" Special Edition DVD set and watch the excellent \\"Searching for the Mothman\\" documentary contained therein. This fifty-minute documentary, which aired on the FX cable channel, is much more believable and realistic than Keel's book."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"While Keel's book is not classy literature, even in the science fiction genre, the story is fascinating enough to keep you reading. I found this book while rummaging around in the &quot;State of WV&quot; shelves in a local bookstore. I had just moved to Pt Pleasant, WV and was interested in the local lore. I was surprised to learn that this story happened in the very town I had just made my home. I began asking the townspeople about the Mothman and found that no one would talk about it. When I would bring the subject up they would change the subject or act like they hadn't heard me. I was intrigued. I made a trip out to the TNT area where much of the story took place. Having traveled over much of the U.S., I can tell you that the TNT area is the most spooky place I have ever seen. I defy anyone to go there and not have the hair stand up on the back of his neck. I couldn't wait to get out of there and I've never gone back. The story is being made into a movie. I can hardly wait. BTW. I am 66 years old, not 12.

Well, frankly, I don't believe all of it, though I'm sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. But in all the lengthy annals of Fortean/ supernormal/ paranoia-lit journalism, Keel does stand out as an author with an above-average storytelling ability. He also has the ability to not take himself entirely seriously, a trait often sorely lacking in the genre. With all that and a trans-phenomenon Grand Unified Theory of Weird Stuff to offer, this book is definitely worth checking out for those interested in the field."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Investigators like John Keel don't seem to exist anymore, so get this book while it's still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. It will probably never be able to compete with the books that assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient deities. People want something to believe in. &quot;Belief is the enemy&quot;,warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with, but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed..."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"You'd have thought it would be a quantum physicist, but it was the great biologist J.B.S. Haldane who said, &quot;I suspect that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.&quot; John Keel's most seminal work is dedicated to the proposition that the universe is even queerer than that. Is he for real? Is the universe for real? Did any of this mishegass, other than the briefly famous bridge collapse, really happen? I don't know; but there is no better guide into the surreal realms of &quot;high strangeness&quot; than Mr. Keel, and if you can suspend disbelief for a couple of hundred pages, you will at the very least have heard the creepiest campfire story ever told.More than any other living writer, Keel has inherited the slippery mantle of the late great Charles Fort. He shares Fort's daring, his sardonic sense of humor, his tender concern that &quot;damned&quot; facts not disappear into oblivion, his naive acceptance of every story that comes down the pike, his generous willingness to entertain any theory, and his delight in watching perverse phenomena blow every theory to smash. But if Keel's really a reincarnation, then Fort must have learned how to write during his last go-round in the Bardo, because Fort was hard slogging and this book is a zippy ride.What Keel gives us is a set-piece blocking all exits from what might as well be known as Keel's Law: &quot;Ufology is a subdiscipline of demonology.&quot; He gives us a community and a year, Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1966, where UFOs are nearly as common as fireflies, where eight-foot birds with glowing eyes engage in VTOLs without moving their wings, where Men In Black patrol the streets and synchronicities run riot, where insectoid voices control the horizontal and the vertical on phone lines AT&amp;T thought belonged to them, where contactees receive eerily precise prophecies that are wrong about everything except their specifics. Keel draws no coherent lesson from all this, except that we are cockeyed optimists if we persist in thinking of reality as coherent.Personally, I suspect that Keel's Law is right, and further that demonology is also a subdiscipline of psychology, but of a psychology that academia has not yet begun to penetrate, and would be well advised to look into carefully. (Check out Bryan's book &quot;Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind&quot;, about an abductee conference that MIT was once tricked into hosting, for some initial clues about the trail such a psychology might follow.) In any case, this book demands a place on any shelf of UFO literature, however short. It represents a nutty, true-unbeliever extreme by dint of which the rest of the shelf, the skeptical and the puzzled and the true believers alike, will be kept honest."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you're new to the paranormal and/or crytozoological studies, you should deffinately pick this up. Its light reading, so you won't have to constantly analyze if something is symbolic or not. Its written like an episode of &quot;Law and Order&quot;, really. In the book, Keel relates events that he experienced, centered around the West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Very rarely does Keel ever color the events with his view or interpritation of things. Usually he relates the facts and lets the reader come to any conclusions that need to be come to. This is very important, as usually books of the paranormal ilk are SATURATED with the authors view of what a specific event is or means. Overall, its highly enjoyable. If you are even remotely interested in paranormal phenemonons, this is a fantastic book to start with. Any conclusions you come to will be those of yourself based on the evidence provided, not because the author colored things to make it appear more one way than another. The only thing that could have made this book any better was maybe a deluxe edition that would include pictures of some of the reoccuring characters and scenes, such as Mrs. Hyre and the TNT area. Sometimes sketches of visiting entities are mentioned, it would have been awesome to see these sketches. There is a whole realm of possibilities for additional photographic illustrations to this book that could add more depth and realism. That is the only thing that could have made this book better, for what it is. However, this is just bonus material, none of it is needed to better understand the story, so there is no reason to mark down for such things not being included."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read this book umpteen times when younger, it was very interesting to skim back through it again. Back in print because of the less-than-stellar name-only movie, I was able to get it through my local library.I grew up with John Keel and his ilk. I hungrily chomped down anything Fortean, anything High Strange. Since this was back when such books were far more scarce than now, I tended to re-read the ones I had and \\"Prophecies\\" was one of my favorites.And TMP is an entertaining read, so chock-full of accounts of extraordinary flying objects, unlikely birds, monsters, poltergeists and Men In Black as to have been the inspiration for the whole run of The X-Files.Entertaining? Certainly. Serious research material? Another question.It has been at least 17 years since I last read the book. From that remove, a fresh exposure to it has a different taste. It is now in fact difficult not to view it as a paranoid fantasy.I have respect for John Keel's aspirations as a researcher. Several of his precepts have worked solidly into my thinking. A phrase early on in the book --\\"Paranormal phenomena are so widespread, sodiversified, and so sporadic yet so persistentthat separating and studying any single elementis not only a waste of time but also willautomatically lead to the development of belief.\\"-- has great resonance for me. I have seen far too many people start down the slippery slope of belief and become unable to climb back up.And Belief, as Keel famously said, Is The Enemy. To accept a belief is to wear the blinders accompanying that belief, and miss things not associated with it. Beliefs are sticky things, easy to pick up but hard to set down again.The quote above seems to support a position of investigatorial distancing from the subject, a desirable objectivity. But unfortunately for Keel's credibility he continues with the next sentence:\\"Once you have established a belief, thephenomenon adjusts its manifestations tosupport that belief and thereby escalate it.\\"That is quite a different thing from the objectivity just previously presented! \\"Get interested in weird stuff,\\" Keel is saying, \\"and not only will you become sucked in but you will be made an active focus of it.\\"TMP is full of instances of Keel himself being made the focus of \\"the phenomenon\\". Odd people come to town and ask not so much about UFO sightings, but about Keel's activities and interactions with his associates. His car is broken into and notes taken, his mail is tampered with; someone seems to be tapping his phone. On face value, the classic claims of a paranoid, only in this case it is not The Government which is doing it but Someone Else, the Agents of The Phenomenon.Even the title smacks of delusions of grandeur: where there are \\"prophecies\\", there must be a \\"prophet\\", and the attentions Keel say were paid to him would prove him to be such an important personage.A simultaneous problem and attraction of TMP is the wealth of anomalous reports with which Keel supplies us. In Keel's universe anomalous events are happening so continuously as to make those who are not witnesses feel inadequate. In the quote above he calls paranormal phenomena \\"sporadic\\" but you wouldn't know it from this book - unusual events are so constant as to not be unusual. Just as pornography may have the effect of leading you to believe that everyone else on the planet is having more and more-varied sex than you, so does \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" make one feel unstudly for not having extraordinary paranormal experiences nightly.\\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is a landmark book in many ways. It helped to associate in the public's mind UFO reports with other paranormal activities such as monsters and poltergeists. (Just as Jacques Vallee's \\"Passport to Magonia\\" associated UFOs and fairy belief, in a more scholarly way.) TMP helped to standardize the image of the Men In Black, with results familiar to any moviegoer or X-Files fan. It gave us The Mothman, a critter right out of nightmare, resurrected by the movie to the degree that Mothman reports are now retroactively presented after major disasters.But upon re-visiting this book, I have to feel that it is has less value as a representation of the events of the day, and more value as a record of one man's fascination with, and descent into, a particular form of belief. All the more ironic since Keel warns us against that belief even as he embraces it."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The movie was good but forget about connecting that flick to this book. This book was first written in 1975 - NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO! If you have ever read \\"true story\\" UFO books before, then you have probably come across a lot of recent material that seems more plausible like \\"The Gulf Breeze Sightings by Ed Walters\\" and \\"Fire in the Sky: The Walton Experience by Travis Walton\\" but both of these books have since had their day - they have been pretty much debunked and are widely known as absolute hoaxes, if not downright fabrications at best. After 30 years, The Mothman Prophecies is still a SOLID story because of the amount of witnesses to the events, biological medical evidence and the final catastrophe that ended the phenomena. The only case that debunkers have against this story is that the Mothman could be an owl or a large species of crane, but eyewitnesses deny that it is any such animal.In fact the Mothman is not part of any category of cryptozoology. Much like the chupacabra, it is a zoological impossibility so the only possible realm of existence for this thing is genetic experimentation, an apparition or extraterrestrial. The latter category is what the Mothman falls into and this book is all about just that.Keel went to Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1966 and 1967 to investigate a series of unexplained happenings that the towns people where experiencing at the time. Most importantly was the sighting of a creature that could only be described as some sort of a flying monster. This creature, dubbed the Mothman, was new to Point Pleasant but not to the history books and so Keel went digging around to see what he could find. While doing this he unearthed an astonishing amount of information on this mythical beast. At the same time there was some UFO activity in the area and Keel was the one who made the connection between the Mothman and the UFOs.Essentially \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is a book that documents and reports on a HUGE UFO FLAP in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Coupled with this event where strange lights in the sky, encounters with the unknown, men in black, psychic phenomena, cattle mutilations and an impeding of Keels investigation by possible secret government agencies. Keel is only one of many people that where exposed to these events and although the book must be treated skeptically, it does open your mind because there is simply too much activity taking place to call it a hoax or work of fiction. Various people seemed to be attacked by the Mothman. Even an ambulance used for blood donation was chased and attacked by the thing. In short this is an excellent UFO book that still stands the test of time.For years we have been waiting for its re-release and the movie has helped spur that along. When you compare this book to other true stories about UFOs you really begin to appreciate its value. I have read a lot of UFO books and books about strange encounters but this is the one that really got me gripped from start to finish. After reading this book it is very hard to see it as anything less than real and truthful. \\"Occam's Razor\\" tells us that in explaining a thing no more assumptions should be made than are necessary - but when applied to this book you must explain how everything occurred in this one region to so many people. Keel not only researches the Mothman but documents everything that happened at Point Pleasant during that fateful period of time.It is a whopping story that is highly intriguing, absolutely baffling, horrific and extremely hard to dismiss as a work of fiction. It is not until you see the Mothman documentary that is on the movie DVD that you actually get to put faces to the people in this book and hear them talk about their experiences. This is first rate investigative reporting and an amazing story to boot that can't simply be dismissed as all in Keel's mind, or a hoax or fabrication. Strange things went on in Point Pleasant, West Virginia and the people where scared. Then it ended with a massive tragedy and the supernatural phenomena stopped. There is no doubt that something completely out-of-this-world occurred at Point Pleasant and you should not miss reading about it.Exceptionally riveting journalism!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"...And this is my story. I've been there and seen it. Even Mormon History circa mid-1800's includes the unexplained occurences so well depicted in this book. While Point Pleasant has been &quot;Californicated&quot; in the past 6 years, a night drive through the area will still produce a puckering sensation. This is Twin Peaks FOR REAL!!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I still cant believe this book was turned into a movie. Though the movie didn't capture even 5% of the scariest moments in the book. This book could easily change your perspective on UFO's and monsters forever. Despite the fact that this could be John Keels most unpolished work it is perhaps the most ground breaking too.If you are the type of person who can believe that scores of people would frantically contact local authority and the press to foolishly report a rare stork with red eyes then this book isn't for you. A 7-ft leathery gray humanoid with glowing red eyes and a huge wingspan that flies fast enough to chase cars down is not something dozens of people are mistaking for anything else.I almost didn't buy this book years ago when I first heard about it. It just seemed too fantastic. When I finally picked it up I was stunned by all the 1st hand experiences of the author.The first Wednesday after I read the book I looked outside my house for UFOs. An old school Cadillac rolled by and made a turn at the end of my block, which would force it to back track. The windows were black. Nothing else happened. When I got back inside I had a message from my best friend. He was somewhat frantic. He said: \\"Dude, I just heard a really weird UFO whirring sound outside of my house.\\" His girlfriend heard it too, and she told him in an uncharacteristic manner: \\"better go tell your friend what just happened\\" I hadn't told him what I was reading (or anyone else) and I never had a serious discussions about UFO's with him before that event."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"There is a lot about the 60s' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm movie cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of \\"Mothman\\" and I simply cannot accept the author's statement that all those camera's that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other.The movie was excellent but then it was not based entirely on this wacky book which is written in kind of a random fashion and is not all that good in the first place. \\"Show me the pictures.\\""},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I saw the movie and was intrigued enough to read the book, which I thought would maybe give a better idea of what really happened in West Virginia that year. I was disappointed to find that Mr. Keel spent a lot of time dwelling on UFO encounters and the history of UFO encounters and spent little time talking about the events in West Virginia, other than how it blended with the history of UFO-logy. The movie was more interesting, and I don't know how they developed a movie based off of this book. I didn't buy the book to read about Air Force involvement (or maybe lack thereof) in UFO sightings or about how Mr. Keel had been hunting UFOs and UFO witnesses. A big letdown."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I like reading from time to time about unexplained phenomena. Why have I bought this book ? - it is another unexplained thing to me; probably happened because I noticed that motion picture had been made based on this story.What a flop it is !There is hardly any action in this text and I can't imagine how somebody was able to create anything suitable for big screen.Book is simply boring, nothing but repetitive descriptions of very old, supposedly true experiences and \\"facts\\" related to strange lights, poltergeists, UFOs, Men In Black and other encountered critters. Whole information is presented in a very chaotic and mixed up way. Facts are taken from all kind of local trashy newspapers, old UFO magazines and questionable at best police reports, as if these were proof of anything.Besides, today in XXI century, after more than 40 years (book was published in 1975 and tells about events taking place in 50es and 60es), UFO and paranormal researchers try different approaches and changed their attempts to explain \\"unexplained\\". Views presented by the author are simply nave, outdated and archaic.He crammed in the same sack: angels, Beelzebub, MIBs, flying dragons, vampires, robots, haunted places, creatures from different spaces and dimensions, ancient history, believes and you name it.\\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is good for kids, grade 7 max, who like intriguing horror stories but not for adults who like to read more serious stuff about strange and unknown happenings.I had enough of this rubbish in the middle of it and tossed this book into the garbage.Luckily it was cheap. Do not waste your time reading; it is worse than tabloids standing on display in your local grocery store."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises &quot;hick&quot; UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations.

He leaves no path untread upon in his search for the truth. His exceptional accounts of the Men in Black are strange, frightening and even humorous at times and help the reader to better understand their place in this whole game. His work defends his theory that aliens and UFOs are inter-dimensional rather than extra-terrestrial. Even if you are not a UFO buff, his book is an easy yet extremely thorough initiation into this world. And even for you non-believers, it is recommended reading. It is by far the most entertaining book you may possibly ever encounter, on many levels. It will change the way you look at the world and leave you with many thoughts that you may never shake.

Based on the book, mothman is a tool of hyper dimensional denizens to distract the population at a time lot of animal mutilations going on. The book is a thrilling ing in its narration, subject, content and truthful.In the process the reader will get the understanding of the psychological, physical, emotional mechanics UFO denizens use to distract and marginalize the curious willed people who wants to research and share. Highly recommend the book. Movie is only tip of the iceberg. Authors later books on UFO's has more details of his experiences that shaped his understanding of the reality. Easy to read, absorb and understand the much touted complex subject of UFO's. Author pretty much concludes that hyper dimensional denizens with time travel capabilities uses different spectrum of frequencies to create the distraction and harm the curious."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Think flying saucers are real? Lie awake nights listening to Art Bell? Do you get an eerie feeling that something significant is happening when spooning mashed potatoes onto your plate? This book will either set your mind at rest or scare your socks off, possibly a little of both.Yes, we've been visited, but not by creatures from Venus trying to warn us about nuclear proliferation, though you may be abducted, and an anal probe is not completely out of the question. This is an investigation of sightings, in the vicinity of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, during 1966 and 1967, of UFOs and many other strange things, including a ten-foot-tall, black, winged devil-bat creature with glowing red eyes that terrorized people in lonely farmhouses (\\"Mothman\\"). Not to mention Men in Black who showed up next day to warn witnesses to keep quiet. The string of incidents culminated with a bridge collapse (depicted melodramatically in the movie of the same name), after which the visitations stopped.Keel's account of his stay in Point Pleasant, his interviews of witnesses, and his own encounters is all too credible. To make any sense of this, the only thing I can conclude is, there is a semi-intelligent force on our planet that has been manifesting as \\"lights in the sky\\" and making mischief, some of it lethal, for millenia. In each age humans fasten on the explanation that most closely parallels current superstition, science, or popular culture, whether it be flying saucers and Roswell, witches riding broomsticks lighting their way with lanterns, or gods, pans and centaurs flitting through forests. The forces or intelligences (OK, call them demons) seem willing to play their part, adapting to the zeitgeist.Periodically an individual is singled out for \\"illumination,\\" usually at a lonely crossroads. That lucky person founds a cult, gathers followers, and the whole thing ends with a bunch of people on a mountain top waiting for the mothership, which never shows up, unlike that Spielberg movie.Studying these phenomena is exactly what can attract these demonic creatures to you, so the best advice is, ignore the whole thing, and for heavens sake don't read this book.Just kidding. I've read it several times over the years, as well as Keel's \\"Our Haunted Planet\\", which I also found fascinating, and recommend to you."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Good book. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in supernatural subjects or anything unexplainable. The book explains much more than Mothman and WV. It explains the relation between Mothman and the supernatural occurrences that took place during that time. Definetly a good book."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"One reviewer of this book berated those who gave it high reviews with the usual ad hominem attacks created by the quasi-literate. Can you take this work at face value? To some degree, yes. Does the \\"Mothman\\" really exist? I think before you answer that question some homework assignments need to be completed. There's a revolution in the understanding of paranormal events, ufology, cryptozoology, and the like. Amazingly, most of the subject matter I've read on these topics throughout my lifetime CAN be FAR better understood using this POV. I suggest any and all who have interest in these topics start studying: Patrick Harpur's \\"Daimonic Reality..\\" and George P. Hansen's \\"The Trickster and the Paranormal\\", both intense as any textbook I encountered in post graduate work, are highly recommended as the first step."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"One of Keel's most appealing sentiments: these strange phenomena are terrestrial in origin, not extraterrestrial.I could not put this book down.

Aside from the fact that Keel often goes off on crazy tangents about how he thinks the world works, the book is pretty good. I'm not sure if all of this actually happened, but if it did then I'm sold!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I don't know quite what to make of this book, because I don't know quite what to make of the events that occured in West Virginia (and Ohio and Long Island, among other places) in the late 60's. The story is probably well-known if you've seen the movie. The book does differ somewhat from the movie but this isn't exactly a linear tale. I did read that Keel was pleased with the results.In brief, in the late 60's a lot of peculiar events took place in the area around the Ohio/West Virginia border centered around the town of Point Pleasant, WV. Most of the events involved sightings of the Mothman (whose name was coined from a Batman villain) but there were various other Men in Black types running around Point Pleasant too. Other events are too numerous to mention and seem to involve lots of peculiar folk showing up on people's doorsteps and beeping phonecalls and maybe an abduction or two. The events culminate in the collapse of the Silver Bridge. Despite some criticisms of the book (the reason for the Bridge collapse had a scientific explanation), Keel does not suggest that the tragedy was caused by the Mothman, et al. He simply suggests that these visitors knew about it and purposefully misled him and others. How did they know? Keel thinks they are time-travelling visitors from another dimension that come here for purposes unknown and maybe unknowable, although possibly just because it amuses them. It all sounds fairly ridiculous when you try to explain it. Keel seems reasonable and he's well-respected by his peers (his peers, granted, probably including some rather flaky folks.)The book is well-documented and not especially sensationalistic. I actually grew tired of the repeated stories of odd occurences at crossroads and a seemingly endless parade of unexplained lights in the sky. It is short and worth a read if your interest was especially piqued by the movie or you just have an interest in this sort of thing, in which case adjust the rating upwards. Otherwise, this book probably isn't for you. Do be prepared to be haunted by Keel's final words (a quote from Charles Fort, a famed student of the unexplainable): \\"If there is a universal mind, must it necessarily be sane?\\""},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you're into the strange and unexplained,UFOs,strange creatures,then John Keel will never disappoint you.This book provided hours of pleasant reading but it should've been named &quot;My ordeal with the Men In Black&quot; because the actual material involving the Mothman is miniscule compared to the frightening ordeal he describes involving the MIB."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"When I heard a movie was to be made of &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; I was jubilant not only because of the opportunity to see how the Pt. Pleasant phenomena would play out on film but because I knew the movie would bring attention to the mesmerizing, enjoyable, book, which I have owned for decades. The filmmakers wove a fictional story-structure in which to inplant just a few of the bizarre happenings reported in John Keel's book, and I feel they did about about as well as I could have hoped. I was thoroughly engaged by storyline, acting, and the kernels of Keel's theories that were retained and presented. But readers need to understand the difference between a cohesive yarn set in the present and the disjointed happenings that took place decades ago in West Va. A goodly number of reviewers of the book have picked up on Keel's contention that these spooky thingees, whether sporting wings or dressed in funereal black and not quite &quot;passing&quot; as real folks, are mutable in form but consistent in intent: they love to mess with humans. Somewhere in interdimensional space or nonspace they probably get together and cackle with glee over how to torment us next. As an orthodox Christian (an Episcopalian who believes ALL that creed I recite weekly)I happen to believe that the weird beasts and beings one encounters and all the phenomena that surrounds them like Pigpen's dust clouds during a flap such as the one in Pt. Pleasant are, forgive the non-PC term, demonic. As in from Satan--as in hanging out with the fallen angels. I'm sure Mr. Keel, and many others who've enjoyed the basic contention of the book (and movie), would be more comfortable with the less religiously charged terms &quot;psychic beings,&quot; &quot;interdimensional creatures,&quot; and similar names. But Mr. Keel, the movie, and I are all headed to the same basic idea: you should avoid these things and ignore them as much as possible. Let them in an inch, and there goes YOUR neighborhood. As in the movie, don't answer that phone; as in the immortal words of Ogden Nash, &quot;If called by a panther, don't anther!&quot;"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read The Mothman Prophecies back in 1976, I just head to check out the audio book. I was not disappointed. Mr. Keel is always entertaining! I wont go into what the book is about since that information is already described. I will say that this audio book is well read by Craig Wasson - it is just an added pleasure! Very informative and entertaining! Buy this-you wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is a convincing collection of data that leads the reader towards John Keel's thesis: basically, UFOs are not from another planet. They are closer to psychic energy, and connected with some encounters throughout history with what are called monsters, ghosts, and little people. Therefore, these phenomena are truly Unknown, and probably Unknowable to the mortal human mind. If your spiritual beliefs tend towards the animist, the earth, spirits, and ancestors, Keel's ideas may resonate with you. He uncovers connections between the seemingly disparate paranormal entities mentioned above. Another of his books,The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings, is a quicker read, delving into some of the same material, but covering a broader spectrum of encounters. The Mothman Prophecies, with the higher quantity of data that fits into this novel-length book, is the more convincing of the two, because he builds his thesis slowly, using the data. Keel is not a conspiracy theorist; in fact he spends a great deal of time refuting such popular theories. If you are interested in the Paranormal, you should read this book and process your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I received this book last week and I just finished it yesterday. By the way delivery was pretty fast,I used the Amazon Prime option.I ordered this book because after watching a TV show program which talked about the so called \\"Mothman\\" it made me curious enough to make me want to know more.I bought this book because it was rather cheap and it had a few favourable reviews here on Amazon.I was looking forward to reading it but I've got to say I'm pretty disapointed with the book. I read most, if not all the reviews so I knew this book was somewhat controversial. But I was disapointed for the simple reason that from a book who's title is \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\", I would expect it to talk about the Mothman. It actually doesen't talk about him much.There's just a few lines about him at the start and then he's mentioned a few times throughout the book,and that's just about it.If the author John Keel would have entitled it \\"My weird experiences in 1966: UFO's, contactees,MIB and weirdos\\" it would have been much better and would have gave the reader or potential customer a better idea of what this book is all about.Now Keel's idea is that Supernatural occurences have all the same origin. I'm not going to discuss that here because you could find more elsewhere.But what bothers me is that this mere idea is a given fact for Keel,as if it has been totally and undoubtely demonstrated. Obviously it isn't.Now I believe in paranormal phenomena,and the book does contain some cases in which UFO's and poltergeist activity happen together in a collegated manner.But still that doesn't really prove much as far as I'm concerned, and it's certainly not enough to discount the Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis for UFO's.But that is what Keel is doing in this book.Plus he also seems to contradict himself. According to him the fact that the US Government has been active in suppressing and ridiculing information on UFO's is just a \\"cultural belief\\". The result of \\"propaganda\\" and \\"brainwashing\\",and that there is actually nothing to it. But then towards the end he states that the CIA/USAF 1953 decision to debunk and downgrade flying saucers was a responsable course of action.Anyway I'll rate this book two and a half stars because the title is very misleading. Some interesting cases are presented. If you're interested in MIB and contactees and the so called \\"high strangeness\\" scenario's this may interest you. If you're looking for facts and information on the Mothman look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel used to be a well known investigator of the paranormal, an investigator of the non-sceptical variety. \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is his most famous work.The book has been marketed as the scariest thing ever written, but is actually quite bland compared to the accounts of alien abductions and 2012 apocalypses littering the bookstalls these days. But then, it was originally published in 1975.Personally, I consider the book to be a major disappointment. Keel comes across as paranoid, a kind of real life Fox Moulder. A mysterious dwarf with an eerie alien voice comes looking for him in West Virginia. The alien dwarf calls Keel in New York. Then, the phone just goes BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. The phone company can find no explanation. And so on. The whole thing is connected to sightings of \\"mothmen\\" in the small town of Point Pleasant in West Virginia (where else?). Does somebody want to scare him from continuing the investigation? The book contains no real answers, and ends abruptly when the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant collapses, killing 46 people. At that point, Keel is so paranoid and crazy, that he essentially collapses in front of his TV. There, the story ends.Unless I'm mistaken, Sceptical Enquirer actually named the mysterious dwarf some years ago. The dwarf was a real person, some kind of practical joker and circus artist who knew Keel personally. Apparently, this very real human being was responsible for many of the \\"paranormal\\" phenomena detailed by Keel. He drove poor John mad. Of course, Mr. Dwarf couldn't have been behind the mothmen or the collapse of the Silver Bridge.SO WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE LURKING OUT THERE...Last time I heard about Keel was during the 1990's. I believe he was interviewed by Strange Magazine, claiming that the UFO phenomenon was intrinsically EVIL. We have been warned.Incidentally, the movie \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" has only the flimsiest connection to the book. I suppose that's what Hollywood calls \\"freely based on a true story\\"."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"There are plenty of other more detailed reviews about the contents of this book. Let me just say it was entertaining and you have to suspend a lot of disbelief. However, what irritated me the most was \\"where the heck were all the photos\\"? Considering the amount of time Mr. Keel spent in West Virginia/Ohio area watching the skies I can not believe he NEVER took any photos. Granted a lot of time he spent watching and sighting was at night but they had film and cameras back in the early 70's that could handle night photography. There is mention of a an individual trying to do a documentary but the cameras would malfunction or the fim would not develop properly but I found this pretty lame. There are not even any photos of the town, landmarks, roads, witnesses or any physical evidence. I found this the most dissappointing of all. Photos would have made this extremely more credible book."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Really good read. Interesting, fact finding information was researched very well.Keeps you reading, not boring at all."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I have had this book before but lost it. I loved it the first time I read it, and having read it again, I still love it. It is a fascinating, thought provoking, and entertaining book. It's author, John Keel, has been my favorite author for the past four decades."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's \\"factual\\" account of the mysterious occurrences that took place in 1966 and 1967 in the small town of Point Pleasant, WV, is both eminently readable and genuinely creepy. Through extensive interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses, Keel compiles all the data and demonstrates the connection between the appearances of the Mothman (a winged, red-eyed, demon-like apparition terrorizing the Point Pleasant populace), a serious UFO flap taking place in the area at the same time, and veiled \\"warnings\\" of impending disaster that were being expressed to the witnesses of the above in dreams.The book does tend to jump around quite a bit as Keel intersperses other UFO reports and paranormal experiences in with the Point Pleasant data to make his points. The reader will have to pay attention in order to keep all of this straight.As in most cases, the book is far superior to the film of the same name. (The movie takes serious artistic license in many cases and even changes some of the important parts of the book.) It's obvious that Keel is passionate about this subject and that he has done his \\"homework\\". After reading \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\", you may never look at the nighttime sky in the same way again."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"As many of the other reviewers have said, this book isn't in chronological order nor does it put forth any kind of explanation for the mysterious events it describes - which I myself was rather disappointed by. You can catch glimpses of what Keel might be thinking from his comments throughout - enough to know, for example, that he doesn't buy the extraterrestrial invasion theory and that he thinks that the things people see are naturally occurring phenomena that most people just aren't aware of - but he never really sits down and explains it at length, despite the wealth of information he's gathered and thought about.However, the anecdotes and experiences presented were interesting - and by the sheer wealth and similarity of them, compelling. The nonlinear format might have helped to make it interesting in some ways, even if it distracted in others."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I just finished the Mothman and found it to be a very interesting account of a rash of strange sightings in the late 1960's, centered around a town called Point Pleasant. The tales of strange men in black unable to act and look fully human arriving on people's doorsteps is chilling to say the least. There are plenty of strange sightings and weirdness documented in this novel. I can't say I believe in UFO's or Mothmen but he makes an interesting case study of what happened back then, telling of the contactees from all walks of life who supposedly saw UFO's and the hi-jinks of otherworldly visitors after they reported it.Unfortunately, there is very little about the Mothman and at times, I felt frustrated since we didn't get quite as much of he/it as I would have liked. Still its a very interesting read, it kept me glued so I gave it five stars anyway. I still found it to be one of the more interesting of UFO literature. I liked the way he wrote this book in that you can detect a tone of skepticism as well as awe of the events. No one is sure what these things are but I liked what he wrote in the beginning on their possible origins which I won't give away. He writes with a lot of humour and its very well-written. I especially loved hearing about Woody's trip to Lanulos, an interplanetary nudist colony of sorts.All I can say is that I loved this book. Keel writes with a good eye and a sense of humour. Interesting events. Spooky and fun all at the same time."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I wasn't interested in seeing the movie but the idea of the book captivated me so I was pleased when it was re-released. Unfortunately, I found the book somewhat disappointing.The premise of Mothman Prophecies is interesting but the actual execution of the book doesn't live up to the promise of the subject matter. Keel tries to include too much information and too many diverse happenings. While everything in the book contributes to the premise - that strange things did indeed happen in West Virginia one year in the mid-sixties - he never really focuses on any one aspect. Mothmen are one of many phenomena he describes. And while he gives a great deal of background on the many phenomena, he never really lets us know what he thought caused the upheaval that year. There are many case studies but very few conclusions as to the cases he encounters first-hand. And when he does cite previous studies or encounters, his sources seem a little shaky. Citing established sources is one thing but citing what I would think of as fringe publications causes me to question the validity of both his conclusions and the original source material. I do, however, understand that legitimate, well done research is produced by less established organizations and publications.While there are flaws, Keel does make the book enjoyable. It could be dry and lifeless but he injects a good sense of humor into his study keeping the reader engaged. And while you may believe nothing about what he claims happened, he does make a strong case for himself. Its hard to avoid admitting that something outside our collective realms of experience happened that year."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I saw the film years ago and loved it. I've read most of the Mothman books, so I'm surprised that I always felt a strange mental block against reading this actual book for so long (Keel might have said this was the MIB putting a thought block in my head). I am an enormous lifelong fan of both horror/scifi and ufology, as well as cryptozoology. I give this book a highly favorable review for several reasons.First off, I completely agree with the reviewers who said the book is disjointed and has the feel of Keel having slapped together his notebooks. However, Keel has such an engaging prose and an ability to take an almost objective stand on this controversial stuff, that I never got confused. Part of Keel's art is that he thoroughly convinces the reader that he saw these things and furthermore believes most of the witnesses, yet just at the right points in the narrative, he interjects a comment to the effect that everyone has it all wrong, there are no UFOs (as people understand them) and much of it is really chicanery, enough so that the reader wonders what the truth is. Perhaps this tactic is appropriate: how can we know what is real and what is not? Keel certainly doesn't profess to, and he was apparently neck-deep in it.To fans of the Richard Gere/Laura Linney movie, note that there are many differences. But you probably expected that. Everyone knows Hollywood has to intertwine a romance into everything (and they do it quite well in the film, in my opinion). But in the end I found that the spirit and the terror of the movie are all in the book as well. I will truthfully admit that for two nights in a row, I was unable to sleep with the light off in my safe, suburban home with everyone around me. The climactic tumult revolving around the terrifying Mothman and the horrid sense of doom that Keel and other contactees felt during its reign in Point Pleasant, WV prevented me from sleeping in the dark. If you love suspense and foreboding, inexplicable horror, this book ought to be a gem for you. I could not get out of my head the account of a teenage girl who saw a grinning man standing over her bed in the middle of the night!The second half is very much a delving into Keel's personal world of madness. After establishing the connection between UFOs, Mothman and mysterious Men in Black, Keel's world unravels. Suffice it to say that he feels he is being pursued and harangued relentlessly by the Men in Black. Paranoia? Draw your own conclusions.On a personal note, I was astounded and overwhelmed with excitement to see how much my native Long Island, NY figured into this book. I always assumed it would take place only in WV, but Keel actually lives in Manhattan and takes frequent trips out not just to the Island, but to my hometown of Huntington, where local legend Sweet Hollow Road and Mt. Misery figures prominently into the web of confusion spun by the ETs. Having been to that site many, many times and experienced the powerful fear in the air there, this book was sealed in my psyche as a great Fortean read.Enjoy \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\". Don't blame me if you have to sleep with a nightlight on and the curtains drawn."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is amazing! It was not at all like I expected. I saw the movie in 2003 and enjoyed it, so when I picked up the book this year I figured it would be as good or as always better. I thought it would center on a few Moth man sightings. I was very surprised to find out that it was more about UFO visitations, abductions, Men In Black, time travel, strange visitors, conspiracy theories and strange phone calls. The Mothman was only a sideshow to the main attraction! As I said in the title of the review, it is like reading the diary of a madman. You start reading and you can't believe what you are reading is supposed to be a true story. It sucks you in and you go on and on in search of answers that the author is so franticly looking for. It is disjointed and jumps around but I believe it ads a little flair to the style. I highly recomend this book and I can't wait to read John Keel's other work! I also hope someone remakes the movie as well. Not that the 2001 movie is bad, but if someone followed the book closer, the movie would make the film 12 Monkeys look soft in comparison!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"After watching the movie and being substantially moved by the piece, I decided to purchase the book and look further into the phenomeneon of the 'Mothman', and to be honest I was a little dissappointed.Although able to go places the movie was not able, providing large amounts of data and witness reports of UFO activity and MIB appearances, it seemed to lack something. The title subject of the 'Mothman' was glazed over a bit and seemingly took a back seat to the other Phenomenon that Keel investigates.I was able to move through the book at a rapid pace though, surprisingly helped by Keel's narative method of splitting the chapters into sub-chapters of no relationship. Keel does enough work to build the witness reports of those he interviews and his own eye-witness testimony, to a level by which one can only really believe them, crucial in this genre.At the end of the day 'The Mothman Prophecies' was an entertaining read that certainly leaves the reader with more questions than answers, as every good book should do. If you are looking for 'truth' then perhaps look elsewhere but, highly recommended for cold, wet nights"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel did an absolutely terrific job, researching, developing and organizing this story. I purchased the original release and read it the same day. Overwhelmed would be a good term to use here, the book encompassed all aspects of the case.Was Mothman real, imaginary or a paranormal entity ? Did Mothman truly have something to do with the collapse of the Silver Bridge? And have we seen or heard the last of Mothman? Some of these answer you may find in &quot;Mothman Prophecies&quot; if you look hard enough. Easy, enjoyable read, better than the movie !"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's ideas (now much repeated by the paranormal crowd) center around a sort of deconstructionist/quantum physics attitude applied to supernatural phenomenon.I like the creepiness, and I like how from the very beginning, Keel describes that creepiness is relative.All manner of weird things happen to poor John on his quest to find the Mothman, a large, winged being haunting Point Pleasant, W.Va., just across the river from Ohio. The process of investigation leads to Men In Black, hairy hominids, ufos and other odd flying machines and Keel leads us to believe that this bizarre process happens with every such investigation. Wild!The other great thing about the Mothman Prophecies is that the story is an arc with a beginning, a middle, and a tragic (and frightening) end. Unlike many paranormal books, Keel dosen't wade into the material as a believer. He is in disbelief even as he reveals his strange facts."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel's tome regarding the Mothman has nothing to do with the film (ok, I'm nitpicking)...more to the point, it involves itself not only with the events in West Virginia, but, also with events on Long Island and other locales.THIS IS NOT A NARRATIVE.At least, not in the normal sense. It's a story of one man's journey from skeptic to the other side....by the end of the book, Keel is not necessarily a stone believer, but he is a stone paranoid, which amounts to the same thing. He goes into the book carrying one belief system and walks out of it with quite another.This, I feel, is the actual appeal of the book. We get to witness not the transformation of a character, but the transformation of the author, which makes this not only a fascinating study, but a dangerous book indeed.And why is it dangerous? Because a researcher changed his mind? No, it is dangerous because the researcher had CREDENTIALS beforehand...he's a scholar. If Gore Vidal (the historian) told you that in his research for \\"Lincoln\\" he discovered that Lincoln liked to savage rabbits with his bare hands...would you believe me?Of course not...but the problem here is that there is no historical record to go on, that if we are to believe, we believe on the basis of our judgment of a man's character.That said, I believe he is telling the truth. I have read not only the book in question, but many other works by Keel, and I believe him to be sane. Naive, yes, often. But always he thinks about his topic. This educated man experienced something back in 1967. The question is : should we accept his account of events?I personally say yes, but that is an answer rising from years of \\"ufo's exist...\\" upbringing, along with my religious convictions.I leave it up to you.The point is, this is a book that needs to be taken not with a grain of salt, but with a full salt lick in front of you. The facts presented are merely things to be looked at more carefully. Here's hoping you do just that. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book isn't only about Mothman but also UFO, mystery lights, skin burns and such. It's pretty interesting, the retelling of the mysteriuos events, but Keel doesn't sensationize them, which leads to a fairly dry book. You can see why he stands out in his field, he's experienced these things but doesn't over embelish, draw conclusions, or try to start a religion of belief, just says this happened, and this, and that, and so on. So, while I liked the 'hard' facts, it's told in a way that loses interest. Also in the telling, he 'jumps' around a lot, here's one on day 1, here's one on day 20, here's a continuation of day 1 on day 5, etc. It's hard to stay focused on what's happening or what he is trying to do. It's not a bad book, just depends on what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Never mind the nattering naybobs of negativity, this book is a classic. Why does Keel go into so many other subjects? Because the Mothman case he worked on was not an isolated &quot;monster&quot; invasion but an outbreak of various strange phenomena that had at its center recorded sightings of an unidentified winged creature dubbed the &quot;mothman.&quot; These sightings were part of a larger picture. Keel tells a complicated tale that requires some intelligence and imagination to understand. Without his various sidetrips there is no connection with the bridge collapse and hence no story or drama other than the individual encounters with the apparition. The movie was good but it dramatized the actual events for the sake of making a more cohesive story, just as all other movies based on books do. Take any book based on historical events and make a fiction film out of it and you'll find that certain distoritions must occur. You can't go back and blame history just because it isn't as thrilling and manipulated as fiction."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this &quot;nonfiction&quot; book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Let me just start by saying that the &quot; MOTHMAN PROPHECIES&quot; is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story.

Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters. There is not an ounce of structure to this. It's just a bunch of thoughts and \\"reports\\" of sightings of UFO's, \\"mothmen\\" and other oddities. I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel. I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance. All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!?!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's \\"weird\\" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.\\"Mothman\\" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I. HISTORY A lot of &quot;the unexplained&quot; books today got their inspiration from pioneer books like this one. I read this book several times in middle school &amp; now many (though not all) of its theories have been confirmed with the knowledge I possess today. NOT recommended for immature readers.II. PLOT Keel's bold &quot;documentary&quot; not only grips the reader because the physical events ACTUALLY occurred, but also because the book was written during a time when MIBs, aliens, &amp; &quot;mystery monsters&quot; were politically INcorrect. Now everyone is jumping on the &quot;UFO&quot; bandwagon.III. CHARACTERS The characters *are* or *were* real. Although Keel was a UFO journalist &amp; therefore has a biased view, the events, interviews &amp; conversations actually occurred AND he was there when much of it happened.IV. THE UNEXPLAINED Keel offers a refreshing hypothesis behind the nature of the &quot;unexplained&quot; &amp; &quot;unscientific&quot; events which STILL occur. Although *many* components of his theory are off-key, his theories including the observations that UFOs are &quot;primarily psychic in nature&quot; &amp; come from &quot;inner space vs. outer space&quot; are not far off base. And Keel is a nonChristian!V. REALITY WAKE UP AMERICA &amp; skeptics! Even the Bible &amp; world religions (which DON'T support the Bible) testify to this. If modern-day mediums can conjur up spirits, if psychics have &quot;spirit guides&quot; that tell you your personal 411 when many of you dial the psychic hotline, if Tibetan monks can create &quot;tulpas&quot; or manifested thought-forms, if cameras suddenly jam when &quot;mystery creatures&quot; are about to be photographed &amp; UFOs can alter human consciousness, then maybe their nature IS more non-physical than physical. And maybe DUH!, they ARE similar in origin.Final thought: A person that only reads books on what they already know is *wasting their time.*"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I'll admit it, I didn't have a clue what was going on in this book (which claims to be real, but is obviously a work of fiction), nor did I really have much of a reason to.UFOs...Men in black...Mothmen...Abductees...government coverups...sightings...It's all here, and regardless makes no sense whatsoever.I actually walked into this thinking it was going to be great, that there would be a wonderful story based upon the legend of the mothman, but no I was bombarded with 266 pages of &quot;research&quot; having no really meaning, or thesis. Honestly, I say avoid this like the plague."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Well John boy at least got to have a movie made from his book, so I guess he died happy, knowing he was able to use double talk and vague if not downright deceptive practice's to pull the wool over the ufonut communities eyes.(Keel tosses out the tidbit that this part of America was NEVER settled by native Americans while all areas around it were. Bull, this part of West Virginia was HEAVILY lived in and settled by indians)OK so here it is. Mothman has nothing better to do than fly around a remote area of the Ohio Valley in 1966-7 and then make a bridge collapse. There are 50 states and millions of people that mothman could have messed with, but he decides to pick on poor 'ol West Virginia.We're lucky though, because John Keel is on the case, and those mean, evil, nasty, bad guy/monster's don't know who they're dealing with.So here we have Mr Keel and he is an expert in all thing's paranormal, and he can't get one simple photograph of all those light's he saw while in West Virginia? John Keel want's the reader to see that it's ALL about HIM and we listen to his stories about the phone taps and the men in black and we can't get a single thing in writing from the phone company to confirm his phone problems, and despite being in an area of the country that has a heavily armed private citizenry, not one of those Asian looking men in black is shot or held at gun point while the local police are called. Hmm?We are regaled of the nightly ufo flights that John sees, but not a single photo. John tells of a movie maker who comes down to film, but you guessed it. No photo's. Those insedious mothmen seem to destroy every picture taken of them. They tease us with \\"accurate\\" predictions, only to give us lies later on. The fact that all we have is John Keel's word about the accurate predictions, since we only get them AFTER the fact, leaves a bit much to the credulity of the reader.John gives us his ideas about the different dimensions that things exist on and says that mothman comes from there. We are given his expertise on what is real and what isn't. Once again we are required to assume that John is an honest broker. Sorry, don't buy it.This book takes place in 1966-67 and wasn't first published until 1973. We had to wait for Richard Gere and his movie to come out before the story came back on the public radar and we got the book re-issued.Needless to say most of the things Mr. Keel claims to be true cannot be verified by any independent source or source's. After all this time an industry has grown up around mothman and where there is money to be made, you can bet that a small thing such as the truth or facts are quickly destroyed on the altar of commerce and glitz.How any sane or rational person can read this book and buy into it without ANY reservation says something about the kind of people we have in the world today. I wish mothman would come and get them."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying &quot;distracted&quot; attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an &quot;investigator&quot; he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Although I realize at the time it was written, politically correct descriptions of people were not the same as today, yet some of these things are too strong to be overlooked. The following descriptions are honestly found in the book:negroids or colored persondescribing a gay men as a sexual deviantall small town cops have pot belliesmost contactees are poorly read (the West Virginian residents)craggy foreign facethey were foreigners, you know, Japs or somethingmen in formal suits and ties were never seen in West Virginia before his arrivaldreary coal mining towns of Appalachia where he suggests the people are hillbilliesfrail sparrowlike women I usually see in Appalachiarapid fire language that sounded like Spanish\\"cocoa\\" cola bottleI give the book merits on the fierce and intense research Mr. Keel put into the book, and it is more entertaining than I thought it would be. However, other points that need to be identified are: He finds strange pieces of wood in people's phones, people who claim their phones are bugged, but he doesn't keep the strange object? He sits in his car and witness several UFO going overhead, with a film camera beside him, yet forgot to take any footage. A UFO comes within yards of him and some viewers and he shines a \\"spotlight\\" on them (so convenient he just happened to have one handy), the UFO takes off and the only thing he can say was \\"guess I blew it\\" when most people would be on their knees in astonishment. He claims to have kept these facts secret until the publishing of the book, so as to not create hoaxers. He waited to published the book after the bridge collapse?If John Keel was selected to be a contactee as he claims. Then why did he get such laughable feedback from the aliens? Wouldn't the aliens be technologically advanced, much more than earthlings. Then how come they failed to know there are more than 9 planets in our solar system and other heavenly bodies in it as well. Why did the UFO's have \\"frosted glass\\" windows and bucket seats? Such a painstakingly tacky reminder of the period in which the book was written. A definite retro look. Why would the aliens refer to phonographic records? They could travel thru time but their most advanced technology was a record? The aliens photographed people and houses with huge cameras with huge lights on them, yet a mere 30 years later we have cameras the size of pencils. The part about the high starch diets touched a nerve as far as contactees craving starch, and when he explains the alien voices that sound like records being played too fast is because of the time contiuum they are challenged with was really well thought out..this book was written in the era of hallucinatory drugs and the acid craze..could explain a lot of the hallucinations. One person saw a \\"blob\\" floating over their house, yet no other description is added. And finally, the chapter about Princess Moon Owl is where the book starts to fall apart. But hold on, if you keep reading it is all worth it, when he gets to the bridge collapse, which is brilliantly written.All I am saying is Mr. Keel admits that as a hobby he enjoys performing magic tricks and parlor games (aimed at deceiving people).You think I am here to debunk him, but I am not. One of the events described in the book actaully happened to me and I had never known there were others who experienced it as well."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The book is a disjointed account of many &quot;sightings&quot; of different phenomena. It does mke me want to see how this was pulled off in a movie."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Overall this was an entertaining and thought provoking book. Very little is mentioned about the mothman compared to UFOs, MIB, stange lights and cattle mutations. I did find Keels thoughts on vampires, angels and UFOs being all from the same entity very interesting. I kept finding myself wondering if Keel was overly paranoid, however this may well be the point. Are all people who encounter UFO's paranoid or are there powers at work that make them and us think they are paranoid? Now, I'm sounding paranoid! Because of this book, I will continue to read on UFO's , and for that reason I liked the book."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Good read. If half of what is written in this book is true; then are world is much stranger than we can imagine.One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John A. Keel has been around a long time and I personally think he is one of the most underrated authors of this century. He tells of emotions felt while experiences are taking place as they happened which is really a missed factor in writing now-a-days. Skeptics hate this book down to the cover dismissing it as unbelieveable, yet, none of the information in the book has been explained yet."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Although I prefer books with an actual plot, I don't mind reading choppy, journal-type entries if there is actually a point to all of it, or if at least such entries are entertaining. This book's are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title. There's hardly anything about &quot;the mothman&quot; in it."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you liked the movie, don't buy this book! It was the worst compilation of meandering thoughts that I have read since, well, since ever. This book left me wondering: &quot;Huh?! What were you thinking?!&quot;But, if you are the ever true believer in MIB (not the movie), black helicoptors, and cow mutilations, this just may be the book for you. If you will accept an explaination for parnormal events, presented in a matter of fact form, as truth, without further explaination as to how such conclusions are reached, then you will accept, probably love, this book. However, for me, a reasonable person, wishing for education, not blanket belief, this book is nothing more than a waste of money. I would gladly send you, dear reader, this book for free, saving you the cost of purchase, but the shipping fee is too great a cost, considering that I may use the book for fuel for a fire to warm me on a cold winters night...It reminds me of the great words of Eric Cartman: &quot;Well, they took me up in their spaceship, and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye&quot;. Your pinkeye, Mr. Keel, was probably caused by rubbing your eyes too much...trying to stay awake while creating such garbage."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman.

Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, \\"ufo\\" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This is a thorough, thought-provoking narrative of Mr. Keel's investigation in the late 1960's of a rash of UFO, &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;MIB&quot; reports in and around Pt. Pleasant, WV. The reader is presented with an almost journalistic accounting, relatively free of the bias, presupposition or fanaticism that tends to characterize this genre. Particularly impressive is the attention given to historical precedents and similar themes found throughout human myth and legend"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies opens with a mysterious event--an unusual-looking stranger knocks on a door in rural West Virginia during a storm to ask to use a phone. The couple who live in the house can't help him--and three weeks later both are victims of the Silver Bridge collapse. A visit from the devil, one of his minions, or the angel of death? No. As it turns out, it was Keel himself, stranded and looking for assistance. This first anecdote shows how easy it is for superstitious people to misinterpret an ordinary event.Most of The Mothman Prophecies consists of such anecdotes, some with explanations, many without. Many, not all, occur in the Ohio valley area centering on Point Pleasant, the focal point of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings, Point Pleasant was located on the West Virginia side of the Silver Bridge, which collapsed on December 15, 1967, due to a combination of factors, including heavy, backed-up traffic and a flawed piece of steel, the failure of which triggered the bridge's collapse.Keel cleverly builds on anecdote after anecdote. Even if some are questionable or unbelievable, they all can't be, or that seems to be his rationale. Dozens of witnesses can't be mistaken, lying, or paranoid. For the susceptible, this accumulation of horror stories makes this a frightening book. Some of those people, including Keel himself, must have seen something--from the strangely moving lights in the sky to the aerodynamically impossible \\"Mothman,\\" which doesn't flap its apparently unnecessary wings but flies straight up like a helicopter.Keel decries \\"self-style investigators\\" and believes himself to be a thorough professional. Yet his reporting, whether first- or second-hand, is full of holes. He tells of an odd stranger with \\"thyroid eyes\\" (a common feature of these sightings) who comes into a fashionable New York City watering hole but can't read the menu and doesn't know how to cut or eat a steak. He tells the waitress he's from \\"another world.\\" That is where Keel leaves the story, \\"a stranger in a strange land,\\" with some seemingly trivial but critical questions unasked and unanswered, such as: Did he understand what the check was? How did he pay? Did he know to leave a tip? If so, did he leave an appropriate one? Where did he keep his money and what condition was it in? Without answers to those questions--things that a waitress would easily remember--her assessment that he's \\"another put-on artist\\" seems most likely.He visits a farm where, coincidentally, the farmer has seen a UFO that frightened his cows off (in another anecdote, the exposed cows are found dead), burns out a piece of electrical equipment, and leaves behind a \\"fairy circle.\\" All this is so familiar to Keel that he doesn't bring in someone to perform chemical analyses to see, for example, if there is any kind of residue in the circle that would help to explain its cause. The opportunity seems to be deliberately missed.Conveniently, Keel's \\"ultra-dimensional beings\\" operate in a way that precludes independent verification of their existence. Cameras and film malfunction. Supporting witnesses are rendered unconscious or develop amnesia. While Keel believes these beings are interested in him, they contact him primarily through third parties whose reliability is questionable. When \\"Jane\\" reports that an envelope he sent was tampered with in the mail, he never considers the possibility that this woman, whose behavior is odd, is telling him what he wants to hear.The beings also control the behavior of contactees. Dozens of \\"Orientals\\" with \\"sharp features\\" (since when do Asians have \\"sharp features\\"?) and \\"thyroid eyes\\" are invited into homes for hours at a time, and their questions about personal matters are answered freely. Personally, I don't know anyone who would do this.\\"Jane\\" obligingly takes pills provided by her contacts,which make her ill and which prove to be an ordinary sulfa drug. Other people don't hesitate to climb aboard alien ships. Perhaps most telling, many of the descriptions are vague and refer to contemporary fixtures and technology. \\"Frosted glass\\" is one of the few details provided, and \\"Men in Black,\\" who are smart enough to produced unissued license plate numbers but not smart enough to obtain late-model vehicles, use the same kind of camera and clunky flash available to 1960s reporters.Keel cites a conversation with Gray Barker, who claimed not to have spoken with him on that occasion; Barker was later proven to be a hoaxer, and witnesses claimed that he did make the call while drunk. In fact, between \\"Jane's\\" assertions, Keel's stretched association of \\"A Pal\\" with \\"Apholes,\\" and his phone troubles, he seems to have become a paranoiac by the end. He even determines that the phone company is tapping his phone, but doesn't explain why.He assesses the reliability of each of his witnesses, but he is not reliable. For example, he discusses a map developed by anthropologists that shows that Indians avoided West Virginia. Keel doesn't provide a source, which makes it difficult to verify this assertion. Of course, there were Indians in West Virginia, despite his claim.The Mothman Prophecies is entertaining, and Keel tries to make the cumulative evidence compelling. The \\"facts\\" are not always accurate, the witnesses are not reliable (\\"Jane,\\" his favorite, least of all), and questions are not raised or answered.In 2007, do \\"ultra-dimensional beings\\" tap into digital phones? VOIP? Mobiles? E-mail? Instant messages? Digital cable? Have they adapted to today's technology? The anxieties that underlie The Mothman Prophecies seem to reflect those of the times--the fears surrounding the Cold War, Eisenhower's \\"military-industrial complex,\\" and big government. The Mothman Prophecies is a manifestation of the troubled times in which it was set. Today's \\"Mothman\\" or \\"Indrid Cold\\" might be very different creatures indeed.Diane Schirf15 April 2007."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"In order to comprehend the TRUE nature of All of the incidents of the paranormal (from Mothman to automatic writing) one could do no better than to read ALL of Keel's writings. UFOs are not ships from other planets (they're not &quot;false sightings&quot;, either) and big hairy monsters are not unknown biological life forms (yes, they are real and not &quot;mistaken sightings&quot;.) Keel demonstrates the nexus extant between all sectors of the paranormal -- between clairvoyants, ufos, monsters, demonic possession, possessed individuals, demons, MIBs, ghosts, and much more. As a former journalist, he knows the correct questions to ask which is mandatory in obtaining the correct answers to expose any mystery. The claims he made decades ago, which may seem impossible, are being endorsed by quantum physics today -- not that ufos or bigfeet exist but that the nature of space and time (referred to as &quot;spacetime&quot; in physics) is such that they are allowed, in the laws of nature, to exist -- quantum reality or the reality extant at, if not beneath, the subatomic level. We perceive only a very small modicum of reality, as there is a helluva lot more to it than we could ever perceive. The ultimate question is: who, or what, exists over there and do they perceive us?"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is a great book. Even though the book isn't very organized, if you look hard enough, you gain somewhat of an understanding about the FBI, MIB (Men in Black), the mothman and other paranormal creatures. This book tells the stories of the people that live in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, who are witnesses to the Mothman and UFO's. Throughout this book John A. Keel gets off the subject and sometimes the book doesn't always make sense. But, don't let that bother you. Despite the fact that this book has no point and is plotless it is still a great book. It's a suspenseful page-turner and even leaves you questioning which stories were real and which stories weren't."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"It is worth noting that Keel wrote about Mothman just a few years before this book came out. A chapter in &quot;The Complete Guide To Mysterious Beings&quot; (1970) is devoted to the Point Pleasant phenomena. While Keel describes the various interviews he conducted with witnesses, at this point he doesn't involve himself in the story at all. He never indicates that he experienced any of these things himself. It was only later that he apparently had the idea of crafting a Mothman story with himself as the central character.Even more notable, in &quot;Mysterious Beings,&quot; Keel draws no connections between Mothman and the bridge collapse. In fact, he specifically says, &quot;It is completely erroneous to blame the collapse of the rickety old Silver Bridge on flying saucers or 'Men In Black.'&quot;This represents direct evidence (something Keel never seems to have) that we are simply not dealing with a researcher or a journalist, as Keel so often claims to be. He is a clever storyteller. Nothing more. I know the stories seem much more exciting when you think they're true, and in the middle of the night, even I get creeped out thinking about Mothman. But the story is flimsy and transparent when held up to the light of day.I loved the movie though!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Keel is a true investigator. He leaves no path untread upon in his search for the truth behind the UFO phenomenon. His countless accounts of the Men in Black and their games will inform you as to their place in all of this, frighten you and even make you laugh out loud. His work helps defend the theory that aliens are inter-dimensional rather than extra-terrestrial.Even if you are not a UFO buff, this is a smooth, yet thorough induction into this strange and all too close world. Even for you non-believers, the connections made in this book will at the very least gnaw at you and most definately entertain you.I've probably read over a hundred books on paranormal and UFOs and still have them. I found 'Alien Agenda' by Marrs and 'Alien Rapture by Fouche - Steiger to be my favorites, and I have read them more than once.

This story is more compelling than anything Hollywood could make up."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book was originally published by Saturday Review Press in 1975 and languished thereafter. &quot;Ufology&quot; meanwhile careened into the mad pursuit of red herrings such as Roswell, the MJ-12 documents, the John Lear hypothesis, abduction &quot;research,&quot; etc. (basically the basis of the &quot;X files&quot;) and in the process has reverted to its infancy babbling about crashed saucers, little dead aliens in Hanger 14, and aliens in underground bases (although back then they were called &quot;Deros&quot;). The disinformation boys much be laughing themselves sick, I hope their getting a percentage of the movie and TV revenue.Illuminet brought it back (along with companion volume OPERATION UFO) several years back. Apparently the message is not much more popular. To those who, like Mulder, &quot;want to believe&quot; Keel says starkly &quot;belief is the enemy.&quot; To skeptics want to disbelieve, Keel presents a deeper skepticism, not only of reality status, but of meaning. (Just because an entity exists doesn't mean it won't mess with your head.) To those self-styled &quot;responsible ufo researches&quot; who mutter about &quot;explain one unknown with another&quot; and the need for &quot;Ockham's razor&quot; Keel's attempt at explanations are no more strange than the phenomenon itself--sometimes the *only* way to explain an unknown is with another unknown. This book has something to offend just about every &quot;camp&quot; therefore only individual free thinkers can appreciate it.Choppy? Yeah, I guess. But it should be read in conjunction with TROJAN HORSE and the EIGHTH TOWER, which includes material left out of MOTHMAN.Is he lying? Maybe. But more respectable ufologist (whatever that means) like Jenny Randles in PENNINE UFO MYSTERY, Jacques Vallee in CONFRONTATIONS, and Halliday &amp; Pugh in the DYFED ENGIMA, report many of the same strange happenings (though not *all* of them at the same time and not as intensely).Finally they should consult UFO DYNAMICS by Berthold Schwarz for an even more thoroughly document work on the psychic aspects of the phenomenon.Keel speculates at times. But *nobody* has better gut hunches and when he reports his own experiences and those of others he's interviewed he's rock solid. Sometimes when he veers off into ancient astronauts like wool gathering he's weak. But in this book it's at a minimum.Truly scary.

There were complaints that there were only 10 pages contributed to the actual mothman.The bottom line - the read was meant to be more informative than to be outlined as a plot and resolution, or an embellished story. The reader is left to formulate their own conclusions.I have no problem with the format, I read it as a non-fiction work. I liked the read, I liked the movie, though they were entirely different, but aren't they all?"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book, to me, starts out a little slow, in that the author focuses solely on THE mothman and peoples' accounts with him (what he looked like, did, etc.). For about the first 100 pages the author pretty much lists interviews and 1st hand accounts with contactees and their experiences. Though, after the 100th page or so (I don't know what it is about the 100th page for me), the book gets really interesting. Things start happening personally to John Keel himself. It seems as though, the more he begins to find out, and the deeper he goes into things, the more things begin to get in his way and stop him. It becomes apparent that someone or something doesn't want him to know what he knows.. Yet he persists. A very good book which lives up to its name."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is a book by author John A. Keel which claims to tell the true story of mysterious events occurring in the eastern United States during the late 1960s. The tale is told entirely from Keel's vantage point as a first-hand investigator (and experiencer) of the paranormal happenings in question.I must say that I began reading The Mothman Prophecies with certain expectations. I had previously been exposed to the exploits of the infamous mothman by various authors in other cryptozoology texts. There was no question that this book would be the authoritative, original source material from which most other writers have since taken inspiration. I was surprised, however, at the diversity of the matter which awaited me.On the positive side, Keel is an excellent and engaging author. He writes colorfully, and offers a work that will not likely bore any of his audience. It's also nearly impossible to argue that this story isn't a \\"must read\\" for those interested in the Mothman, or any of the number of other strange incidents which Keel documents here. Having had the unique privilege of investigating and experiencing these events in person, as they were happening, the author boasts a definite authority and purity in documentation. It's obvious that The Mothman Prophecies has heavily influenced many modern researchers in various fields of the unexplained, making it an entry hard to ignore on any serious paranormalist's reading list. I must also say that, even if one were to discount its potential as a true story, the book does make a fairly good classic sci-fi page turner in its own right.Enjoyment and intrigue aside, I did develop some rather serious criticisms of The Mothman Prophecies which I feel could negatively impact some readers. As with most texts, the degree to which these cons influence your personal experience will vary.First off, Keel blatantly and repeatedly breaks one of the cardinal rules of good scientific documentation; he continuously introduces theories and opinions into his writing. The Mothman Prophecies is laced with personal interpretations of the phenomena being witnessed. In fact, something that really surprised me on several occasions, were the seamless way in which the author would offer what are essentially his beliefs as solid fact, with nary a disclaimer. It's not uncommon for paranormal investigators to attempt to draw conclusions from their works, but this goes well beyond that. Keels repeatedly debunks and downplays certain popular institutions, including UFO groups and alien visitation theories, while simultaneously replacing them with his own views. He ironically disclaims one ideology as being scientifically unsupportable, while concurrently supplanting it with his own, equally unsupported, theories. Keel regularly writes in a very matter-of-fact manner with explanations for curiosities that I do not believe have ever been accounted for scientifically, even to this day.The lack of good scientific method is also not limited to the frequent disclosure of Keel's convictions. I additionally found myself curious how someone as dedicated to investigating the paranormal as the author must have been, could still be so unprepared to gather any data other than witness statements and personal observations. Throughout the book, Keel documents a multitude of occasions where he witnessed anomalous objects and individuals, both by chance and by intent. All this time, he never mentions taking a single photograph or measurement of those in question. In one chapter, we hear how he repeatedly visits a certain hilltop at night to view a recurring colorful orb in the distance, yet he apparently never thought to take photographs, nor to simply go and wait in the location where these lights actually appeared. His lack of ability to take advantage of the seemingly ubiquitous and predictable phenomena makes the sheer legitimacy of some of the accounts suspect.Getting back to expectations, having already learned of the Mothman character from other sources, I had come into The Mothman Prophecies expecting to read an exhaustive, authoritative volume of documentation on one of my personal favorite cryptids. I was rather surprised to discover, then, that the Mothman creature really only plays a limited roll in the proceedings. This book is absolutely not the standard investigators report that one might expect to find on other monsters such as Sasquatch or Nessie. Mothman here is little more than a supporting character in a large cast of humans, weirdos, monsters, and anomalous objects. The majority of the book, particularly the latter half, is actually spent away from the Mothman, and enters into a huge variety of lights in the sky, men-in-black, UFO contactees, phone tapping, and lots of miscellaneous strangeness. In fact, Keel relates such a variety of bizarre happenings from this period in his life, that it may greatly strain ones ability to believe that the story is the least bit sane and true. The author, rather than being the normal independent observer, actually becomes the central character in what would more easily be viewed as an old school sci-fi tale, had the cover of the book not disclaimed it to be \\"based on a true events.\\"My final gripe, although smaller than the aforementioned bits, is that the writing style here has a tendency to be disjointed. Characters seem to pop up in various chapters, often for only a paragraph or two at a time. It makes remembering exactly who is where and doing what across chapters more confusing than it should be, and occasionally detracts from the ability to follow the overall story. The chapters, likewise, are somewhat hit or miss. They don't seem to follow any specific convention, some based on people, others on a block of time, and still others on a specific phenomena. The chapters themselves are also subdivided into numbered sections, in a way which at times felt arbitrary and pointless. While there are no doubt multiple ways to tell a complex and chronological story of this nature, it would have been nice had the author and editors simply picked one theme and stuck with it.Ultimately, The Mothman Prophecies is an interesting work, to say the least. If you want a good paranormal story, you certainly need to look no further. Additionally, if you're in the market for a first-hand account of the origin of the Mothman or even the other paranormal events around Point Pleasant in the late 1960s, this is really a must read. On the other hand, if you're a scientifically minded individual looking for responsible investigation of the unexplained, you're likely to be disappointed by Keel's very human (and very biased) manner of recounting events, which greatly stains belief and credibility.Rating: 3.5/5--Matt LaPlante8/3/2008"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The book is the first book I completed on the topic of UFOs and high strangeness in general. I read this book at night before going to sleep. It was hard to put down for a couple reasons - it scaried me awake so I couldn't sleep, the story was an interesting mystery, and I felt I had to finish it as soon as possible so that the uneasy feeling I had at the time would go away. With that said I still suggest people read it, since the spookiness around the world seems to be increasing. Also, the book is far superior in my opinion as compared to the movie, so I suggest the book first then the movie."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This was a very fascinating read. It does not focus only on Mothamn sightings, but all the other strange events that were supposed to have happened. If you are looking for a book that will prove Mothman exists, I don't think this is the proper book for you. It is mainly about what went on from the first sighting of Mothman to the felling of the bridge. There were a lot of strange happenings during that time. I read this as \\"I'm presenting you with the information as to what heppened as I saw it and was involved in it, and you make up your mind as to whether its true or not\\"."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I bought and reread this book that I read years ago. I still liked it. If you want a Novel or Liked the movie you might not like this book. The book isn't written that way and novel reads. you are a novel reader you may find it harder to follow and get lost by the end. It isn't a smooth read beause it's written more real life. Real life isn't a smooth read. If you want a first hand account by a investigator who was trying not to loose objectivity then you will like it. The people who might not like it are those readers who con't see a connection between UFO, Bigfoot or other strange creatures, Ghost &amp; poltergeist phenomena. You won't see the writer trying to comunticate with undead spirits or make peace with extraterestirals. You will find an investigator who noticed that ufo sights seem to corispond with poltergiest and other supernatural activity."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is not what I expected at all. I picked up the book after I saw the movie. It turns out that the movie is a fictional story based on the mothman. In this book, author John Keel tells his stories of traveling around the east cost areas and, well, UFO hunts. It is very creepy the stories he has to tell and the fact that thousands have witnessed what he is writing about. This is a very fun, and creepy book. It will leave you stirring in your sleep."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Usually with any book I can just jump on and write up a review as soon as I'm done reading. The Mothman Prophecies was a little more in depth to do such a thing, so it's taken me a little longer. I am one of those who has read the book and not seen the movie, so hopefully I'll give you some better insight than those who saw the movie first, then read the book. I'll give this review my best shot.This is the classic \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" type book. There's maybe 1 chapter on Mothman himself. There may seem to be no plot, but from what I got from the book, the plot is that Mothman was the base of the largest UFO \\"outbreak\\" in modern history. Keel goes on to describe how weird just go weirder. You must read this with an open mind in able to enjoy it. You can't start out with an open mind, and then shut it, because it'll be no good. Wait until you're done with the book before you say its trash. Certain things towards the end will perk you up.The book isn't very well organized. I am very disappointed with this. Keel has way too many witnesses in able to be doing this, and it will screw you up at times. You may want to take gradual notes while reading just so you can go back and say, \\"Okay, now who was Jayes again?\\"Keel also admits that this book was the first time that he let some information out as to techniques used, similarities in witnesses, etc. All of these things are pretty much known today, being that the book was published in 1975.As far as \\"proof\\" goes... Nobody has proof, as far as I know, that extraterrestrials are really out there. Everyone who writes books on them are using THEIR ideas/theories. To me, John Keel has some better theories than a lot of writers out there.If you want to hear plenty of accounts with UFO's and Men in Black involved, this is the book that you want. There are more stories in this book than I can even think of right now! Be sure to pick it up. Either you'll like it or you won't.~Natalie Kilpatrick"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel, like Jacques Vallee, is one of those UFO writers who obscures as much as he enlightens. Both men have a tendency to describe unquestionably physically real occurrences (smashed objects, landing traces, radiation effects), and then to try and dismiss them as some unfathomable &quot;ultradimensional&quot; phenomenon.Still, Keel was at Point Pleasant during the 1966-67 UFO flap, of which Mothman was a part, and one doesn't have to buy his specious analyses to appreciate his simple good factual reporting. The best part of this book isn't even the reports of Mothman, but of all the other bizarre related UFO occurrences that came with him. This is one of the best books available discussing Men In Black, though typically Keel attempts to fit them into part of the &quot;ultradimensional&quot; view instead of applying Occam's Razor and calling them for what they most appear to be: government goons.In conjunction with the movie, Keel was part of an FX T.V. special returning to Point Pleasant for a followup, which is quite interesting if you ever get a chance to see it. The movie covers only about ten percent of Keel's UFO coverage in the book.In a new afterword, Keel oddly attempts to dismiss much UFO phenomena even as he is blatantly discussing it throughout his text, and for some reason calls the famous 1989 Voronezh sightings a Cold War hoax without once citing any source - I am an author in this field, keep pretty up to date, and have never once heard Voronezh even accused of being any kind of hoax. One does wish Keel would be a little less loose slinging broad, generalized accusations."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John A. Keel's The Mothman Prophecies, as a book, is just as intriguing and mysterious as the topics he is writing about. In a nutshell, the book reads as if Keel kept a loose-leaf journal about paranormal events, both reported to and experienced by him, over the course of many years, then decided to throw all of the individual pages in the air, let them land as they might, stuck a couple hundred of them in a notebook and sent them off to his publisher. There is no novel-like narrative in The Mothman Prophecies, and it's not in chronological order-instead it choppily bounces back and forth and for its entire length.The funny thing is that it works for the most part. I'm hesitant to say that the atemporally schizophrenic nature of the journal entries was an intentional, clever move on Keel's part, but it just may have been. The net effect is to mirror the inexplicability, seeming pointlessness, and skewered nature of the phenomena that Keel is talking about, but unfortunately, sometimes the attention-deficit-disorder-ladenness of the book is just aggravating. The primary thing to remember, if the book sounds interesting enough to you to tackle it (not that it's longer than your average pulp novel), is not to expect anything like a normal plot. There's an endless parade of names and events, many of which are only mentioned in one section, and it takes awhile to stop thinking that you're going to have to remember them to understand the story later. There really is no story. But once you stop waiting for a story to begin, The Mothman Prophecies should be more enjoyable to you.There are plenty of reasons you might be interested in this book. Of course, there's the surface topic-a series of paranormal events ranging from UFO's to flying \\"birdmen\\" (the Mothman) to misbehaving telephones. If you're at all a student of the paranormal, you'll want to read this. Or, you probably already have. For me, I was initially intrigued by the film and the claim that it was based on true events (although publisher Tor calls it fiction on the copyright/catalog data page). But once I started reading, I quickly forgot about the film and instead was fascinated with the realization that The Mothman Prophecies must have been one of Chris Carter's primary sources for various plots of The X-Files.If you're an X-Files fan, The Mothman Prophecies will tie the show together for you in an unprecedented way. After you read this book, the \\"mytharc\\" shows (all the alien conspiracy stuff) will no longer seem disconnected from the monster shows. And you'll frequently find yourself reminded of specific episodes correlated to specific journal entries in the book.Undoubtedly, you'll find yourself wondering at some point how much of The Mothman Prophecies is fact and how much is fiction. Tor calling the book \\"fiction\\" doesn't help towards taking it too seriously, and neither does Keel's frequent references to UFO-monger Gray Barker, who was exposed as making up at least some of the things he wrote about--see, for instance, John C. Sherwood's May/June 1998 article in Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Joe Nickell has also prepared a \\"debunking\\" of the Mothman for Skeptical Inquirer's March/April 2002 issue. I'm nothing if not a skeptic, but Nickell doesn't actually debunk much. He suggests that Mothman sightings were actually sightings of owls, and that's about all there is to his article. Keel's book, and the film that prompted Nickell's article, is about much more than can be explained by sighting an owl and mistaking it for something else.From my standpoint as a philosopher, there's something even more interesting about Keel's book. It's a wonderful example of instrumentalism. Instrumentalism, briefly, is the idea that theories about phenomena, insofar as they depart from simply recounting the phenomena in a dry manner, are interchangeable. That is, there are a multitude of possible theories for the metaphysics \\"behind\\" any observed event, and even allowing Occam's Razor (which is just a convention, not a fact, so we need not allow it-it could be misleading), any of them that accounts for the observed event is just as good as any other.Of course Keel sometimes leads us on by simple juxtaposition of easily explainable events-even going so far as implying that there could have been something paranormal about the missing minutes on the Watergate tapes-and he could be making up a sizable percentage of the anecdotes to entertain us, but that's ultimately why you should read this book anyway-for entertainment. It's also, even if fiction, a fascinating psychological artifact, and even as fiction with plenty of structural quirks, an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I just had to clarify the fact that the movie is &quot;based&quot; on the events that are recorded in Keel's book. The book is by far and away better than the movie. First off the book takes place in 1967/68 not the present. Besides giving you a look into all the paranormal phenomenon floating around Point Pleasant at the time it also gives you a look into the attitude and fear the people of the small town were feeling at the time.There are stories of aliens, strange lights, men in black, mysterious phone calls and of course the mothman. The name is misleading as he does not resemble a moth at all (in fact the name came from a reporter making a reference to a Batman villian). But to anyone interested in cryptozoology he is a beast that is worth looking into.True the book is a little egotistical as John Keel makes himself out to be a superhero at times but I genuinely enjoy his take on the situations. His writing style is a little choppy and sometimes jumps into other accounts of unexplained events but it is easy to get through.As this is really the only book that centers on the Mothman and the events in Point Pleasant it is definately reccommended reading for paranormal fans. There is even a section on Indrid Cold (another being worth looking into for the interesting and sometimes ridiculous story).Just please don't slight this chilling tale because of the terrible movie apparently made from the book's cliff notes."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"There are studied subjects and phenomenon out there that defy scientific explanation. Just because one cannot put a particular phenomenon under the rigours of scientific examination, doesn't mean such phenomenon is merely the product of a deranged mind. The reason the protectors of divine rationality are reluctant to examine the paranormal is it seems to contradict known physical laws. It doesn't follow the rules. However, if you have actually had the fortune or misfortune to experience such phenomenon i.e., spirits, UFO's, demonic creatures or source less cries of anguish in the night, ~The Mothman Prophecies~ can seem almost plausible. The book is certainly entertaining and, surprisingly, at times quite frightening.The book essentially focuses on a series of unexplained events that manifested in and around the little West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Numerous reports of Unidentified Flying Objects and strange lights in the southern skies motivated John Keel to investigate what all the fuss was about, and if there was any truth to the reports. His investigations led him down a peculiar path of events and personal experiences that finally pushed him to develop a theory, albeit an extrardinary one.What is the 'Mothman'? A journalist coined the term from the popular Batman series, because the actual creature, taken from eyewitness accounts, resembles the legendary comic hero. The amount of actual sightings is nothing less than incredible, which leads one to suspect the beast's reality. The book only touches on the Mothman and relates a scattered assortment of weird events and unusual sightings from the 'Men in Black' to 'abductions' and the cries of infants in the night. Throughout the book, Keel attempts to connect the dots, so to speak, inferring that all the varied phenomenon could well come from a single source. This is a big reach, but so is the book as a whole.Keel proposes that these manifestations, UFO's, MIB, winged-beasts et al, possibly originate from an alternate reality - another dimension if you will. These other dimensional being(s) guide and play with the human race and have been for a very long time. Throughout history these beings have manifested in many guises and forms, according to a specific historical/social context, depending on civilizations particular belief system at the time. For example, in the middle ages, this other dimensional phenomenon showed in the form of witches, warlocks, fairies and elves. For the American Indian, the phenomenon appeared as nature spirits; and in ancient times, they manifested as winged-lions, centaurs and Olympic gods. Because of our technological advancements and predilection to anything 'scientific', they now show as flying saucers, aliens and FBI agents. In other words, Keel suggests that their form shows in the way we 'interpret' these sightings - screened through our socially conditioned minds.Generally these amazing stories are told in a matter of fact tone, a journalistic style, setting the reader up from the start to lend credence to the entire book. This is clever and it works. But one gets the impression that Keel is absolutely serious about his subject matter - and to this day is trying to get to the bottom of it. This is what makes the book intriguing and worth the time."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I have read over 200 books on UFOs and for many reasons, this is my favorite. Keel is an honest investigator who was fortunate to be involved in the strange, spooky events he writes about. Taken along with his first book, Operation Trojan Horse, this slim volume says more about the true nature of the UFO phenomenon than almost any other book written since. I was initially doubtful of the validity of Keel's claims, as some other reviewers are. However, I had the luck of meeting a man mentioned in the book who accompanied Keel on his investigations. This person, whom I trust and sincerely believe to be honest, flatly stated that everything in the book was true, that he had been there, spoke to the witnesses, and eventually became involved in the phenomena, as did Keel. The fact is, these things happened. In fact, Keel left some of the strangest evidence out of the book. Mothman Prophecies is a fascinating true story, and I recommend it to anyone who has a real desire to know the truth about UFOs and the paranormal."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"If you want to read one book about how creepy the truly weird can become, start with this one. This book is probably the most frightening, bizarre book ever written in this field, by a reporter who was actually there when the events happened.Some of the reviewers that gave this book one star probably missed the point. The reason that Mothman, the men in black, and UFO reports are all in the book is that these are all different pieces of the same puzzle; they didn't all show up there together by coincidence. The book seems to jump around from topic to topic because all of these things were happening at the same time, and they are interrelated. Some readers probably don't see that (or don't want to), probably the same ones who saw the movie first and then decided to pick up the book, not realizing that &quot;the rest of the story&quot; is much stranger than the movie ever hinted at.The movie, which only focused on psychic effects of the Mothman sightings, left out many important aspects of the mystery (mostly so they could add a fictional love story for Richard Gere.) A friend who hadn't read the book called the movie &quot;incomplete&quot;, which is the best description I could give it too. But the book weaves all the bizarre elements together gradually as the events unfold, and they all need to be taken together to find some understanding of these phenomena. (Read Keel's classic &quot;Operation Trojan Horse&quot; for even more on solving these deep mysteries.)Sure, this book isn't &quot;All About Mothman&quot;, but that's a weak criticism. The movie wasn't about Mothman at all! At least the book has enough scary moments for a decade of Stephen King TV miniseries. That's more than enough reason to give it 5 stars, whether or not you believe in these types of phenomena. Read it before bedtime at your own risk."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I never read 5 star reviews because they usually just gush about how wonderful the book is and don't provide a balanced view. Yet here I am doing just that. But this book is perhaps the only of the many I have read on UFOs, the &quot;paranormal&quot; or the occult that truly deserves it. First and foremost, Keel is a great storyteller. He transcends the dry facts of the phenomena he investigates and weaves them into compelling human stories while, at the same time, challenges the readers to examine their own assumptions and biases about paranormal phenomena. I began reading about flying saucers and related phenomena because I thought they were silly and they appealed to the same part of me that appreciates Alfred Jarry or Marcel Duchamp. But by reading Mothman, I discovered that there are real human stories, real lives changed forever by these events that I found so silly. That reality is so much stranger and wonderous than I was willing to accept."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The fact is, these things &quot;happened&quot; - in the sense that they were reported about - and the Mothman phenomena is fairly well-documented in other places. However, this is one of the only actual published books I have managed to locate on the topic, so it deserves scrutiny. Its very apparent that something very strange was going on in West Virginia in the months leading up to the Point Pleasant bridge disaster. Taken as a more or less matter-of-fact document of the times, it works pretty well. Its almost funny how Keel describes his participation in these events, like sitting up and watching strange lights in the sky every Wednesday evening is no big deal. Keel maintains a general tone of paranoia and eerieness throughout the book, due to his rambling, but more or less matter-of-fact tone. Credibility is questionable because lot of the reconstructed conversations sound a little too contrived and detailed to be anything more than fiction or imagination (I should mention Carlos Castaneda's name at this point).Keel seems to be putting forward a very Terence McKenna-like philosophy of the goings-on, that there are invisible inter-dimensional psychic entities that are capable of influencing the world about them (except of course the part about needing heroic doses of psylocibin to see them) and they were somehow involved with what happened around Point Pleasant. But to what end? Keel seems to have opinions but he more or less keeps them to himself, or allowed his publisher to purge them. The book has been too chopped up and filtered to be anything more than kitsch. Its still a fascinating read and recommended for fans of the paranormal."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES can stand simply as a &quot;stranger than science&quot; potboiler, but it's much more than that. Keel is recognized as one of the few &quot;serious&quot; researchers into the paranormal, and the power of his insights into this vexing subject shows in the fact that his ideas are quoted and seconded by no less a UFO authority than Dr. Jacques Vallee. The &quot;high strangeness&quot; nature of what is described in the book morphs easily into what is generally perceived as &quot;pure kookiness&quot; -- but the strength of the book lies in the way that line between belief and disbelief and truth and fiction is pushed further and further, with a good deal of shivers and goosebumps building up along the way. Bottom line: The book's utterly unique, and worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I was both amused and entertained! Yet there is an air of realism to this book that really gets to you. When you are finished reading this book, even being the grandest sceptic... The only thing that left me slightly short was the fact we are not informed of where these paranormals originate. But that is not important as the story is super written and not a weak spot in it. I say absolutely yes, get it.If you enjoyed this another book which states all these events(including the Roswell crash) are actually from our future in a very good book, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"An interesting and fascinating report on paranormal events that took place in small town West Virginia in 1966/67. The author records the events as he experiences them or they are reported to him by others. The reports are many. These are mostly regarding a huge winged figure that many people witnessed and who supposedly terrorized the residents of the area for an entire year. The most fascinating and unnerving part of the book is it's reports of all the &quot;men in black&quot; contacts and ufo incidents. It has been many years since these events and therefore this book was probably quite scary when it was first published, but has lost some of the impact in our desensitized society. The book falters though when the author suggests that ufo experiences in general are a mass hallucination of somekind, which at this point in time is more ridiculous than just admitting their existence. The writing style is rather lacking, but not so noticed due to the content. The book might turn off someone who realizes that the author's ego is of more focus than the information he is reporting."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop.

Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled \\"John Keel explains how the universe really works\\". For every \\"Mothman\\" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's \\"research\\" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the \\"Mothman\\" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences.

I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I found this book very interesting. I felt it covered the actual happenings in a factual manner without making it boring.The author also did not seem to discount the fact that there could be more here than meets the eye.

At times the reader would like to read more about a particular case history--more detail--more follow-up. The lack of this information may lead the reader to feel shortchanged. On the other hand the excessive number of people having encounters lends to the credibility of the book, especially so with the witnesses in Point Pleasant, West Virginia where the mothman is first seen on November 15, 1967. The book's climatic end is expected with the diaster on December 15, 1968.John Keel's &quot;Mothman&quot; is undoubtably a classic, not only for ufologists but for mainstream readers as well, more particularly now that the release of the &quot;Mothman movie is imminent.P L Brown"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I thought this book was very informative to the reader. It's the first book that I have read about 'mothman' or ufos and now I am more interested in the phenomena. The content of this book is good, but I think that it could have been organized a little better. It would have helped if the author told the story in chronological order. There is not much dialog, but if you enjoy reading a book filled with desccription, then this book would probably appeal to you. Do not expect the book to be just like the movie because it's not, it goes more into detail.

You will learn next to nothing about what was going on in Point Pleasant, and why the bridge collapsed.This book is largely an unorganized, haphazard semi-autobiograhpical collection of anecdotes that appear to be meaningful to the author, most of them about flying saucers and men in black and the author's problems with his phone bill. The &quot;narrative&quot; skips around in time and place and subject. Keel devotes more pages to some odd people in the Long Island ufo community than he does to writing about the bridge. He has two sentences about why the bridge might have collapsed. There are no photos, maps, figures, or appendices in this book. Unless you get a map of the Point Plesant area, you have no idea where the events he describes takes place. There are about 10 footnotes, and they document trivial, dumb stuff.Keel must be laughing about selling the title of this book to the movie company. Even though the movie wasn't all that good, it was far better than this book.It's not so much I regret spending the money on this book, but I feel very foolish about having wasted two hours reading it."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel's \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" follows a usual form for ufology books: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious \\"sightings\\". This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\"Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest.

It scared me more than I'd bargained for. It isn't the UFO mystery- the saucers were cinematically graceful and playful and so abundant that it was like watching migrating birds. No,it was what happened down on the old \\"nitrogen, oxygen and cosmic spit\\"- formed earth that freaked me out. I read alone and late at night.The strange men- later called men in black and MIB, visited people living in remote areas- WV in the 60's- young pregnant women, an elderly man who ran home for his shotgun and a divorced woman on a farm where the cattle were drained of their blood. One of her son's told the author, yeah, his mom was really upset when she saw those lights outside. Frankly, had they come to me- I'd be outta there so fast and Never go back. Get a gun? I don't think so. These people- and I guess that's how a book gets written- would go out on midnight walks down deserted roads- oh no! And when you knew these 'things' were out and about? Writing this, it seems more contrived than it did during the reading- I mean even if West Virginia was a low stat crime state- who would walk down dark, deserted roads, when there was no moon and you know Mothman had been cited flying up and staring with his large illuminated red eyes. Sometimes, those eyes would lazer people into paralysis and later vomiting and other illnesses. The UFO's could turn a light on you, or even one of their visitors could somehow leave you with a checkerboard burn that left and returned again with no medical rationale. Kids love those Scary Stories collections and they are often old mountain folk tales, perhaps this was just a modern sort of scariness en masse. (And later, for profit.) Anyway, it got to me. I think when deciding to believe or not, it is often the author's voice, that makes the difference. And I found Keel to be a semi-self effacing and overall 'normal' narrator which did keep me reading when otherwise I'd have quit. If you are the sort that either has an interest in the paranormal, or you just enjoy a good dose of fear and foreboding- not me, for sure- then I'd say read the book. I was interested in the previous reviewers' personal revelations and think they are important antidotes, especially from someone who hyped the stuff at one time. Prophecies' author, Keel, discusses how those that he interviewed were not on the surface seemingly capable of carrying out such a well-entwined ruse- and that was also my reaction. But when reading how easily a smart, creative fraud can really incite some interest and corroboration; that also is needed to balance the oftentimes extremely schizoid fervor and longing for more chaos in our existence. I remain doubtful- and if not that, hopeful that they don't come anywhere near me cause I am not the one!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"As an investigative record of bizarre experiences, some first hand, The Mothman Prophesies is as timely and interesting a read now as it was when it was first published almost thirty years ago. I disagree with some of Keel's conclusions, at least with respect to them being the final word in what is obviously an ongoing puzzle, but he points to some very interesting possibilities. His notions are well worth adding to the soup of the still bubbling mystery that such bizarre experiences as Mothman, MIBs, strange aerial lights, odd electrical and poltergeist effects, etc., represent.That much if not all of what is reported is Earth-related does not lessen the difficulty of asserting categorically that &quot;extradimensional&quot; beings are entirely localized. The possibility of worlds without end lie that way, whether connected by wormholes or whatever in this dimension or in other layers outside of this one. I'd bet John a bottle of HERRADURA SELECCION SUPREMA tequila that our multilayered universe is full of life in many forms, mostly unexpected, and that this will become obvious far sooner than later (in the next hundred years at least).-- Randy"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Frightening and endlessly facinating.

In the book, the couple who answered the door for John Keel (John Klein in the movie) died in the Silver Bridge Tragedy.There are many interesting facts in The Mothman Prophecies.I think that this is a good book for Ufology fans.I very strongly disagree with anyone who gives this book a low rating.If you want to learn about MIB's,UFO's,Mothman,strange creatures, and Tulpas (mind projections), this is a good book to teach you all about these areas."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Having read most of John Keels's other UFO-paranormal books I was still not prepared for the knock-out dramatic conclusion to this one. I've read some other reviews in here and they seem to be all over the place. What you need to know about John Keel is that he investigated and traveled around the world to the sites of as many UFO and paranormal events as he could to see where the event took place and meet the people involved. This is in contrast to some of the so called 'investigations' made by the Air Force's Project Blue Book and armchair UFO investigators who often relied solely on second hand information. This quest was combined with a keen insight into the underlying nature of UFO and paranormal phenomena. For that reason I trust his opinions and speculations more than any other researcher out here. Keel also used news clipping services as all UFO writers do, to locate sightings and correlate information from everywhere to help piece the whole paranormal puzzle together. Information is a good thing. Information that is checked out is even better. Keel also did not try to exclude certain information that seemed too bizarre or that might not support the 'extraterrestrial' hypothesis that the old school of UFO research is obsessed with. This is one of the very best books ever written on the UFO and Paranormal subject and is considered a classic. I highly recommend both this and all of John Keel's UFO books."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"John Keel is the prototype for the serious investigator of the paranormal. He combines just the right combination of skepticism and open- mindedness, along with a genuine sense of the absurdity yet reality of the situation he's dealing with. This book deals with one of the most famous series of incidents in the annals of Forteana or the paranormal, the &quot;Mothman&quot; incident or incidents which took place in a rural area of West Virginia in late 1966. Keel describes the seemingly unbelievable sequence of events with wry detachment. At the same time he conveys a sense of dread and fear in the face of incidents for which there is no rational explanation. Keel is probably the closest we have to the most famous and probably best chronicler of the strange and bizarre, Charles Fort. More than anything else, this book reminds us of what Shakespeare said, &quot;There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The great thing about this book is it works as a nonfiction book, if you're a believer and as a book of fiction, if you're a nonbeliever.If you believe in UFO's and monsters, the interviews with the people sound very sincere and convincing.If you don't believe in the subject, the book reads like a good horror novel with a tragic ending which is based on a true event"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Ok, we have seen the movie, some of us have read Keel's book (this being a reprint). What no one seems to mention is the fine print located on the copyright page, which reads: \\"This is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously.\\" If you don't believe me, glance at the copyright page. Obviously, this paperback edition was prepared as a movie tie-in. Touted as a \\"true event\\" the publisher then informs us it is all a work of the \\"author's imagination.\\" And therein must lie a lot of truth. Yes, the book is mildly entertaining, if a bit choppy in parts. My advice is, read THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES with a large dose of salt (and the movie is much better)."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is very informative and worth a read if you're interested in this legend and the multiple events that took place. However, I must say the book is unorganized as it seems to jump from story to story and repeat itself in some details and events. All in all I thouroughly enjoyed this book though."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The Mothman Prophecies is one of the few books that I've felt compelled to read several times. It's scary, thrilling, and intensely interesting, at least to a \\"paranomal\\" buff such as myself. And all of this in a nonfiction book. Perhaps truth really is stranger than fiction!It seems some people don't like John Keel's writing style, as it seems rather scatterbrained. I believe this is deliberate, as the different subcategories of subject matter, such as the men in black, UFOs, the Mothman itself, etc., are touched on briefly, repeatedly intertwined with other subcategories of phenomena that were encountered during Keel's Point Pleasant adventure. This sylistic decision necessitated a temporally scattered book, in the interest of spreading out the aforementioned, varying subject matter.The less informed typically negatively assess the eyewitness reports given in this book. Yes, it is odd that these alleged extra-dimensional beings possess a mixture sophisticated technology, and patently unsophisticated, contemporary human technology of the time. It isn't right to lambaste Keel or his interviewees over this subject matter of their testimony. The mixture of the low and high tech has been seen in most UFO contact cases of the last 130 years. Ultimately, this supports the theory, unpopular with many of the tinfoil hat wearers who give UFOlogists a bad name, that the UFO phenomena have probably absolutely nothing to do with aliens.There are many strange features of the varied stories in this book. If you keep an open mind, you may find them just as entertaining as I do!"},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Books about the paranormal I never find to be entirely satisfying; you get teased and left to make up your own mind. I get drawn to this kind of material for some reason, always hoping to get some answers, to figure it out, to fit this into my theistic worldview. A year ago I got my first taste of satisfaction, from the book \\"Lights in the sky and little green men\\", in which the authors concluded that residual UFO's, the ones that cannot be explained away, are in fact real, but are not physical but spiritual.John Keel, with The Mothman Prophecies, arrives at a somewhat similar conclusion. He scoffs at the idea that these are visitors from other planets, but is less convinced that they are from the spiritual realm, at least as commonly understood by Christians. His bizarre thirteen month set of experiences centered on Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966-1967, culminating in the tragedy of the bridge collapse, has left him certain of nothing. He does seem to see a continuity between paranormal experiences throughout history and those of today, with poltergeists, demons, Bigfoot, Nessie, UFOs, and Men in Black all falling under the same explanatory umbrella, whatever that may be. Possibly an independent spiritual world exists, or possibly these are psychic imprints and pollution, echoes that play back in certain geographical locations, like a record stuck, playing back the same groove over and over.You are not going to get closure from this book, but his account is gripping and his speculations are thoughtful and intelligent. To repeat an overused phrase, you are not going to want to put it down."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"When I was a kid, I collected all sorts of books on the supernatural and unexplained. UFOs, Bigfoot, ghosts, the Loch Ness Monster. There was no mystery that didn't interest me. One of the books I found was called THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.Growing up in Southern Ohio on the Ohio River, I didn't take much interest in this book. Probably because it read like a jumbled mess of monsters, UFO sightings, Men in Black, etc., and that the idea of a moth-man monster flying through the skies just down the river from where I lived sounded preposterous (even to a wishful, wide-eyed kid).I didn't read the book until after they'd made the recent film with Richard Gere and Laura Linney. The movie manages to pull the creepiest moments but it didn't quite work either. (My major complaint remains that you can't have a monster movie and never give us a good look at the monster).But I read the book and found it alternately interesting and amusing. Keel does a good job of taking the most outlandish elements of his \\"investigation\\" and blending them into a logical procession of ideas (if not always a logical story).It's fun if you don't take it too seriously. I still enjoy the creepy thrill of mystery at the edges of our shrinking world...no matter how far-fetched and outlandish they sound. The Mothman of West Virginia certainly falls into that category.The creature has taken on a life of its own. There's a 12-foot statue of the Mothman (it looks more like reptile-like Sleestak from \\"Land of the Lost\\" than a real Mothman) standing in Point Pleasant, West Virginia and a museum I hope to visit someday. Documentaries play on the Travel Channel and on youtube.com about the legend. I just saw there's a festival for the Mothman in Point Pleasant this month (Sept) so I'll have to check that out sometime if I'm back that way during that time.For more info, check out the 5-part \\"The Search for the Mothman\\" on youtube and definitely the 3-part \\"The Mothman Debunked\\" also on youtube.com."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"Upon my initial reading of this book one thought came to my mind: &quot;confusing&quot;. There wasn't anything even remotely like a &quot;stroy&quot; going on, but rather a mishmash of facts, and experiences from a number of individuals related to the phenomenon known as the mothman, the MIB, and UFO encounters.After having saw the film, I then took another chance to read it, and found it to be fascinating in the way that I believe that Keel had intended for it to be confusing (this is due to a scene in the film where one of the characters utters &quot;We aren't supposed to know what they mean...&quot;), and I give him the utmost respect for it. He has created a book that is both unsettling, and highly enjoyable (it reminds me of the feeling I got when I first read Burrough's &quot;dope&quot; manifesto &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;)This is one of those books where all things aren't supposed to make sense, and where you are supposed to get your own interpretation from the &quot;prophecies&quot; contained within. Whether a work of fiction, or non-fiction, &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; is a fascinating read, and a good primer to the world of UFOs, MIB, and cryptozoology. I definitely recommend this to any fan of the paranormal."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"This book is fascinating reading. It 'rings true to me'. Mr. Keel tells the reader when he's scared, looking for more information or not sure what he's seeing. I think he's very up front and honest.There is much I think that can be learned by Mr. Keel's experiences and interviews. Men In Black, Ufo's, and strange sounds are all in this book. Monsters and mysteries that prove we don't know everything on this Earth and in this universe yet.My one big complaint and why it's rated a four rather than a five is that many times Mr. Keel gets off track in his writing. This leaves the reader a bit confused and forced to back track at times. Further, I find many times I would have been going back to find more information and it doesn't seem he does that, at least not in the book. This is frustrating for me. I'd like more information, more about the interviews he conducted etc.Not a bad book over all. Just a few not so positive thoughts on it. I enjoyed it and read it in about two days.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"I have never been interested in UFO literature, but decided to give this book a try. The early portions of the book are rather dry documentations of UFO sightings and other paranormal incidents. Towards the end of the book however, things pick up considerably. The author's description of events is credible and eerie. He concludes that so-called 'extraterrestrial' beings are really with us here on Earth but only perceived by those with perceptual abilities that most of us do not have. He also concludes that such beings are capable of influencing and interfering with humans. For books outside of the UFO literature that corroborate Mr. Keel's conclusions I recommend 1) The Active Side of Infinity (Carlos Castaneda), 2) Far Journeys (Robert Monroe), 3)The Path (Esmeralda Arana)."},{"Title":"Mothman Prophecies","review":"The classic on stange phenomena and the paranormal written by the man who was there.

From the poisonous mines of Almaden to the poisonous laboratories of the West Side, it has been ethnically based labor for low pay that has allowed the county to develop in all its prolific economic richness. The author's book provides an overview of these dynamics through research, figures, facts, and eyewitness accounts.The \\"devil\\" mentioned in the title has to do with racism, and the book goes beyond the usual sociological and psychological explanations of racism to emphasize its classist underpinnings in a supposedly classless society.

London: Zed Books, 1997. 224 pp.Nickenia JoseciteUniversity of FloridaIn Writing African Women, Stephanie Newell offers insight from various African writers from the areas of Senegal and Nigeria in regards to the controversy over gender discrimination in West Africa. Each author goes into their take of portraying the life conditions of African women versus how society depicts women in Africa to be. Their in-depth reasoning and explanation for the ways things are in their culture helps deteriorate the ethnocentric view of others in the world. To other cultures, many African women are seen as being stuck in time and not evolving and speaking up for their rights.In part one of the book Akosua Gyamfuaa-Fofie states, \\"Instead of following this precedent for West African women's organizations to stand up and fight for their rights, however, women in Ghana have continued to live shrouded in silence\\" (p. 41). Traditionally males have been known to dominate the world. Women have been generally known to be submissive to the authority of man, which in turn does not allow women to be a part of decision-making and to just accept the laws and rules that are set for them as is. Tradition is very important to many West Africans and is the reason why it is adhered to.According to part two of the book Ibiyemi Mojola makes an astonishing statement, \\"The \\"burden\\" of African womanhood in these texts comes from within and without, for women have internalized a socially constructed sense of self that causes them to accept, consciously or unconsciously, the role of second fiddle; Montagu writes that, \\"women have been so long conditioned in the environment of masculine dominance that they have come to expect the male to be dominant and the female to be subservient (Montagu 1974: 26)\\" (p. 127). Being that their culture is deeply embedded in them, women find it very distraught to stray away and find their own voice. Women are seen as a commodity or possession that is utilized to benefit men. Some African women are grouped as a disadvantaged minority within their society. Gyamfuaa-Fofie states that according to the custom \\"Women bear the burden of being wives, mothers and house-keepers, most often working to earn a living at the same time. In short, she is the workhorse of the family\\" (p. 131). With a lack of questioning, women have historically followed their cultural ways and traditions. Many married women are illiterate because they society fears that if females gain a valuable foundation in education, then it will result in their economic independence and self-confidence. By any means necessary, this is avoided to maintain male dominance.Newell explains in part three of the book that, \\"Repeatedly, authors emphasize that households have been destabilized and families broken up as a result of women's economic independence and insistence on choosing their own marriage partners (Fakunle 1992: 78-83)\\" (p. 170). \\"Urban women are presumed to have deviated from established and accepted domestic patterns\\" (p. 170-171). Because of this some West African societies view this as something that they consider to have worked for so long, so they do not see the reason to change it. The establishments of traditions are created as normal behavior that should take place within the society. These are the cultural values that are respected and anything else that differs is frowned upon and rejected. This explains why there are few female writers in Africa. Breaking the silence of African female writers is not progressing as much as other societies feel it should because of the strong ties to tradition that West African societies are accustomed to."},{"Title":"Okhrana: The Paris Operations of the Russian Imperial Police","review":"The Author/Compiler's Note states \\"This is a first in a planned series of thematic collections of articles that appeared previously in classified editions of the Intelligence Community journal Studies in Intelligence, which is published at CIA.

Within the universe of the novel, however, no one affirms: it is the realm of play and of hypotheses. In the novel, then, reflection is essentially inquiring, hypothetical.&quot;Thus Milan Kundera affirms the wonder and beauty of the novel and explains the difference between how philosophers think and how novelists think. Born of the Modern Era ushered in by seventeenth century rationalism, the novel contemplates and explores existence in the Modern Era. Like the Modern Era, the novel is distinguished by its ambiguity and complexity. For Kundera, the novel's core is an inquiry, not a moral position. It makes sense, therefore, that in a world where humans long for black/white, wrong/right distinction, that the \\"wisdom of uncertainty\\" which Kundera calls the wisdom of the novel, should be so hard to accept and understand.This remarkable short book shares the seven part form of several of Kundera's novels: each can stand alone but all are connected by vital and pervading themes. The seven parts comprise two essays, a collection of notes, two dialogues, a dictionary of sixty-three words, and an acceptance speech for a literary prize--and not in the order just mentioned. This mosaic structure works well to underscore part of Kundera's point: there are many ways to approach an understanding of the novel. Is Don Quixote a critique or a celebration of idealism? Both cases have been made often, neither is right--the novel's spirit of complexity and continuity brooks no dogmatism. In fact, the novel has its own \\"radical autonomy\\" which Kundera uses to illuminate the works of Franz Kafka. It can say and show things humans cannot achieve in any other way.If the novel that is art--the novel that truly says something new--is to survive, novelists would do well to think more like Milan Kundera. Readers of THE ART OF THE NOVEL, meanwhile, will gain a new appreciation for the genre as well as valuable insight into the thought process of one of the world's greatest living novelists."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"Milan Kundera is a Czechoslavakian writer who lives in France. He's written a number of novels, among the THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING. In this, his first nonfiction effort, Kundera relates the concept of the novel to his own work. The first two essays were inspired by an interview he gave to The Paris Review on his practical experiences with the art of the novel.His focus goes beyond his own work, however. Kundera presents some rather intense and unusual analyses of his personal favorite writers: Cervantes, Rabelais, Sterne, Diderot, Flaubert, Tolstoy and Kafka, to name just a few.This is a book for the scholarly reader; the reader who knows literature. It is one that illuminates all sorts of possibilities for writing the novel, for Kundera points out the the novel can express life in ways that can't be achieved by any other form.He moves from the general to the specific -- from the form of the novel, to the way others have used it, to his own work. Particularly interesting is his dictionary of 63 key words which he says are essential to understanding his fiction. His observations about the state of contemporary Russian literature -- what is being published and why -- are fascinating. He also expresses his frustration, as an author, with translators of his works and how they handle language.&quot;The art of reading,&quot; wrote Andre Maurois, &quot;is in great part that of acquiring a better understanding of life from one's encounter with a book.&quot; Readers will come away from this with a better understand of the novel as an expression of life as well as deeper insight into a number of classical works."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This relatively small book (165 pages) offers an engaging peek into the mind of a brilliant novelist and scholar. Consisting of interviews, speeches, and published work, Kundera expounds on his literary beliefs about what makes a great novel. My favorite sections are the interviews because of their immediacy and accessibility, although the author's most profound insights arise from his discussion of other authors: Kafka, Cervantes, Tolstoy, Flaubert, and others.Writers, students of literature, and Kundera's faithful readers should find much to think about in these pages. This is not a light discourse on how to write a novel; Kundera takes his art seriously, in both deeply instinctive and scholarly ways. Those looking for a how-to book would be well-served to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I recall that when asked about his &quot;Theorie Aesthetique&quot; by a journalist, Picasso took out a pistol and shot it in the air. Evidently Picasso did not care to banalize his works into neat theories for art critics. The problem is that Picasso often did lapse into following a theoretical form...more so in his later works.I read this book in French, &quot;L'Art Du Roman&quot; and while it does not attempt to reduce Kundera's works to neat theories, it does shed light on the philosphical underpinnings of many of his novels.In fact, one of the main themes of this book is the critique of reductionism. He exalts the &quot;Wisdom of Uncertainty&quot; and eschews any art work that proceeds from an ideology or moral high ground as such leads to judgement rather than understanding. Somewhat in an existentialist vein, Kundera promotes the idea of &quot;l'ambiguite&quot; as the ideal for the novel. That is to say that given we live in a world where there is no right or wrong way to proceed, the role of the novel is to understand each character within his own constructs, not according to some extrnal morality or ideology.Kundera's debt to Heidegger is made obvious throughout the book, and Kundera quotes him often. One is left wondering what Kundera's ideas on morality might be. However, I would not go so far as saying that he follows suit with Heidegger on this mattter. Heidegger's &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; is interested in the question of being. For Da-Sein, morality is secondary, and relativistic, not primary and essential. No doubt, this indiffference towards morality led to Heidegger's nazism. However, if Kundera does not take a moralistic posture in &quot;unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, he defintiely implies that we suffer or thrive on a spiritual level with certain choices that we make....-Thomas Seay"},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I am starting a novel this summer, and this book was recommended to me by my Creative Writing professor. Being a fan of Kundera already, I bought the book without question.For the reviewer who said that Kundera writes pretentiously: I am actually amazed, since Kundera's lack of pretention and clarity surprised me. So much literary criticism is bloated and difficult to read, but Kundera is very simple, very concise, and yet also explanatory. Often he will make a statement, such as \\"All novels are concerned with the enigma of the self,\\" which he not only explains but gives immediate examples, never letting the flash of his writing try to convey the point.So much ground is covered in this tiny book: the difference between modernism and \\"establishment modernism,\\" the craft of his own work, the history and purpose of the novel, insights into several of his great works, insights into European history, parallels between music and literature, etc, etc. Make sure to take notes, since your memory won't be able to hold everything in.I praise Kundera also for his deep respect for the novel, not only arguing against those \\"established modernists\\" who claim the novel is dead or antiquated, but stressing the infinite possibilities of the novel and how the weaknesses of the great works show the paths future novels can take. Rather than being pretentious or snobbish, Kundera reaffirms the life of the novel as central to the question of the self, which is as infinite as the novel is.This book is also essential for writers especially. For plotting out the structure for my work, Kundera's insights have been invaluable. Of course, Kundera doesn't suggest you write as he does, and you won't want to, but his radiant insight surely helped me find out what I myself wanted to do. Kundera's essays prompt exploration and possibility. A great read."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I haven't read a book this brilliant and intellectually-provoking in a long time. Milan Kundera is a first-class thinker who will be and has been pegged as elitist and pretentious by some reviewers here (and elsewhere I'm sure). Since we're living in an age of ever-diminishing education where a college diploma is equivalent to what a technical degree used to be, this is to be expected, and is indeed flattery. In the section of the book called Sixty-three Words, Kundera himself addresses the issue under \\"Elitism\\": The word \\"elitism\\" only appeared in France in 1967 [note: it appeared elsewhere in Europe as much as ten years earlier]. For the first time in history, the very language threw a glare of negativity, even mistrust, on the notion of elite. Official propaganda in the Communist countries began to pummel elitism and elitists at the same time. It used the terms to designate not captains of industry or famous athletes or politicians but only the cultural elite: philosophers, writers, professors, historians, figures in film and theater....It seems that in the whole of Europe the cultural elite is yielding to other elites. Over there, to the elite of the police apparatus. Here, to the elite of the mass media apparatus. No one will ever accuse these new elites of elitism...In this dense but slim work, Kundera discusses the essence of the novel, which is in his view the exploration of uncharted territory through structure, insight, ideas and themes. Which is the idea of art in general, really, be it painting, music or anything else. In a revealing section, he talks about the tyranny of kitsch, which is the beautification (and in the process simplification) of everything, to make it palatable to the reader/viewer. Kitsch is prettified lies, in other words, and he points out how most of us live all of our lives this way, never looking below the surface, never grasping the complete and true meaning of most anything. With the mechanism of unfettered, unquestioned capitalism the reigning societal model in the 20th (and even more so now in the 21st) century, this uniformity is fast becoming the only acceptable model, in his (and my) view. Thus the very impetus that drives the novel--and all art--is, in his view (and my view) dying, if not dead.Those stuck in the tyranny of kitsch may object: there are plenty of novels out there--Anne Rice and JK Rowlings and Ken Follett and Tom Clancey. Those are the purveyers of kitsch Kundera was talking about. To wit, jazz, another art form, is dead. Sure we have Wynton Marsalis et al, but they haven't advanced the art one iota. Lennie Tristano did and the world is still almost completely unfamiliar with his work, because jazz listeners aren't ready for real advances in the art; they'd prefer prepackaged familiarity being offered as advances. *That* Kundera would define as kitsch. Occasionally a true iconoclast breaks through the mold--Thelonious Monk--but they are usually celebrated long after they make their mark or for superficialities and eccentricities. Of course there *are* definitely exceptions to this grim scenario, but they tend to just prove the rule.This will be a tough one for most people to accept or perhaps even really understand. To do so you have to look at *everything* differently and not accept anything at face value. People who do that are usually labeled \\"elite\\" and \\"pretentious.\\" And as \\"market democracy,\\" of workers who must expend most of their intellectual capital in pursuit and maintenance of their livelihoods, but with increasing disposable incomes, continue to grow (China, India, S. Korea, Brazil, Taiwan), look for kitsch, and the \\"received wisdom\\" contained in it, to increase.Furthermore, Kundera's despair, if I may call it that (for he doesn't, but I get that feeling from him) is that most people don't understand the difference, cannot distinguish kitsch, insincerity, even if you explain it to them, distinguish it for them. They are too lost in the realm of emotions, defending themselves from what they perceive as a personal intellectual attack, a \\"pissing contest\\" of the minds. It is supremely ironic, then, that it is they who call others who make this distinction \\"pretentious,\\" when the very meaning of the word reflects more upon them. By just fitting in with everyone else they are the ones harboring pretense, because they are just aping the behavior of everyone around them, or at the very least endorsing the superficial reality that Kundera discusses, and that he believes it's the novel's duty to overcome. This is a rather cerebral argument, however, and I don't expect it to resonate widely. If economics is the dismal science, art is the equivalent in the world of the aesthetic.And so it goes. Kundera has cogently summed up the dilemma of his, and our, age. The Sixth part alone is worth the price of the book, and the summation of his philosophy of art in the Seventh is brilliant, with a perfect finishing observation that puts everything he has previously said into perspective--in one sentence he smashes to bits the modern wisdom of the premise of cultural-relativism. After closing this book I felt like I had spent an afternoon with an extremely thoughtful person who had seen a great deal and thought deeply about it. One can see how the forces of Communism shaped his values and concerns--our market-driven ones of today are alien to him, and we are the poorer for it. Too bad there are so few, if any, Kunderas anymore. Yes, he's still alive, but at 79, he's hardly a new voice or fresh mind, and to whom he'll leave his intellectual legacy is anyone's guess. And many would consider such concerns to be pretentious anyway.Someone who previewed this review said it reads more like a philosophical discussion than a book review. That makes sense, since a philosophical discussion is precisely what Kunder'a book is. Perhaps a better title might have been \\"The Philosophy of the Novel\\"?"},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"In these brilliant reflections Milan Kundera discusses fundamental characteristics of the novel, its history and its immorality.The object of the novel is the enigma of the self (the subject) functioning in a world full of ambiguities, where all things human are relative.HistoryNovelists, like Cervantes, examined the self through its actions, which (partly) revealed the nature of the self.A new generation, like Flaubert, delved into the self's invisible interior life (dreams, the irrational) in order to reveal the self's secrets.Joyce dissects painstakingly the present.In fine, F. Kafka poses the ultimate question of what possibilities are left in a world where the external determinants become so overpowering that internal impulses no longer carry weight.Radical autonomyKafka's novels are the masterful proofs of the radical autonomy of the novel. By creating an extreme and unrealized possibility of the human world, Kafka expressed things about our human condition which no social or political thought could ever tell.ImmoralityThe novel is boundless freedom. It is not rational or based on verisimilitude.Novelists should use this freedom to discover unrealized possibilities of the human world. A novelist who doesn't unveil a hitherto unknown segment of human existence is immoral.These in depth meditations on one of the major components of human art are a must read for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"In this critical examination of the \\"art of the novel\\", Kundera meditates upon the existence or non-existence of \\"art\\" in novel-writing. It is a combination of narrative and philosophical ponderings highlighted by Kundera's famed lyricism. However, therein lies the the book's weakness. The dense language could lose your \\"average\\" reader and some issues, such as the meaning of art, begin to lean far more towards the philosophical rather than in analytical technique. Kundera tends to wander off on tangents."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"A highly interesting and introspective piece into the art of novel writing from one of Europe's finest contemporary authors, Mulan Kundera. His philosophical background is particularly impressive has he attempts to relate back the meaning of his work to existential and phenomenological origins in Husserl, Heidegger, and Nietzsche. I also particularly enjoyed Kundera's comparisons of literature to music in which he describes the forms of multiple Beethoven compositions as well as the basic structures of his own novels. This is an enormously stimulating read, though not necessarily helpful for the blossoming writer."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This book has the property of timelessness, much like the \\"writing on writing\\" that is seen in Eric Auerbach and Kenneth Burke. However, it is in no way literary theory, nor is it, contrary to what some of the other reviewers seem to believe, \\"philosophical.\\" It is a careful explication of the author's principles, not a grand theoretical schema. The instantiation of real human circumstances, ones deeply concerned with the problems entailed by Heidegger's in-der-Welt-sein, is what differentiates the novel from philosophy. It is nothing less and nothing more than a series of seven disquisitions on the historical development of the European novel.\\"The Depreciated Legacy of Cervantes,\\" serves to offer the substance for latter explication, meditation, and the occasional tangent. Its subject is the history and development of the European novel that is deeply rooted in existential concern. As Kundera says, \\"A novel that does not discover a hitherto unknown segment of existence is immoral.\\" He is careful to delineate the novel's uniqueness as a historical artifact, and sees modernity as closely tied to the regnant existential themes as those explored by Joyce, Kafka, Sterne, Gombrowitz, and Broch (a somewhat epigrammatic essay on The Sleepwalkers is contained herein). But Kundera sees the inaugural journey into modernity as one that is essentially Cervantes'. Don Quixote enters a world that has seen the weakening influence of religious dogmatism. His experience contains none of the certitude of categorical absolutes that were so indicative of earlier existence (again, that desideratum for novelists)."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"Kundera's \\"Art of the Novel\\" rings with the same provocative and bold insight that marks all his writing. He begins by exploring the unique capacities of the novel, springing from what he describes as \`Cervantes' depreciated legacy'. The novel, for Kundera, is the place where the whole non-Manichaeistic ambiguity of human experience - both banal and dramatic - can be explored. From this eagle-eyed view he moves to discussing the compositional techniques in his own novels, examines key writers from Central Europe and explores Kafka's work as the epitome of the \`anti-lyric' poetry which, for Kundera, is the distinguishing feature of all the great novels. He goes on to develop a polemical list of key terms that underpin this \\"Kunderesque\\" critique and finishes with the text of his 1985 acceptance speech on receiving the Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society. \\"It pleases me,\\" he observes in this address, \\"to think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of God's laughter.\\"Kundera takes up the themes of these essays again in \\"Testaments Betrayed\\" (1996) and revisits and hones them in \\"The Curtain\\" published in 2005. While all three collections circle around similar insights and obsessions, it is interesting to watch Kundera elaborate and distil the central preoccupations of his own novelistic impulse. Devotees of the work of Ren&eacute; Girard will find familiar themes here and Kundera acknowledges this debt to Girard explicitly in \\"Testaments Betrayed.\\"Don't expect a through-worked philosophical examination in any of these essays but do expect an impassioned and always engaging examination of the novel that cuts through a lot of the tedious claustrophobically self-referential tendencies of much postmodern criticism."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This is a good and insightful book. Because each chapter was written under different circumstances some may find it disjointed, but their is an underlying understanding of the novel that is coherent and profound. Kundera goes all the way back to Cervantes and show us how novelists have perceived and influenced the world down to our time. We pick up some central European novelists, like Hermann Bosch's trilogy, The Sleepwalkers, scandalously unknown in this country. Kundera shows us how novels occupy a role in culture were nothing else can go. A book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"In this book of essays, Kundera reveals an understanding of the progression of the European novel and his place in that progression.

It is more demonstration than exploration of what constitutes the art of the novel. More focused on a central subject (Kundera's production) than exhaustive object (the generalization \\"novel\\"), the book approaches its argument from several vantages and seems most interested in revealing something as close to the impetus to write as possible. The tone is that of \\"serious play.\\""},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"This book is amazing. Like all other books of Kundera (some I've read myself, of some read summaries and reviews), this book too conveys the simplest philosophies in the best of words.

A must read for all literature lovers and will certainly make an interesting reading for those looking for a different definition or dimension of oft-repeated terms in English."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"A light and heavy journey with Kundera along his personal aesthetic path that also takes in the road of the European novel.

Maybe they're amazing. Maybe. But judging from this book--and from some of the other reviewers who have posted here--I'd guess they're about as unpretentious as a pale, young intellecutal discussing the merits of W.G. Sebald and Friedrich Nietsche at a Cambridge, Massachussetts tea shop.This book DEFINES pretentious. The author knows you're an uneducated fool, and he will prove it to you.That said, he's not an idiot, and a lot of his pompousness is justified. If you don't mind having a thousand things quoted at you that you've only read half of, or the author's overall snobby tone, then you really might find some good insights into a the structure of books and the weaving of stories....Or, you might find yourself scribbling death threats to the author in the margins. ...Yeah, that's a bad habit of mine."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"I know I read this book. I read it all. I tried to learn about the art of novel- writing from it.I have just read the Amazon reviews posted about this novel. A couple are good. They tell me that Kundera writes here about Cervantes, Sterne, Balzac, Dostoevsky and Kafka. They tell me the book has a seven- part structure as his novels do. They tell me that Kundera contrasts the art of the novelist with the thought of the philosopher- and that for him the art of the novelist is in portraying ambiguity and complexity. They tell me that this particular book is one of his best.Now I have read other Kundera works. I know his work plays much with chance and infidelity and philosophical reflections by the characters on whether their disloyalty or love is bringing them to the incredible lightness of being which some seem bound to living in. They tell me too that the reflections touch about politics , Czech freedom, what it means to write under tyranny and what it means to live in the West.But the truth is I having read this work on the novel by Kundera remember not one single sentence or thought from it.This the impatient Amazon reader perhaps thinks says more about my own empty head than it does about the value of Kundera's work.But I now wonder if something in Kundera's world and way of seeing things, his kind of liberation, his kind of emphasis on the incidental and very secular do not repel this religious reader seeking to feel that all, even in the novel, should have some kind of deep and permanent connection with the One Source of all true meaning.It may be I have forgotten Kundera because his themes and understanding are ones I simply do not wish to know."},{"Title":"The Art of the Novel","review":"Well it so hard to pick a favorite Kundrea book because they are all so Brilliant, but I might pick this one."},{"Title":"Dreams, Dilemmas and a Dragon Named Charles: A Collection of Poems","review":"I've read the poems within, and the depth of feeling within them is impressive.

More than 160 years later, Frank Wilner has written the definitive treatise on the subject of railroad unification in this country. Wilner is well qualified to write such a work, having worked in the railroad field for 30 years, most recently as chief of staff to Surface Transportation Board Vice Chairman Gus Owen.Wilner's book is divided into four main parts, three of which jointly make up the main historical narrative consisting of 25 chapters. The fourth section is a series of six essays on related topics ranging from the author's explanation of the current workings of the Interstate Commerce Act to a hypothetical requiem for the railroad industry supposedly written one hundred years hence. The most interesting of these essays is Essay Four-Railroad Mergers: The End of History which compares the US experience with the railway privatization trend currently taking place abroad. A collection of 45 Rand McNally maps from 1939 is followed by more than 55 pages of endnotes and six appendices.Part One of the book, Chapters 1-8, starts with the opening of the Baltimore & Ohio in 1830 and continues through 1949. The author describes a railroad industry in its formative years when early lines began consolidating. Hundreds of these transactions took place during the 19th Century, including 428 between 1880 and 1888. As railroads grew in size to become a dominating force in the nation's economy around the turn of the century, the Federal government began to regulate the industry. Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887, and the passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and the Clayton Act in 1914. Passage and enforcement of the antitrust laws caused a reduction in railroad merger activity in the early 20th century. After the railroads were nationalized during World War 1, Congress attempted to force the ICC to create a plan for consolidating the nation's railroads into 21 regional systems. There was little support for this plan, or a subsequent depression-era 7-system proposal, from within the industry. During the 1930s, many railroads acquired financial control of others, bypassing the formal merger formalities. Examples of this include Southern Pacific's 1932 purchase of Cotton Belt and Chesapeake & Ohio's 1937 purchase of Erie and Nickel Plate . By 1940, the concept that the ICC could engineer a grand plan of nationwide railroad consolidation was discredited.The second part of the book contains ten chapters covering the postwar wave of mergers that swept the industry between 1950 and 1979 as railroads attempted to become more efficient in the face of subsidized road and air competition and lethargic and antiquated government regulation. These combinations included the Burlington Northern, created by combining the Great Northern, Northern Pacific and Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, and the ill-fated Penn Central, a combination of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central. The Penn Central fiasco rates four chapters in Wilner's book. He points out several reasons for the failure of the combined railroad, which Senator Claiborne Pell referred to as a \\"constipated monster\\". These reasons included a breakdown in operations and a overly generous labor agreement designed to eliminate union opposition to the merger. Noticeably absent was any mention of Penphil and Executive Jet, which Joseph R. Daughen and Peter Binzen cite as a major cause of Penn Central's failure in their 1971 book The Wreck of the Penn Central. The failure of Penn Central and the neighboring Lehigh Valley, Erie Lackawanna, Reading and Jersey Central railroads caused the federal government to pass the Regional Rail Reorganization Act which led to the 1976 creation of Conrail.Meanwhile, competing proposals by Union Pacific and Chicago & North Western to acquire the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific became bogged down in a bureaucratic quagmire that lasted more than a decade. By the time the now ineffectual ICC reached a decision, both UP and C&NW; lost interest in the deteriorating Rock Island, which filed for bankruptcy in 1975 and was liquidated in 1980. That same year, Congress passed the Staggers Act, which began to remove the dead hand of government regulation from the railroads.Part Three describes the post-Staggers era, during which today's large rail systems evolved. Wilner describes how the ICC, stung by criticism of the 12 year Rock Island fiasco, reduced the amount of time it took to approve mergers. During the early \`80s, two large southeastern systems were formed: Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX while two existing western railroads, Burlington Northern and Union Pacific, expanded their reach by acquiring neighboring carriers. Meanwhile, Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe's proposed merger with Southern Pacific was rejected after both railroads, anticipating ICC approval, had painted several hundred locomotives into a new paint scheme, causing the author to quote the old joke that the initials of the proposed railroad, SPSF, stood for \\"Shouldn't Paint So Fast\\". Wilner's one organizational mistake, in this writer's opinion, was to place the SPSF narrative at the end of Chapter 19, after he had finished discussing the post SPSF acquisition of SP by Philip Anschutz, who controlled the Denver & Rio Grande Western.One chapter is devoted to the shortline spin-off phenomenon, which has led to the creation of small railroads with more favorable cost structures operating on marginal branch lines which would have been abandoned if they had to be operated by the Class 1 carriers with their higher labor costs. Although not mergers, line sales have allowed the large railroads to concentrate on doing what they do best, operating high-volume main lines.Wilner finally brings us up to the first half of 1997 with chapters on the creation and privatization of Conrail, and the current plan of NS and CSX to jointly acquire and operate it. Burlington Northern's 1995 merger with Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and Union Pacific's acquisition of Chicago & North Western and Southern Pacific are described in Chapter 23. Of particular interest is a excerpt from a 1995 letter from Union Pacific's then-president Ron Burns to that railroad's customers:Many shippers are experiencing unprecedented problems with service provided by our railroad. I assure you that this critical situation has the utmost attention of all of us at Union Pacific.(T)he learning curve on the cutover [after acquiring Chicago & North Western] has been steep, and there have been some operations and systems slips along the way. As a result, service has deteriorated to a level never before seen on UP.A perceptive securities analyst named Scott Flower asked:If [UP is] flopping around with a railroad that . . . was their biggest interchange [partner], what are they going to do with a bigger property [Southern Pacific] that is suffering from an atrophying management?Wilner could not know that no sooner than his book went to the printers, that Union Pacific would develop indigestion from its acquisition of Southern Pacific. The railroad had three fatal accidents during the summer of 1997 and by October, portions of the system were paralyzed. For the second time in two years, UP officials were forced to apologize for lousy service. The unfortunate timing of UP's problems will mean that the proposed NS-CSX acquisition of Conrail will face extra scrutiny.Mr. Wilner has written the definitive work about railroad mergers in the United States. Hopefully he is planning to produce a revised edition reflecting the \\"mega-mergers\\" of the 1990s."},{"Title":"101 Ways to Market Your Books: For Publishers and Authors","review":"John Kremer is a genius.

This is fiction from an era we will not see again. This is the stuff little boys dream of! Read it, savor it and enjoy it! I cannot recommend this one high enough."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"I just finished rereading this remarkable adventure story, and must say, some of the capsule summaries above leave a bit to be desired.Yes, John Carter returns to Mars after 10 years absence, and finds himself in a paradise. But ironically, it's a paradise that soon turns into a kind of violent warring hell. The plant men are only the beginning. The bitterest enemies are a race of almost diabolical priests, the Tharns, who set loose white apes and plant men to slaughter thousands of religious pilgrims. I'm not spoiling the plot at all, since this becomes clear in the first two or three chapters.Again, there's a deep bond between the hero, John Carter, and a brave and stunning young woman named Thuvia. John Carter, a warlord, is not content to merely escape. He must somehow end this evil empire of hypocritical priests and mass slaughter.One fine element is the reintroduction of the green warrior chieftan, John's dear friend from the first novel in the series.There are strains of deeper thought woven throughout. For example, the biting satire against mindless &quot;fanatic&quot; religions.Heck of a book. Burroughs writes in a style that would seem a bit heavy today. But after a chapter or two, the reader usually can get in the stride. These books read fast-- you can't put them down. The heroines are GORGEOUS-- but the language is &quot;clean&quot; and the books can be recommended for teens. The description-- often in battle scenes-- is up to anything written in adventure science fiction today. This book was written-- amazingly-- in about 1917."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This book, #2 of 11 in Burroughs' John Carter series, is a direct sequel to the classic \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" and a reading of that earlier volume is fairly essential before going into this one. \\"Gods...\\" was first published in serial form in \\"All-Story Magazine\\" in 1913, and comprises one of Burroughs' earliest works. It is amazing how much action the author manages to cram into the book's 190 pages; on just about EVERY page there is some kind of incredible happening or colorful bit. The book really is hard to put down, and yet, at the same time, the end of just about every paragraph could serve as a cliffhanger! The pace of the book is brisk and relentless, and really carries the reader along to another great cliffhanger at the conclusion. In this volume, our hero, John Carter, returns to Barsoom after a decade's absence, and goes to that planet's \\"heaven.\\" But heaven turns out to be anything but, and our man gets caught up in battles with plant men and white apes, lost civilizations, religious taboos, the plots of an evil \\"goddess,\\" duels in the arena and on and on. There are two action set pieces that Burroughs really puts over well. One is the slave revolt that takes place halfway through the tale; the other, a bravura, four-way air battle between the forces of the black, white, red and green men of Barsoom. Both of these sections are thrilling in the extreme; better than anything in the first Barsoom novel. It's also nice that Carter, an Earthman on Mars, fights alongside men and women of varied races, colors, and religious beliefs in a common cause; there's some kind of message there--one for tolerance and brotherhood--that we could all avail ourselves of today.Having said all this, however, I must admit that there are problems in this novel that prevent me from giving it a top grade. These problems mainly take the form of fuzzy writing and internal inconsistencies. Burroughs, in this novel, does not do well in describing geography; his depictions of the Valley of the Therns, for example, are almost impossible to visualize (for me, anyway). A map of this planet (such as the one provided in LeGuin's Earthsea books) would have greatly helped, given Burroughs' inability to clearly set out his world. As for the inconsistencies: Burroughs, the \\"editor\\" of the novel, says he first read Carter's manuscript (for Book #1) 12 years previously; but if he had really obeyed Carter's will (that the manuscript not be opened for 11 years), then he would have only first seen the text of \\"A Princess of Mars\\" ONE year before! Tars Tarkas is said to be grieving over his kidnapped daughter in one section of this book; then, a few scenes later, he learns of this kidnapping for the first time. Huh?!?! The scene with Carter on the black-pirate cruiser contains many inconsistencies. Carter is said to be fighting five of these men; he kills three of them, and then three are left. Huh?!?! Six pirates are killed, all told, but later in the book, the number is said to be seven. Carter is said to have killed all these men single-handed, although the Thern princess, Phaidor, had helped him. These pirates are all asleep in the cruiser when Carter comes upon them, although they had been sacking the Thern temple scant minutes before. Does this seem likely? Inconsistencies such as this can drive an alert reader crazy. And don't even get me started on the redundant expressions such as \\"haven of refuge\\" and \\"craven cowards\\" that pop up all the time. Burroughs improved with age, but these early books are rife with problems that a good copyediting should have weeded out. Still, these minor problems are easily overlooked when one is caught up in the sweep of the story, and this story is as exciting as they come. It really is a tremendous feat of imagination, and one that any lover of swashbuckling fantasy should hugely enjoy."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"Having introduced the characters in 'A Princess of Mars,' the author gets down to the action, in this the second Martian adventure of John Carter, with, as I recall, a new opponent, ready to fight, on almost every page.The author subtly pokes fun at religion, race and our conventions and rituals regarding them, while writing an exciting adventure story that certainly gripped my imagination in the early sixties.John Carter remains the perfect Virginian gentleman, respecting women, seeking no unfair advantage, while fighting plants, animals and multiple races of Martians. He must struggle to overcome them all, if he is to set free his beloved Dejah Thoris from a nested series of &quot;Heavens within Heavens.&quot;If he wins, will he kill the &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; in the title? What will happen to religion on Mars if he does? If he loses...........An ideal introduction to science fiction and fantasy for boys reaching puberty.

When he revived he found himself back on earth, separated from Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium and his beloved. Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman. Knowing that it was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel. When Carter returns to Barsoom a decade has passed and he finds himself in that part of the planet that the natives consider to be &quot;heaven,&quot; which proves to be a more ironic idea. Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over. However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"People notice how ERB poked fun at religion in this book, but he ripped racism to shreds and made the reader laugh, cry, and want to visit Mars with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. Not even the evolutionists escaped the expert wit and satire of this masterful and entertaining epic story.John Carter returns to his beloved Barsoom ten years later, but instead of finding himself in Helium with Dejah Thoris he instead awakens in the lost Valley Dor, the Barsoomian heaven. But in reality it's a far cry from heaven and Carter turns a world upside with his challenging revelations.The real hero of the story, however, is Dator Xodar, a prince of the black-skinned First Born of Barsoom, the highest race on the planet. The First Born prey upon the white-skinned Therns, who in turn prey upon the nations of the Red and Yellow men of Barsoom. As Xodar learns from Carter that all men should be equal, Carter learns from Xodar that even the most feared Barsoomians can be a truly noble people."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"It would be difficult for this book to top its predecessor. In fact I would say this is a step down from A Princess of Mars in general quality. However, A Princess of Mars is, in my opinion, the best story ever written. If you're looking for an interesting, fun sequel, this book delivers well. John Carter returns to Mars after a ten year exile on Earth. There he is reunited with his old friend Tars Tarkas. Together they fight their way through the Martian &quot;heaven&quot; (which turns out to be a living hell) past giant apes, plant men and false gods. Along the way they meet new people, discover hidden races of &quot;gods,&quot; and find new quests.However, this book fails to reunite John Carter with his wife Dejah Thoris until late in the book (very late in the book). Their relationship was always my favorite part of the original, A Princess of Mars. Naturally, I am a bit disappointed in this. However, I feel that The Gods of Mars holds up better than most sequels--it is fun and exciting, and returns the reader to one of the most interesting worlds ever conceived in all of fiction.

When he revived he found himself back on earth, separated from Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium and his beloved. Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman. Knowing that it was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel. When Carter returns to Barsoom a decade has passed and he finds himself in that part of the planet that the natives consider to be &quot;heaven,&quot; which proves to be a more ironic idea. Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over. However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This second installment in Burroughs' Martian series surprisingly outshines A Princess of Mars. Sporting even more action than the first novel, it makes good use of ideas made mention in Princess. Add to it a cliff-hanger ending even more &quot;edgey&quot; than before, and you've got one of Burroughs' best."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"It'll be hard to write this review without including spoilers, but I'll give it a shot.The main problem I had with The Gods Of Mars is its inconsistent depiction of John Carter's intelligence. Carter's supposed to be this brilliant guy, a master strategist, a think-on-his-feet kind of fella who can puzzle his way out of any dilemma, no matter how difficult. So why is it that when he is presented with something so simple as the &quot;mystery&quot; of the identity of one of the major characters, said identity being so glaringly obvious that the reader has it figured out within a paragraph of the character's introduction, it takes Carter SEVERAL CHAPTERS to figure out who this guy is?This inconsistency (not the only one, I'm afraid), isn't really all that bothersome in and of itself, but it's problematic in that it (sin of sins!) takes the reader out of the story. In a novel like The Gods Of Mars, all you've GOT is story. Anything that takes you out of it is therefore a major flaw.I still enjoyed a lot of The Gods Of Mars, and will probably read The Warlord Of Mars (the next book in the series) if for no other reason than to see how TGOM's cliffhanger ending is resolved (yes, I admit it, I wanna find out). I just hope it's an improvement upon its predecessor."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The Viking lander in the 70's proved there was no life on Mars. If you just forget that while reading this book you will enjoy it from beginning to end. Gods of Mars takes place ten years after the first John Carter Mars book, A Princess of Mars, but you really don't have to read it to enjoy this one. Another note, this there is a John Carter of Mars movie in the works due out some time in 2006-(7?).

What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This continuation of the Barsoom series adds two more races of people to Martian life: blacks and whites. Despite being written prior to the civil rights movement in America, I felt E.R. Burroughs handled his depiction of black people remarkably well. He admits that black people are strong and beautiful, though they must ultimately be defeated and subdued by John Carter (like the other races).The hero's emergence as the undisputed ruler of all races through military prowess is still troubling. It is hypocritical for a man to condemn the Martians for their 'might makes right' mentality and call them heartless, and then conquer and pillage their cities.The pacing of action kept me interested throughout the novel, despite E.R. Burroughs' tendency toward verbosity. I rolled my eyes as each Martian declared their undying loyalty for John Carter and every woman swooned at his feet. John Carter was built up to be such a model of perfection that he seemed unreal. He was a super hero and not a real person despite the challenges he faced.Of course I am looking at this novel through modern eyes. Contemporary heroes have been transformed into average people that react in very human ways. It is perhaps unfair to judge this early fantasy character based on modern tastes, but I can't help thinking that John Carter would have been a more complete hero if he had shown some human weakness."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is, to me, that rare sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original story in a series. \\"The Gods of Mars\\" starts with the second death of John Carter on Earth and his subsequent arrival in the Barsoomian \\"paradise\\", the Valley Dor. It chronicles his escape from the Valley Dor and the White Barsoomians, the Therns, and his subsequent capture by the Black Barsoomians, the First Born, and his escape from the Lost Sea of Omean, the home of the First Born. As usual in the John Carter stories, he has to fight his way across Mars to find his \\"incomparable Princess\\" Dejah Thoris.

Well, obviously in a novel named \\"The Gods of Mars,\\" he isn't going to stay on his home planet. But Edgar Rice Burroughs' second Barsoom novel introduces a whole new dilemma for our hero -- how to get back to the world of the living.John Carter returns to Mars, but is shocked to find that he's in a completely unfamiliar part of it, populated by grotesque Plant Men and white apes. After encountering his old friend Tars Tarkas, Carter learns that they are in the Barsoomian afterlife. The problem is, nobody can return from the pilgrimage to the River Iss -- and if anyone tries, they will be killed.But the greatest threat comes from two breeds of Martian that Carter has never seen before -- the Black Martian pirates and the White Martian Therns, both of whom consider themselves to be gods.Anyone who survives the valley is turned into a slave, and Carter soon makes new allies among his fellow captives. But even if he can escape the grasp of the \\"goddess\\" Issus, he may not be able to survive in a world where escaping from \\"death\\" is blasphemy -- especially when he finds that Dejah Thoris may be doomed as well.\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is a much faster-moving story than the first Barsoom book, even though we're introduced to a whole new part of Mars and two new Martian species. Burroughs just plunges right into the main story right away, and it's a long time before he stops to contemplate the flora/fauna/customs of the Martians.Burroughs' prose is also more polished in this story, with longer action scenes and a faster pace -- as well as some moments that are absolutely horrifying (the plant men, with their corpselike skin, ragged noses and wormy hair). And while he still has the slight stuffiness of early 20th-century pulp, he injects a lot of vivid descriptions and action into the story.John Carter is still a bit on the Stuey side -- multiple women are in love with him by the story's end, for instance. But he's still a very strong character, with lots of guts and courage. Burroughs throws a rather unexpected twist into the story when Carter discovers that one of his fellow captives is actually related to him; and he also introduces some other interesting characters, such as the malignant Issus and the strong, proud Thuvia.\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is one of the few sequels that is actually markedly better than the original book. But be warned: it leaves you dangling on a cliffhanger that will leave you scrabbling for the third book."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The Gods of Mars+++++++++ caution contains what some might construe as spoilers++++++++++The Gods of Mars is the second book of the John Carter series followingA Princess of MarsThe Warlord Of Mars.In this book after John Carter's arrival, a boat of Green Martians arrive on the River Iss and are ambushed by the previously unknown Plant Men. The lone survivor is his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter.Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, rulers of Valley Dor, a white-skinned race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians of the outer world by disseminating the myth that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the beasts of Valley, the survivors enslaved by Therns.Carter and Tars Tarkas rescue Thuvia, a slave girl, and attempt to escape, capitalizing on the confusion caused by an attack by the Black Pirates of Barsoom upon the Therns. They are separated during the attack: Tars Tarkas and Thuvia hijack a Black Pirate flier, while Carter fights his way aboard another, killing all but one of the Pirates, and rescuing a captive Thern princess.Carter, talking with the captured Pirate Xodar, discovers that the Black Pirates, called the \\"First Born\\", also think of themselves as gods, and prey upon the Therns as the Therns prey upon others. He, also, discovers that the captive Thern is Phaidor, daughter of the \\"Holy Hekkador\\" (high priest) of the Therns. When their flier is recaptured by the First Born, they are taken to their land, built around the underground sea of Omean, below the lost sea of Korus and the Valley Dor. Both are located at the South Pole of Barsoom.Once there, Carter is taken before Issus, the goddess of Barsoom; an ancient, evil woman who has manipulated her own people and the rest of Barsoom into maintaining a hierarchy with the First Born on top. Issus dictates the policies of the Therns through secret communications with them. The Therns, thinking they are receiving divine communications, do not realize that they are duped by their enemies.Issus takes Phaidor into her service as a handmaiden for one Martian year. Carter is imprisoned, with Xodar as his slave as punishment for being defeated by Carter. Thereafter Carter treats him with honor, and thus gains in him a friend. In prison, they meet a young Red Martian captive from Carter's home country of Helium. Soon thereafter, Carter and the youth are taken to the monthly games of Issus.In the games, the handmaidens of a year before are sacrificed, and their bodies will be eaten by Issus and her nobles. Carter leads a revolt of the prisoners, killing many of the First Born. Carter and the youth almost kill Issus before the First Born suppress the revolt. Carter and the youth escape via underground tunnels, and give themselves up to guards unacquainted with the revolt to be returned to their prison island. Upon hearing the story of the revolt, Xodar rejects the notion of Issus' divinity.Carter, Xodar and the youth hijack a flier and escape. Soon after, Carter discovers that the youth is his son, Carthoris. The flier is damaged and must be abandoned in unknown territory. They encounter Thuvia, who describes the capture of Tars Tarkas by the green warriors of Warhoon (a clan rival to his own). Carter goes alone to rescue Tars Tarkas, but is discovered. After a chase, Thuvia is sent on alone mounted while the men attempt a last stand against the Warhoons. They are rescued by the Heliumetic navy; but do not find Thuvia.Commanding one of the warships is Carter's friend Kantos Kan; but the fleet is commanded by Zat Arras, a Jed (chieftain) of the hostile client state of Zodanga, and Carter is suspected of returning from Valley Dor, which is punishable by death. Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, the Jed of Hastor (the grandfather and father, respectively, of Dejah Thoris, and thus Carter's in-laws) are absent from Helium, having led fleets in search of Carter. Later, Carter discovers that Dejah Thoris is missing, believed to have taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find him.Upon returning to Helium, Carter is tried for heresy by the Zodangans; but the people of Helium do not tolerate this. To avoid civil war, Carter's judgment is deferred for a year. Sola, the daughter of Tars Tarkas, arrives, having escaped the First Born.Carter realizes that Dejah Thoris will be selected as a handmaiden of Issus, and thus will have only a year to live; wherefore he and his comrades go to rescue her. They uncover evidence that Thern spies are monitoring them, and Carter is kidnapped by the Zodangans. Carter refuses Zat Arras' offer of freedom in exchange for endorsing Zat Arras as Jeddak of Helium, and is imprisoned. After half a year in a dungeon, Carter wins his freedom through a ruse, and the mission to the land of the First Born is launched, with secretly raised troop levies, ships, and many troops lent by Tars Tarkas.Upon approaching the South Pole, a Thern fleet challenges Carter's fleet, and behind Carter's fleet arrive another fleet led Zat Arras. Finally, a fleet of First Born arrives, leaving the rescue mission for Dejah Thoris in jeopardy. Carter encourages the Therns and First Born to fight one another, and the Heliumetic crews of the Zodangan fleet mutiny in support of Carter. Carter then takes his remaining fleet with Tharkian troops to invade the underground sea of Omean.The combined Heliumites and Tharks defeat the First Born, and Issus herself is killed; but Dejah Thoris, Thuvia, and Phaidor, each of whom loves John Carter, are imprisoned in a room of the Temple of the Sun, of whose rooms each opens only once per yearThe Gods of Mars was serialized in five parts in All-Story magazine, the first part published in January 1913 and the final part published in May 1913.

John Carter the Earth born Virginian blood filled man returns back to Mars to claim what is his. None which means more to him than his beautiful Martian Wife. Not all goes well though as Carter returns to Mars, he finds himself in a part of the planet never seen by his own eyes. As a matter of fact the part of Mars he returns to is in fact what many Martians believe to be Paradise. Their own version of Heaven. All who make the journey to this great beyond do it freely, and are never seen again. Should they return from this paradise they find death waiting to be delt out to them by their own friends and family.John Carter finds this Paradise this Heaven to be a lie. A lie that has seeped into the very fabric of every species of Mars culture, belief, and ideas of life and death. So John Carter does what he does best. He test his metal against even the gods of Mars. He destroys royalty, fortress', and the so called Goddess of Mars herself. Shattering all ideas and beliefs of the Martian man, John Carter turns their Heaven, their believed to be \\"great afterlife\\" into a nightmare.

Tars Tarkas for example--John Carter's four armed, green skinned war chief of a best friend is just amazing. In some ways he is an even more interesting character than John Carter (his backstory in the first book is wonderful).This book picks up about where the first left off, ten years later, again introduced by John Carter's distant cousin--Edgar Rice Burroughs, pretending to be a Virginian. John Carter claims to have figured out how he travels between Earth and Mars and has prepared his young nephew for the upcoming excursion. (To a degree it reminds me of the Perelandra tales of C.S. Lewis, except MUCH better.)John Carter goes back to Mars, hoping to be reunited with his princess, Dejah Thorris, only to find himself having transported to the worse place on Mars to be. He has transported into the Dor Valley--essentially he is on his way to the land of the dead. In this book he discovers the 'truth' of the Martian spiritual beliefs, which up unto this time he had been content to respect.He encounters races that in his time on Mars before, had been unknow to him at all. There are white martians, the holy Therns--essentially a priest class, and black martians, the First Born, who are essentially an over pampered high class. He also comes face to face with the goddess of death, Issus.Its a great book, and the love between John Carter and Dejah Thorris is really well illustrated.Now on to the third, as the second left me wanting more and while it was 'wrapped up' it wasn't really."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"We last left John suffocating and wondering if we will ever see him again (except for those few intrepid people that dare to read ahead)\\"Twelve years passed since I laid the body of my great-uncle, Captain John Carter, of Virginia, way form the sight of men in that strange mausoleum in the old Cemetery at Richmond.\\"John returns to a Mars he never saw before yet soon finds old friends and new adventures.

This novel was published from January to May of 1913 in \\"All-Story\\" as a serial, and then published in book form in September of 1918. John Carter returns to Barsoom, finding if he were in time to save Barsoom at the end of the previous book, and searching for Princess Dejah Thoris who he left behind.As with the first book, this one opens with a foreword written by Burroughs, where he implies that this is a true story and that John Carter is real. The story then picks up with John Carter returning to Barsoom, but to an area which he has not seen before. He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \\"heaven\\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again. The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The cover to the Del Rey edition of _The Gods of Mars_ that I have at hand is a Michael Whelan painting of John Carter and Tars Tarkus fending off a mob of blue-skinned aliens with flat tails and medusalike hair. A giant boulder is behind them, two pale moons are in the sky, and a six-limbed white ape is on the edge of the action. There is a ring of mountains and cliffs in the background.This prompts me to muse a bit on Burroughs illustrators. The main illustrator of Burroughs first editions from 1916 on was J. Allen St. John. His sketches were somewhat rough, and his more detailed illustrations were muted paintings or washes. He was not, perhaps, a great artist, but he was a great Edgar Rice Burroughs artist. His style was Victorian, which matched the style and plot of Burroughs's romances.St. John directly influenced the art of two younger artists, Roy Krenkel, Jr. and Frank Frazetta, who did many covers and interior illustrations of Burroughs for Ace Books. Both Krenkel and Frazetta are, I think, technically superior to St. John. A measure of this is the fact that Krenkel won a 1963 Hugo for his Burroughs illustrations. Boris Vellajo is stylistically similar to St. John, Krenkle, and Frazetta. He is as erotic as St. John was Victorian, but he holds that eroticism a bit in check on all his Burroughs illustrations that I have seen.Whelan is a bit in this tradition in that his paintings are realistic. But Whelan's art is more \\"solid,\\" whereas the other illustrators used more sketches and washes. His style is more like that of Kelly Freas.In the early 1960s, Ballantine employed a series of artists-- including Robert Abbett, Neal Adams, and Richard Powers-- to give Burroughs's books a more modern, impressionistic look. The artists, especially Powers, were competent enough. But the attempt was abortive. Burroughs was not a modern writer, and a modern look simply did not go well with his stories.I do not pretend to have an encyclopedic knowledge of Burroughs illustrators, but I believe that a few generalizations can be made. Since Burroughs's heroes and heroines tend to be unclothed, handsome, and beautiful the illustrator should be good with human anatomy. (Frank R. Paul's stiff, jodhpurred people will not do.)There are lots of beasts, imaginary and real, in a Burroughs romance. The artist must be good with nonhuman anatomy as well. An old-fashioned, realistic style is more appropriate than a modern, impressionistic style. And lots of detail in the illustrations is preferable to artwork that is \\"sketchy.\\" The artist should make the setting \\"come alive\\" for the reader.But we seem to have drifted a bit from the novel itself. _The Gods of Mars_ was first published as a five-part serial in _All-Story Magazine_ in 1913 and was a sequel to _A Princess of Mars_ (1912), the first Barsoomian novel. At the close of _Princess_, John Carter is whisked back to Earth, with Barsoom possibly about to lose its atmosphere. In _Gods_, he finally manages to return and launch himself off in a series of new adventures. Some reviewers have correctly noted that Burroughs is careless about many details in this novel. But it seems to me that he is nevertheless quite good with his descriptive passages. Here is a sampling of some passages that seem to me to have a kind of dreamlike sparkle:As far aloft as I could see the stems and branches and twigs [of the giant trees] were as smooth and as highly polished as the newest of American-made pianos. The wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony, while their nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were azure, scarlet, or deepest purple. (13)To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach, before me only a vague, dim line indicated its farther shore, while at my right a mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me. (13)The face of the entire cliff was, as later inspection conclusively proved, so shot with veins and patches of solid gold as to quite present the appearance of a solid wall of that precious metal except where it was broken by outcroppings of ruby, emerald, and diamond boulders-- a faint and alluring indication at the unguessable riches which lay deeply buried beneath the magnificent surface. (21-22)For quite half an hour we descended [down a black chasm in a giant mountain] and then the shaft terminated abrubtly in the dome of a mighty subterranean world. Below us rose and fell the billows of a buried sea. A phosphorescent radiance illuminated the scene. Thousands of ships dotted the bosom of the ocean. Little islands rose here and there to support the strange and colourless vegetation of this strange world. (77)It was still dark when we passed the northern boundary of the ice cap and the area of clouds. Below us lay a typical Martian landscape. Rolling ochre sea bottom of long dead seas, low surrounding hills, with here and there the grim silent cities of the dead past; great piles of mighty architecture tenanted only by age-old memories of a once powerful race and by the great white apes of Barsoom. (121)Now _this_, by the double moons of Barsoom, is why you read Edgar Rice Burroughs!

Minor types, balloons and airships, gliders and foreign aircraft are dealt with by a photo or two and brief history.Add to that a very brief history of US Naval aviation, a detailed explanation of the five different designation systems used by the USN, markings an d colors, list of Navy aircraft by type (i.e. TB or F designations) and there isn't much this book does not have.Keep in mind, because of brief overview space limitations operational unit details are somewhat limited, usually just mentioning the first units to use the types or noteworthy incidents.I can also highly recommend a similar effort by the same authors, U.S. Military Aircraft since 1909.One note: the illustration of this book provided here is of the first (1968) and second (1976) editions.

I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's."},{"Title":"Old Rockaway, New York, in Early Photographs","review":"I would probably have given this book 5 stars if the Belle Harbor section (where I grew up in the 60's and 70's) had been better represented, but still, it was great to see the neighborhood I left as a teenager in 1976!For those that live --or lived-- there, especially if you spent any amount of time in Far Rock, you must get this book.To the authors: issue a revised edition with a more emphasis on everything West of Beach 116th Street... and I'll go 5 and a half stars in my next review!"},{"Title":"Old Rockaway, New York, in Early Photographs","review":"Simply the only printed information available about the Rockaways of yesterday.

You may think that these forced transfers do not cost very much money -- and if one takes each transfer at a time, he may be right. But taken as a whole, multiplied by the government's long reaching tenacles, they estimate that the government spends $400B redistributing.But if that was not enough, Laband and McClintock go on to demosntrate that this projected $400B is in reality an understatement; they cannot estimate the preemptive measures taken by individuals to protect their property from the government. For example, if the government used eminent domain to seize somebody's land, L&amp;M's model would not account for the costs of one hiring a lawyer to protect himself from coercive government. Forced transfers, thus, waste a staggering amount of money that would be better used in productive activity.This book is a timely economic complement to the moral argument against forced expropriation. The magnitude of the problem is exposed so convincingly that it should become a focus of attention for quite some time."},{"Title":"The Transfer Society: Economic Expenditures on Transfer Activity","review":"This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer."},{"Title":"The Transfer Society: Economic Expenditures on Transfer Activity","review":"How much time, money and resources have been allotted to influence how wealth is distributed in this country? Over $2,000 year for every individual, according to this title. The figure doesn't represent the amount transferred, but the amount spent on influencing transfers.

Intriguing and different."},{"Title":"Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices of the Rwandan Genocide","review":"Not as well known as some of his contemporaries, Robert Lyons deserves a wider audience. Having previously published two other books on Africa, with Intimate Enemy he has published his most mature work. Composed of mostly square format black and white portraits, the book is spare simple and without judgement.. It shows again how the larger forces of history and politics can make the best of people do the worst of things. Not an easy book to look at but well worth having."},{"Title":"Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices of the Rwandan Genocide","review":"Robert Lyons and Scott Straus, Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices from the Rwandan Genocide (Zone, 2006)By now, pretty much every one is aware of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, almost invisible while it was going on but the subject of a great deal of media exposure since. As with all such things, though, there's always another angle from which to approach it. Robert Lyons and Scott Straus find one (two, actually) with Intimate Enemy; show the genocide from the point of view of those who participated (in Lyons' case), or from every point of view there is to be had in Rwanda (in Straus').After two introductions in which the author and photographer explain their methodologies in collecting the material presented here, we get into the edited transcripts of a number of interviews Lyons did with genocidaires-- those convicted of genocidal behavior who freely confessed to their crimes. Simply put, they're fascinating. Reading them, one has to wonder how much of what's said needs to be taken with how much salt; there's a lot of language that sounds suspiciously like \\"I was only following orders,\\" but with a dash of \\"if I hadn't, I'd have been just as dead\\" added to it. Straus' photographs, presented with no context whatsoever (notes on the photos are presented in a separate section afterwards), are even more intriguing, since he juxtaposes mass murderers with innocent bystanders, judges, victims' families. (Despite what you read in some of the interviews, you won't be able to tell them apart.)Thought-provoking. Recommended. ***"},{"Title":"Intimate Enemy: Images and Voices of the Rwandan Genocide","review":"This very illuminating book shows us, through the descriptions of participants, what it was like during the Rwanda genocide. Photographic portraits made later show us other participants. Together they make a picture of yet another holocaust.The analysis of political scientist Scott Straus and the photographs of Robert Lyons exemplify the belief that objectivity is the key to understanding human affairs, social science. With it there is the hope that dispassionate, systematic analysis, like in the physical sciences, will provide understanding of and divergence from the destructive courses of the past. Straus uses the random sample; Lyons the straight-on shot. By striping away context, there is the promise that essences will be revealed. If Straus and Lyons had been able to observe the killings, instead of asking questions third hand, instead of photographing after the fact, would we better understand why people kill people? Terrorist videos with their fixed focus views are the closest we have to being present at horror. Yet when that wildly passionate, unprofessional radio announcer at the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937 says \\"This is terrible', we understand.

His dream is to become recognised as a master flutist. In Florence, he mixes in intellectual and artistic circles and has an affair with an aristocratic lady who redeems him in his own eyes. Like the majority of Lawrence's novels, the central theme is the relations between men and women, though this time, it is given a twist owing to Lawrence nourishing his mind on a reading of Nietzsche, who was then gradually becoming recognised in England. In his analysis of the concept of &quot;love&quot; between the sexes, Lawrence perceives it as a function of the will to power, a cycle of reciprocal domination and surrender, in which the man must conquer and the woman must submit. Elements of the rejection of the &quot;herd morality&quot; on Aaron's part and his endeavour at self-development are both ideas of peculiarly Nietzschean provenance. The fact that Aaron realises himself through music is another echo of Nietzsche, who regarded music as the purest and most supreme of the arts, in which the passions achieve immense gratification. The title refers to the rod of Aaron in the Old Testament, one of Moses's renegade priests who built the golden calf in the desert for the worship of the Israelites. The rod, his symbol of authority and independence, finds its echo in Aaron's flute, which is broken later in the novel during an anarchist riot. There is a price to pay, Lawrence seems to imply, for daring to oppose orthodoxy and to try to create a new life for oneself. Unlike Lawrence's more famous works, such as &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot;, which are both admirable for their rich, poetic prose, &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot; is drably written and occasionally tedious, with a narrative that is sometimes poorly connected, as it dwells on irrelevancies. However, the message, that of an individual fulfilling his duty to himself, is an encouraging and refreshing one."},{"Title":"Aaron's Rod","review":"Strangely, this was my first full-length D.H. Lawrence novel. Thankfully, I'd read enough of his short stories and essays to know that Aaron's Rod isn't indicative of his artistic capabilities. I was more impressed by the concept behind the novel than its execution. Essentially, Aaron Sisson's abandonment of his family and job in order to join a travelling orchestra is meant to symbolize the power and passion of &quot;individual freedom,&quot; &quot;personal friendship&quot;, &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;art&quot;. I think he only half-succeeds. Just as Aaron comes across as an &quot;incomplete&quot; man searching for meaning in post World War I Europe, I think the novel is too loosely constructed, and Lawrence's characters, too thinly drawn. But on a symbolic level, they are full of Lawrentian psychology. The characters of Rawden Lilly, Struthers, the Bricknells, and others all overtly represent various aspects of male and female polarities; however, they are un-memorable and sometimes difficult to relate to.I was hoping this would be more of an &quot;artist's novel&quot; containing interesting descriptions of Aaron's life in Florence with his bohemian friends, and to a certain extent it is, but Lawrence seemed more interested in symbolism than in telling a good story. Though scattered as a story, the concepts of individuality and society are clearly portrayed throughout &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot;, and towards the end, when the anarchist's bomb goes off, we sense a &quot;breaking&quot; (the blue ball/ornament at the beginning, and the flute/rod at the end) of an outdated mode of thinking (i.e. patriarchy, male dominance, etc.) in favor not necessarily of feminity, but an integration of the two. This particular Penguin edition has an excellent introduction and helpful end-notes by Steven Vine which help explain Lawrence and his symbolism to those unfamiliar with his works. I might re-read this novel once I've read more of Lawrence, and come back to it one day from a different viewpoint, but for now, I'd have to say that unless you're a real Lawrence afficionado, I'd hold off on this one until you figure out whether or not you like Lawrence enough to proceed to something as scattered, cold, and dry as this novel comes across."},{"Title":"Aaron's Rod","review":"If you've not read any Lawrence this is not the book to start with. It fails as a novel because there is no story to speak of, just a string of scenes to initiate discussion of the issues Lawrence wished to explore. Apologists describe it as picaresque, but there is far more unity to most novels that deserve that descriptor. Nonetheless, there are wonderful scenes that fitfully jar this book to life, Lawrence's admirable command of language, and a brooding homoeroticism aching to burst out.

A more \\"humane\\" depiction of the God of the witches, is to be found in starhawk's spiral dance, it is inspired, poetic and it helps the practitioner to understand better, and attune to the horned God.Even though some of the rituals presented in this book are of interest I only gave it one star because in the section appertaining \\"the war God\\", the authors have the ridiculous arrogance of retiring the God mars! and even write: \\"But war Gods today we can do without\\" and \\"we would do well to reject firmly mars\\", so according to this people, people from the aries sign, (such as myself), the holy sephira Gebura,( which despite their folly is holy) and those born under the influence of the \\"red ray\\" should not exist! For a practitioner, to think that he/she is wiser than deity, is the first step in the path of self destruction, one shouldn't forget the story of Lucifer, although I'am a witch,there is always wisdom to be found in the theology and parables of other religions.Having seen that woman in a video (Janet Farrar) and observing her demeanor, it is not difficult to realize that she probably thinks she can tell the Gods what to do and even retire them!Their anti-war position of this people is an impracticable utopia, a dangerous delusion which is only likely to create imbalance in the microcosm and in the macrocosm and render the practitioner vulnerable to forces darker than he can possibly imagine."},{"Title":"The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance","review":"+AH4-There are so many books on the Goddess (including the prequel to this one by the Farrars, the Witches' Goddess, which is good) but what about information about the God of the Witches?

Also includes recipes for foods and incenses that correspond with the God(s), photos and a dictionary of over 1000 Gods, past and present, and looks at the many faces of the God in history and mythology.

The first discusses God archetypes, the second presents rituals for various Gods, and the third is supposed to be an encyclopedia of Gods. The only truely useful part (for me at least) is part one.The discussion of God archetypes is pretty good. Some of the archetypes are better than others, but overall the Farrars' do a good job of presenting the material. A little more academic than most of the other books I have read on the subject. Presents the each archetype seperately but makes important connections between them. Written sort of as a series of justifications for archetypes.The second part gives short descriptions of each God and then provides a ritual. Many of the rituals are little more than long incantations. They are all written for covens and most cannot be easily adapted to solitary use. Still, the descriptions of the Gods themselves are interesting.Finally the third part is nothing more than a list of names. Many of the names say nothing next to them at all. Some of three or four word descriptions like &quot;God of War&quot; or &quot;Father of Blank.&quot; Arranged alphabetically instead of by culture or archetype so you need to know the God's name in order to look it up, at which point you only learn His name, something you already knew.A good read if you are interested in learning more about the roles of God archetypes."},{"Title":"The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance","review":"I love this book, yes, as a Wiccan, there are not a lot of books written about the God, but there are some, and this is by far the best.

As usual, they have given the pagan community another reference book that doubles as an inspiration as well."},{"Title":"The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance","review":"This book is well worth the time and effort. Our male divinites are a vital part of our beings and the Farrars have done a commendable job with this one. I say that this volume is a necessary part of any witches study.Some people will dismiss the entire work because of a postition they do not agree with (a reviewer below advises that this book is dangerous).In my view,I would think that most intelligent and understanding people in the craft will be able to utilize the information presented here as an asset to their own spiritual path. Even information that you feel is wrong is a gift because it can ,if you allow it to, help to strenghten your own beliefs.What in my opinion makes this book, along with all of her published works so valuable to our history is the fact that, like Starhawk and the Spiral Dance, Janet has grown and changed over the years.It is important for us, especially to those who are just setting out on the path to see and undestand how the Craft, modern paganism and Wicca as a religion have developed, stumbled and grown into what we have now, and how it will hopefully do the same as the years move on. As we grow as a movement and learn more about our histories we can only hope that others who are held as leaders in our communities will have the same courage shown by Janet and others to realize that some ideas and understandings no longer work.That being said, I would like to add this: If it were not for the Farrars,Gardner,Doreen Valiente, Raymond Buckland, Ed Fitch,Gavin & Yvonne Frost, Wicca would not exist.We must give honor and respect to those who helped clear the path for the rest of us no matter if we agree with them or not.What draws me to this path is that unlike the big-box religions,the pagan way is one that is and will always be evolving. If we allow ourselves to be open to change, growth and have an unconditional trust in the Gods, we will be able to become the people we were meant to be. And getting there is going to be the journey and adventure of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance","review":"i think this is a great book for no other reason than the God is generally overlooked in most Pagan traditions. however, this book doesn't do too much to overcome that fact. the section of &quot;war gods&quot; was a joke, showing the typical Wiccan preference for all things female. the invocation to Loki was laughable, while the invocation to Zeus was a play! and just for the record, if the Ferrars are so anti-war god, why on earth do they include any invocations to deities such as Loki Laufeyson, the god who brought about Ragnarok with his malicious deeds?!? just curious, really. i found a lot of the info in this book to be helpful, but some of the opinions and invocations made this book only &quot;average&quot; as opposed to great. i will say this though, it is worth it for the index of gods alone."},{"Title":"The musician's guide to independent record production","review":"Props to Will Connelly.

Being a master erotica writer the author manages to describe her life in a manner that takes the reader on a delicious and vicarious trip into a world that generally are only deep and hidden fantasies of most women ....This real life exploration of a sex slave/master relationship make these fantasies not only seem more plausible but also delicious ....."},{"Title":"Beauty & Submission","review":"What struck me the most all throughout the reading of \\"Beauty and submission\\" is the power and bravery behind Maria Pita's prose.

Every such mountain is a challenge scaled with intelligent and triumphant results.

Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."},{"Title":"Beauty & Submission","review":"I think one's like or dislike of this book will be largely dependant on whether or not he or she is into The Lifestyle.

That's a hard thing to do, considering the blatant contradictions between the author's actions and her view of herself. This book also seems like a feeble attempt to make more money off of the original, and a way to promote her other novels. A lot of the manuscript is just excerpts from her other books!However, I did finish the whole thing in about 4 days. It IS a page turner- even though my respect for the author diminished considerably with each passing chapter. Again- it's a matter of preference. She wants to \\"dispel negative stereotypes\\", but personally I felt even more afraid of delving into anything beyond vanilla after reading it, and more unwilling to ever be associated with anyone of that nature. If a man wanted me to drink his urine and give me enemas and do it all in the name of love- I'd have a problem with it. Again, I'm not judging. Whatever two consenting adults do together is fine with me. Just don't try to pass it off as normal, and don't pretend to be strong when you aren't."},{"Title":"Beauty & Submission","review":"I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she \\"quoted\\" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy.

It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child.

Kincaid points to the role of motherly love, and the bond to the homeland in forming the individual personality and consequently one's flow of life.My quote: \\"A human being, a person, many people, a people, will say their surroundings, form their consciousness, their very being; they will get up every morning and look at green hills, white cliffs, silver mountains, fields of golden grain, rivers of blue-glinting water, and in the beauty of this- and it is beautiful, they cannot help but find it beautiful - they invisibly, magically, conquer the distance that is between them and the beauty they are beholding, and they feel themselves become one with it, they draw strength from it, they are inspired by it to sing songs, to compose verse ...\\"A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I enjoyed this book though some of my friends had different thoughts. Overall I enjoyed doing business with you!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I loved this book. This is the first Kincaid novel that I've read and I really dig the author's repetitive style of writing. I could definitely identify with the main theme of the book, having lost my own mother as a teenager. You go through life looking for that type of love, always coming up short because nothing comprable exists to the love of a mother who truly loves her children.You blindly search for womanhood, without the guidance from what could have been your most instrumental teacher. I would absolutely recommend this work to any young woman who has lost her mother, through death or otherwise. I cannot wait to get started on my next Kincaid novel."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"When first buying this book I throught it was gonna be about the author's mother. The book is about this girl name Xuela, who's mother died giving birth to her. Xuela father gave her to the woman who washed his clothes, and only visted every now and then. Xuela eventually moved back in with him and his new family only to move again with another family. I throught Xuela was one of the strangest characthers i've ever read about. Her views on things were so strange. The other thing i didn't like about this book, it had no dialouge, which mean a lot of long paragraphs."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Set in Dominica, Jamaica Kincaid's 1997 novel \\"The Autobiography of my Mother\\" tells the story of its tortured lonely protagonist and of her attempts to imagine and project herself into the life of her mother, who died upon giving birth. The book is recounted in the first person throughout, and the narrator's life and her mother's life tend to be rolled up into one. Naming, names, and their lack get substantial attention in the book. The reader learns the protagonist's name about one-third into the novel. The narrator soliloquizes, as she does throughout the course of the story:\\" 'My name is Xuela Claudette Desvarieux.' This was my mother's name, but I cannot say it was her real name, for in a life like hers, as in mine, what is a real name? My own name is her name, Xuela Claudette, and in the place of the Desvarieux is Richardson, which is my father's name; but who are these people Claudette, Desvarieux, and Richardson? To look into it, to look at it, could only fill you with despair; the humiliation could only make you intoxicated with self-hatred. For the name of any one person is at once her history recapitulated and abbreviated, and on declaring it, that person holds herself high or low, and the person hearing it holds the declarer high or low.\\"Kincaid appears to have an ambiguous attitude towards Xuela. While the author symphathizes with and works to help the reader understand her, Xuela likely will win the admiration of few readers. She is largely an anti-hero. A novel, of course may be good and successful even if its main character is not. Accepting this reminder, \\"The Autobiography of my Mother\\" does not work.The narrative voice is of an elderly woman recounting a long life marked by lack of love. When her mother died, the narrator's father sent the baby to his laundress who cared for the girl in an emotionally uninvolved way for seven years. At the age of seven, after her father had remarried, Xuela returns to the home, where the girl's stepmother takes a rabid dislike to her. Xuela feels rejected by her father, with good reason, and she dislikes him for what she finds his lovelessness, selfishness and rapacity. A policeman, he gradually becomes rich through questionable schemings. As an adolescent, Xuela becomes pregnant and undergoes an abortion, rendering her unable to have children. She has several affairs, mostly with married men that she does not love, and one marriage to a man she does not love. She lives long enough to witness the deaths of her father, husband, and siblings. Xuela has an eye for colors, smells, scenery, fabrics, and animals. She possesses a strong, vivid imagination which frequently becomes indistinguishable from fact. She appears herself incapable of love, highly critical of others, and cruel. She is highly sexual in her relationships with men, but the strongest feature of her sexuality is auto-eroticism, described in painfully intimate detail. Her narrative is replete with social criticism, based on what she perceives as gross inequities resulting from gender, race, nationality, economics, colonialism, and history.The most striking feature of the book is Xuela's voice. She speaks in long rolling, allusive, and repetitive cadences. The primary theme is her mother, who, the reader is reminded at every turn, died after Xuela was born. The book has a circular form as events are first discussed briefly and then return in the book, sometimes many times, for further development and reflection. The writing at times is dreamlike and poetic, but it quickly loses its luster. The paragraphs and sentences tend to be of interminable length and highly repetitive. Many times, I found myself losing interest through the welter of details and the repetition.The tone of the book is solipsistic. The narrator too often appears almost to be muttering to herself. The voice wants to convey a certain toughness and hardness in the face of difficult experience. The overall impression, however, is of self-pitying and whining. I wanted to disengage from the character and her story. I didn't trust the narrator or her judgment enough to be convinced of the many levels of societal criticism in this book.The book has a seriousness of purpose and tries to jar the reader out of a sense of complacency. Unfortunately, the narrator, her attitude, and her voice, get in their own way.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I have to speak up, because I feel that this book is being unfairly trashed. I stumbled across one of the chapters of this book in a collection, and I was so taken aback that I had to rush out and get the complete novel. I think that that Jamaica Kincaid's writing is so beautiful and poetic that she could be writing about anything and I would read it. But she also tells a very interesting and important story. Xuela is a mixed-race, motherless girl who does not receive love from anyone, and must survive by loving and celebrating her self. Perhaps for those people who have always felt secure in their place in life, and surrounded by love on all sides, Kincaid's book is too harsh and hard to relate to. But for those of us who have had times we when we felt so alone that we literally had to become our own mother and/or our own best friend, Kincaid's novel is a testimony to our experience. A great book."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Having read this title while vacationing in Jamaica, (even though placed in Dominica and the author grew up in Atigua)I was entirely able to understand Xuela. Many children are born out of wedlock, though the fathers still are involved with their children. Xuela is an extreme, but not implausible, case of emotional detachment. Everything in the book, from her father's corruption, to encountering the stevedore during a downpour came to life in my reading experience. Be forewarned, Xuela is not a likeable character, and her physical self-love may be offensive to some readers. But Jamaica Kincaid's blunt and honest portrayal of a hardened woman is undeniably hard to forget."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I think more readers should read this in context of Jamaica Kincaid's own personal life, especially regarding her torn relationship with her mother. It would then become extremely touching, as Kincaid really writes this to save her own living. While other reviewers have found this book to be harsh or dirty in some sense, we should gain the sense that this narrator is really at a loss for love, that there is so little to love, but was able to find love in herself."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Jamaica Kincaid's work always provokes sentiment for me. As a fellow Caribbean native, she describes some deep darks truths about people. . .truths that are consistent only among Caribs as they are influenced by thier social and cultural norms.In this novel, the mother's character, at parts, seemed much like my own mother: Having a dream of a better existence, but having it crushed by a woman whose dreams have also been diminished. And thus, a vicious cycle within a society of women who never seem to truly live; instead, only exist to raise other crushed little girls to yield even more unfulfilled woman.Don't look for any made-up or whimsical fantasies here. You will find yourself precisely where little secrets lie. . .in places you will only visit by way of Kincaid's chariot."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"The Autobiography of My Mother is not an autobiography at all, and it is not even solely about a mother. It is actually a novel about a woman whose mother died when she was being born. This first life event, which is also the first event the narrator tells the reader about in the story, is a powerful force that shapes the narrator's life.Not only does narrator (Xuela) not have a mother, but she feels that she does not actually have a country, a homeland. She lives on the island of Antigua, which is only twelve miles long and nine miles long. The culture of her people was stolen by their English colonizers, and the only culture they now know is that of England.In my opinion, there are times in the book when the narrator is self-pitying and repetitive. I do think, however, that this is in keeping with her character. The book is written as if Xuela is sitting down with the reader and telling him or her her life story, and Xuela would definitely be a character who would repeat and overemphasize the bad parts just so the person listening would get the point.I also found fault with the narrator because she was very hyprocritical. She critized her father's actions and attitude about life, but then she acted in simliar ways and had a simliar attitude. The one positive aspect about the main character is that she is a very strong woman who is not afraid to deviate from her society's acceptable ways of behaving.I was surprised that I liked this book so much when I did not like the narrator. I think it is because Kincaid had such an integrity when it came to writing about the main character. She presented all aspects, positive and negative, and didn't only show her in a good light. All aspiring authors can learn a lesson in characterization from reading this book.Kincaid's writing style is very seductive. It pulls you in and makes you not want to get away. I read this book in two long settings because I didn't want to put it down. She has a powerful way of describing people, places, and situations. Her prose is lyrical and truthful - after reading a passage, I wanted to sit back and think about it for awhile, because there was so much truth and beauty to be found in it.This is the first book I have read by Jamaica Kincaid. I am presently reading \\"A Small Place\\", and hope to read the rest of her books in the future. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to writers who are interested in reading very high quality writing with strong charactarization and powerful description."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"My feelings are very mixed about this book. There is no doubt that Kincaid has the ability to weave together beautiful and thoughtful moments. However, I had a difficult time staying interested in the book.I understand the book to be written in the style of the characters history, experiences and misfortunes . A child raised without love, who grows into a woman without the ability to love. Life without love becomes a life filled with philosophical insight on human behavior, love and death.Overall, the main character's inability to rise above an emotional flat line kept me disconnected, which prevents me from recommending this book with too much enthusiasm. I didn't feel that the character's description of the events matched her bleak emotional landscape."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"If you understand the culture of the Caribbean, then you will certainly understand, and enjoy this book. As I read it, I remembered all the intresting characters from my childhood that resembled the characters in The Autobiography of My Mother. Jamica Kincaid's style is so richly descriptive, it takes you \\"home\\" again. Xuela is a very strong female character, and although fate has made many of her choices for her, she ultimately takes control of her own destiny. A very good read, as are all her other works."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"It is difficult to rate Autobiography of My Mother fairly; Jamaica Kincaid has written excellent books - At the Bottom of the River, Lucy . . . - and this book is only well above average. Were my expectations not so high, the things that are right about the book would stand out more against the portions that don't work. She is at her best when portraying the inability to love and the bitterness at the colonialist religion. However, there are points in the story where the political portrayal of victor vs. vanquished becomes a polemic out of character of the protagonist. A good book that is well worth reading - but is probably more enjoyable if you have read Annie John, Lucy or One Small Place so that the political polemic fits the reader's growing knowledge of the author rather than simply being an element less adroitly handled in this particular book."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Autobiography of My Mother is a powerful, mesmerizing, and other-worldy tale of Xuela, a woman of Dominica, West Indies, who is a worthy subject for Kincaid's musical cadences and rapturous prose. Boy, can this woman write - and she infuses all her prose with the lilting voices of her compatriots. There's no way to read her work aloud without finding yourself lapsing into the patois, sing-songy style of speech that comes thru so clearly in her writing. This book is a painful tale, the recounting of a difficult life without much love shown to the girl as she grows from motherless infant to strong and bitter young woman who aborts her pregnancy and remains defiant the rest of her life. Raised motherless herself, she determines never to mother others. Taken on a metaphorical level, the woman's story could be the story of Dominica, torn by suffering, racism, power, and the unbreakable bonds that bind them together.Powerful writing on so, so many levels."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This book carries an empowering message that every woman can benefit from about embracing one's femaleness and sexuality. It is sad that some readers are frightened and offended (these two emotions go hand-in-hand) by the exploration of the body's potential for pleasure and power; this fear is exactly what Kincaid would like her readers to move away from. Women are taught from early childhood onward that their bodies and sexuality are shameful, but the protagonist in The Autobiography of My Mother teaches us that the body should be celebrated, rather than shunned. This world would be a healthier place if all of us adopted such an attitude."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This was the first book by Jamaica Kincaid I have read. If this book is an indication of Ms. Kincaid's other works, it is also likely to be my last. I read the book while vacationing on the island of Dominica, where the book takes place. Dominica is strikingly unique, but I doubt I would have realized this fact solely on the basis of Ms. Kincaid's description of the place, which is so vague that it suggests she has never been to Dominica. But my greater concerns are with Ms. Kincaid as a writer. Throughout the book, she proves herself to be possessed of few literary devices, repetition (for effect?) foremost among them. How many times must we be subjected to descriptions of &quot;saliva leaking from the corner&quot; of a character's mouth, or &quot;the wetness between my legs&quot;? Perhaps there is imagery in the book that only a woman, or a poor woman, or a poor Dominican woman, can understand -- as for me, her repetition added no meaning to the character development or plot. As for the plot, someone should disabuse Ms. Kincaid of her notion that unmitigated misery and psychological negativity are sufficiently engaging to justify the publication of a book. I shall do my best to communicate this to her by not purchasing any other of her products."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This was the first book I've read by Jamaica Kincaid and it will be my last.This book was not only BAD it was depressing. Xuela didn't loved anyone because no one loved her. She was a bitter and angry person. The line &quot;I did not know my mother because she died at the moment of my birth&quot; was repeated about 100 times throughout the book.I don't know why the book was named &quot;Autobiography of my Mother&quot; because she never knew her mother and constantly throughout the book said so. She hated her father because he was in a position of &quot;power&quot; and took advantage of others. One other thing that bothered me about this book was her habit of touching her private parts in public and smelling her hands after. I found this hard to believe, that Xuela would be so &quot;free&quot; in Dominica at the time period in this book. Touching ones self is taboo among most black people, whether you're born in Africa, America or the West Indies.The only interesting part about this book is when her lover's wife confronted her in the street.Maybe if the book wasn't written in such a &quot;defeated and depressing&quot; way it would have been better but the author's tone contridicts Xuela's &quot;I-don't-care-about-anyone&quot; attitude. Xuela stated she was content or happy with herself, but the tone didn't suggest that at all."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I found the book to be uneasy reading. I am widely read, but try as I might, I had to quit reading about 1/2 way through."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Excellent. Kincaid has an ability to shape words into vivid pictures. She makes me want to try to do it myself."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Although her story may not leave one with a warm feeling for Dominica, just reading this book made me ache for the places in her story, and I see every inch of the road, the mountain, the sea, like it was in front me. She weaves it all together into sad life and yet, how can you not long to see Giraudel and Mahaut, Trois Piton, and all deep green of that mystical place. I read it over and over and over."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This book leaves me restless and mixed up. I don't like it and yet I can't stop thinking about it. The narrator Xuela tells us how pleased she is with herself, she repeatedly deplores the emptiness and cruelty of life and she describes all the women (not the men) she's lived with in a spiteful manner. This mixture incites my anger. I don't like this Xuela, she doesn't reveal some missing links holding the different aspects of her personality together. However, she doesn't have to, it might be part of her strength to keep herself a secret - or is it just a weekness of her creator, Jamaica Kincaid, who hasn't really worked out this character? What really disappointed me was the fact, that no effort is spent on finding out more about Xuelas mother, who figures prominently in the title of the book but only marginally inside. The explanation at the end doesn't satisfy me: &quot;This account of my life has been an account of my mother's life as much as it has been an account! of mine ... In me is the voice I never heard, the face I never saw, the being I came from.&quot; It's an arrogant statement annihilating the mother's life. But that's not unlike the character of this narrator. Maybe the strength of the book is, that Xuela still doesn't leave me alone and stirs me to think about how I react to women who approach life in a very different way from what I do or would like to do."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life. I was left wondering what these aspects of the book had to do with the character's mother."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I &quot;attempted&quot; to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot;, I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found &quot;Autobiography of my Mother&quot; completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white &quot;conquerers&quot; for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Jamaica Kincaid's most recent book, The Autobiography of My Mother, is a poetically rendered account of a woman's journey through loss, longing, hope, and strength.

The work questions our distinctions between poetry and prose, fiction and autobiography, the personal and the political. This book is a sensual and intellectual pleasure"},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Losing a mom - never knowing your mom - living your life in anger. Sad. No redemption.

But 3/4 through the book it all becomes too much and clouds the storyline."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and I especially liked that the subject matter of the book was unique and unusual.The main character is not likeable, but yet the reader is drawn into her story and although she is quite wooden, you can feel her pain.My only criticism of the book is that it would have been better if it had been longer. I would have like to have known more about the characters.The writing is gorgeous and rich and it is very sensual. I think this is a very good book and I recommend it. It is not a typical read. It is unusual and unnerving in some parts, but I believe it is a true, honest and real portrayl of a woman very emotionally damaged."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This is my favorite of Jamaica Kincaid's, which of course is saying a lot. It is simply amazing. More complex and involved than her usual writing, it is a &quot;hard&quot; read, but definitely worth it. Also, if you ever have a chance to hear her read, it is amazing, and you will never read her in the same way again."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Wonderful book! This book synthesizes the experiences of a young woman growing up on a Carribean Island. It provides a point of view into a world few people experience or understand: that of a young, sensual female and her coming of age. In a world dominated by white males, racial tensions and lack of racial identity, it's refreshing to see and hear the experiences of a culturally diverse, hybrid woman. And that's from a sociological perspective-- I don't even get into the artsy sensuality of this wonderfully written book! Anyone who read this book and cannot empathize with the woman and the plight of minorities is, well, cold-hearted!"},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"This amazing novel succeeds at its ambitious and worthy goal which, in my view, is to show with precision - intellectual, emotional, visual, auditory, olfactory - the sinister mechanism and the devastating results of maternal abandonment. Kincaid's narrator suffers a grievous loss, and the circumstances of her life reinforce and magnify that loss. No one has ever protected her and she hangs onto life by a thread. Though amidst &quot;family,&quot; she is truly alone in the world. Franz Kafka wrote that one should only read novels that hurt, because those are the works that raise consciousness. This straightforward and skillful novel is replete with imagery of anger, sadness, and layers of detail that provoke utter despair in the reader - and that's just Kincaid's point. Kafka would have approved of this gripping story."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I think this is the general consensus from the reviews gathered here, but I will add my voice to the chorus, so to speak. This book is haunting. This is not one of those books that you forget about as soon as you've finished reading the last page. I've personally never been to the Caribbean, and I do not think I will ever be able to personally visit Rousseau for instance, but Kincaid's literary ability to make the descriptions jump off the page is something to be admired. there is a caveat to all of this of course. This book is not for the faint of heart. There are portions of this novel that are quite graphic, and that is putting it lightly. That is not to say that it distracts from the work itself, merely that it is there, and certain sensitive readers may take affront to it. This is a rich text that can withstand multiple readings, because you find something new every time. I came to this novel after reading. In a previous work \\" A Small Place\\", and gratefully on my part, the author was redeemed in my esteem. Not that I'm someone of any great import, but I had completely sworn off the author as someone I could never enjoy. this book is really hard to describe beyond the utter basics to someone who has never read it. in order to do so, I would need to commit a great disservice to the book and the author. There are elements of, biography and autobiography as well as magic realism, and what could possibly be construed as a cultural critique of the West. It is not necessary to see each and every one of these threads to enjoy the book, I merely use this as a way to comment that the author certainly has an intellectual project in mind.of course, this review is not an introduction to English. sufficed to say, this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"The author's intense focus on the main character's inner thoughts and feelings limits the reader's scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the book's setting. It was difficult to sustain an interest in the narrow range of concerns that surface in the exhausting detail flowing from the character's mind."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"this Book takes you on a journey for knowledge and understanding. it speaks to gaining something that is powerful that will be a stepping stone for better days and times ahead. this Book deals with expierences and coming to terms with life and how it has been dealt and the choices that you have to make.alot of issues and challenges are met head on and dealt with. very strong and well written book."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I did not like this book at first. I found it overwhelming and disturbing, but then I realized that I could not put it down. It touches son a subject that it not often talked about in the open. How a child feels after the loss of a parent and the abandonment of another. This book was well written and did exactly what is was supposed to do, making me think and feel for the character. This is not a book for everyone."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"I loved this book. This is the first Kincaid novel that I've read and I really dig the author's repetitive style of writing. I could definitely identify with the main theme of the book, having lost my own mother as a teenager. You go through life looking for that type of love, always coming up short because nothing comprable exists to the love of a mother who truly loves her children.You blindly search for womanhood, without the guidance from what could have been your most instrumental teacher. I would absolutely recommend this work to any young woman who has lost her mother, through death or otherwise. I cannot wait to get started on my next Kincaid novel."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Kincaid shows that she's a talented author. THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MY MOTHER is beautifully written. It's not about her mother at all, but about the search for knowledge about this woman that she never met. And thereby a search into herself (well, into the character's self). It's quiet. She even describes ugliness quietly. &quot;I long to meet the thing greater than I am, the thing to which I can submit.&quot; I was able to sink into it as I read it, but the book didn't stay with me after I was done."},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"},{"Title":"Autobiography of My Mother","review":"Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the &quot;wetness between [her] legs&quot;, or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."},{"Title":"A Piece of Paradise: A Story of Custer State Park","review":"I truly enjoyed the pristine and perceptive photography combined with the accompanying narrative.

Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book."},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on War","review":"This is a collection of essays and op-ed pieces previously published in books, magazines, newspapers, etc.America is primarily the country of interest here, though other Western powers are related as well.That said, this is an excellent collection. Energetically all of Zinn's writings stem against the massive tides of bureaucracy, imperialism, racism, big business, atrocities, irony, patriotism and militarism. He adeptly argues against the hypocricy of the past and the present in what I felt to be anticipation of a truly just future. His ultimate point being the need \\"to achieve justice, with struggle, but without war.\\"Most the writings are concerned with World War II and Vietnam, be it policies, battles or each wars place in history. WWI, Korea, Gulf War I, Kosovo and Yugolsalvia are also written about. As well, modern politics is engaged throughout and then illuminated in the final chapter, titled Beyond Machiavellianism which includes two expansive and frightening essays on U.S. Foreign Policy and the notion of a \\"just war\\" versus and \\"unjust war.\\"This is a call to common sense, pacifism and equality. Zinn presents all of his arguments against a morality that speaks to accountability, responsibility, hope, truths and the imperative of the citizenry to inform themselves and not senselessly accept our leadership's habits or predelictions.A good introduction to Zinn."},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on War","review":"In this collection, Howard Zinn, a reputable historian and political activist, has compiled numerous essays and articles regarding the hypocrisy of global foreign policy and the lunacy/horror of war.Zinn's analysis digs through the surface rhetoric and explanations given by governments in regards to the wars and imperialist tendencies that fuel the power of these nations. He exposes the deeper truths that guide nations' foreign policy agendas. His article, Aggressive Liberalism, illustrates the two-sidedness of American foreign policy, citing the numerous acts of unchecked aggression that the U.S. has unleashed on smaller, weaker nations. One of the most interesting thoughts expounded by Zinn is the belief held by many Americans that the U.S. is seeking to improve the interests of these occupied nations through the use of American imperialism.However, Zinn doesn't overtly slam the &quot;American way of life,&quot; or the institutions of America. Rather Zinn makes his statements through careful study and cites irrefutable evidence supplied by history in supporting his claims.Although Zinn is a dissident that sticks in the craw of more conservative America, his essays and article provide much food for thought, regardless of ones position on the political spectrum. This collection will certainly fuel discussion on a variety of topics."},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on War","review":"I am a great admirer of Zinn's brand of radical politics as well as his revisionist history. Here he collects a series of his anti-War essays into one slim but excellent volume. Never have I seen the case for pacifism made so well, recommended to readers of all political stripes, even if you disagree with Zinn's notions you'll find the book insightful and easy to read. I especially enjoyed the WW 2 parts, since this is typically viewed as a 'good war'.Zinn is despised by traditional historians, especially conservative ones, mostly for daring to hold unorthodox views, as a rule such talk seems ill founded. However he is also criticized for the sloppiness of his scholarship, and I was disturbed to find an example of that here, Zinn says:\\"Bombing Ethiopia in 1935, Mussolini's son-in-law Count Ciano described the explosions as an aesthetic thrill, having the beauty of a flower unfolding.\\"The quote that Zinn refers to is from Vittorio Mussolini, Mussolini's SON (who wrote a book called Flying Over Ethiopian Mountain Ranges) and not Ciano, here is the actual quote:\\"one group of horsemen gave me the impression of a budding rose unfolding as the bomb fell in their midst and blew up. It was exceptionally good fun\\"In a sense, this does not detract from Zinn analysis, since he was commenting on something that was actually said, and making a point about how fascist regimes glorify war. The point is still valid, even if Zinn has attributed the quote to the wrong Mussolini relative. It is disturbing in that it displays certain sloppiness with the facts and a relative unfamiliarity with prominent figures of the period."},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on War","review":"This is one anti-war book I wish more Americans would read. The policy of continual foreign war carried on by this country is one I would like to see changed and reading this book helps clarify the issues."},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on War","review":"humans with their intelligence should be able to talk about solutions to big problems without slaughtering each other.wars should should be as disgusting as cannibalism!humans should grow up....finally"},{"Title":"Howard Zinn on War","review":"Most people still think of patriotism as inherently conservative or right-wing and denoting only positive and supportive attitudes towards one's country. Or in other words, patriotism itself is an expressed opposition to dissent and to critical discourse. This popular understanding of what it means to be a patriot amounts to nothing more than jingoism. When it comes to war this is the only definition permited by media and (most) Americans to be openly and safely expressed. A good, patriotic American fully \\"supports the troops\\", supports the march to war, and continues their support for the war, no matter what, until victory is declared at which time we are then to cheer for our troops and praise our leaders.But moral problems can arise if you manage to think. There are questions... One issue that arises, or at least *should* for us Americans, is that of democracy. What does that mean? How does that fit into popular expressions of patriotism? And what about war? Is it always such a good idea? How much do you know about war? The causes, it's history, it's cost. Reading Howard Zinn can only help improve one's understanding and this collection of essays serve as a good introduction to Zinn's work while expanding the reader's knowledge of history and the phenomenon called war."},{"Title":"The Simple Book: An Introduction to Networking Management (Prentice Hall Series in Innovative Technology)","review":"This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to &quot;refine the semantics&quot; of a &quot;data object&quot; and that &quot;it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII&quot;. The author also notes that the &quot;ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex&quot;. (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."},{"Title":"The Simple Book: An Introduction to Networking Management (Prentice Hall Series in Innovative Technology)","review":"I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy.

It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the &quot;network management community&quot; anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic.

When you have no idea of an RFC, no idea of the hierachy of ITF's, ETF's, IANA, and what 1.3.6.1.1 etc. means, then this books helps you a lot. You need not understand every page of it, but you can catch the basic idea and what is behind SNMP. What can you ask more. And this is perfect for an \\"introduction\\". In light of the success of the SNMP-approach, this has to be considered. I have read all the reviews, which are addmittedly over 10 years old and must say: this is definitely not my view. The book helped me a lot and I am thankful for that. Some chapters can be more easily understood than others.

None-the-less, anyone reading Icerigger and Mission to Moulokin will have to read Deluge Drivers, if only to spend the last few minutes available with our new friends the Tran.

It gives an excellent overview of various mathematical and computer science areas, including but not limited to combinatorial geometry, NP-problems, complexity theory, graph theory, algorithm analysis, dynamic programming and even computational geometry.Most of the chapters are intended for a senior level undergraduate and graduate student, but some (such as part 4 devoted to complexity problems) are more suitable for &quot;mature&quot; audience and require some preliminary knowledge in the area.I found chapters on sorting, data structures, recursion and functional programming well written and structured, and examples to be practical as well as informative.Sections on amortized analysis, randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms and iteration improvement deal with current directions in the algorithmic research and provide an excellent overview of the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; in these areas. I also enjoyed reading through the section on greedy algorithms (shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems).Section on computational complexity and analysis of the relationship between complexity classes seems to be a bit complicated, those who are interested in this area should probably do some preliminary reading.The last section on computational geometry (my area of expertise) and applications of Voronoi diagrams could be extended, but even in the current state it givs a pretty good idea of what computational geometry is all about.Overall, I give to this book a &quot;5 star&quot; review and recommend it for anyone who is seriously interested in learning exactly how algorithm design and analysis work. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and can only wish that author would write more books like that in the future!"},{"Title":"Algorithms: Design Techniques and Analysis (Lecture Notes Series on Computing)","review":"This is a great book overall, but I give it 4 stars as it lacks the mathematical explanations that I personally was looking for. I am graduate student in Computer Science and a E-Commerce Consultant by profession. This book is more detailed than the Sedweick (I can't spell his name) in the sense that it has some more of a mathematical approach. It lacks the level of explanation that the Sedweick book provided. It has some math, but overlooks some steps thus targeting someone with a pretty solid math background, not someone with sophomore level undergraduate math background.Overall.. if you're a student taking an algorithms or advanced algorithms class (especially a graduate class), you might want to invest in this book."},{"Title":"Algorithms: Design Techniques and Analysis (Lecture Notes Series on Computing)","review":"I have studied both undergrad and grad algorithm courses from this book at KFUPM.

I have used this text often in business ethics courses, and students are provided with thorough analyses of the philosophical issues raised by corporate responsibility, freedom in the workplace, preferential hiring--the big questions. What is especially atractive is that each author wrote a chapter for this book, as opposed to the book's being composed of essays culled from other publications. So, the pieces are intended for classroom use. This book is especially useful for the an instructor who has in mind a &quot;philosophical issues raised by business&quot; approach for a course composed primarily by philosophy students. The weakness of the book is that the lack of case studies, examples of corporations' codes of ethics, law cases, etc., will cause business students to complain about inattention to day-to-day management issues. I have dealt with this by supplementary readings of case studies. Perhaps in a new edition Regan will add such materials."},{"Title":"The D.A. calls a turn","review":"Gardner's D.A. series is much overlooked by Perry Mason fans.

If you are looking for a book to help you examine your salvation or properly be used in Gods work this book is for you."},{"Title":"Getting Evangelicals Saved","review":"Getting Evangelicals Saved explains how and why the church is lukewarm. The fire from heaven - God in us - dwells not in the hearts of many, many professing Christians. They have not been born again thus they are not \\"born of God\\" John 1. Here's something radical, page 53 \\"Please don't use John 3:16 with an unawakened sinner. Because, if you tell a sinner how to be saved, before he knows he needs to be saved, you only succeed in hardening him toward the gospel.\\"Mr. Reidhead deals thoroughly with the problem of many evangelical methods that give people the cure before they know they have a disease. They need to be awakened and this is clearly modeled by Jesus and Paul through the use of the law to show people that they have a desparate need for a Savior. (Rom. 7:7, Gal. 3:24) They're already guilty, but don't know it (yet). They must be woken up.Otherwise, they shrug and think they're a \\"good person\\" as they are comparing themselves to other people rather than holding up their lives to the standard of an infinitely Holy God and his law.But to address the subject of false converts is to rub up against the modern gospel which seeks to \\"win souls\\" through a life enhancement gospel. That if you sign up, you'll then have happiness. NO you won't. At least not the way the world defines it which is \\"to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season\\". Taking up the cross of Christ, to exchange your life for His, to walk in the way of righteousness is to partake of a grand paradox: give up your life, receive His life and get the promised persecution, trials and tribulations! Does that sound like God has a wonderful plan for our lives? In the book of Acts, Stephen didn't get that, Paul didn't hear that message before being brutally beaten. The cross is always painful and the Christian life brings true peace and joy and righteousness but the price is high - the price is everything. The Biblical way to express God's love to a sinner is to show him how great his sin is using the law and then give him the incredible grace of God in Christ.Getting Evangelicals Saved will help confused, bewildered Christians understand how the church has so strayed from the gospel according to the scriptures and teaches how to get back to applying what Jesus said and did about awakening sinners."},{"Title":"Chimney Rock: A Novel","review":"Charlie Smith is a master wordsmith. With mere words on a page, he is able to do what so many other respected, talented, and successful writers are unable to do: teleport you not just into another place filled with other people, but into an idea. Fifty percent of any Smith book is theme. Just as we spend so much of our day feeling things abstractly, taking in smells that conjure up long lost memories, and existing in what feels sometimes like a void; Charlie Smith unleashes this part of his characters. Will Blake is a Hollywood actor birthing himself out of his existential crisis and can see and finally accept, distantly, the beautiful in the terrible. The end result is sweet, dark, scary, and insightful. I found myself rereading passages just because I wanted to. I began to dream about the people and the cities and the colors of all the flowers that populate Chimney Rock. Its the kind of book that reveals the true power of a gifted writer.On the other hand, Charlie Smith is not for everyone. Inexperienced readers need not apply. If a good yarn is all your after, have a friend tell you the story. Charlie's prose is difficult. His sentences are long and crooked. They sometimes form into chains that lead to dramatically different places than they began. A man may walk into a restaraunt and say hello to a woman, but her response could occur three pages later with this type of writing. Its lyrical but indirect. Or, direct spiritually, but not narratively. Nonetheless, its the difficult roads that lead to the grandest rewards."},{"Title":"Chimney Rock: A Novel","review":"I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels."},{"Title":"The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton","review":"From the start one thing needs to be made very clear about this book. It is a nice read for a Democrat, especially a partisan Democrat like myself. My Republican friends on the other hand would, I'm afraid find very little interesting about this book. Simply put, this is a very one sided view of history. Democrats tend to be pictured in the best possible light from page one. This is not to say that Mr. Rutland has not done his homework for he has. I don't think he ever set out to write an impartial historical epic. What he seems to have intended is basicly a survey type textbook for Democrats. If that was his goal he has accomplished it. Someone looking for a quick political history of the United States told from the Democratic point of view will find it here.The simple fact is that Mr. Rutland took upon himself a rather large task in writing a history of the Democratic party. To do this task justice one would have to turn out a work that would rival in length the volumes written by Shelby Foote on the Civil War. In fact, this subject would probably require even more volumes since the subject covers over two hundred years of history. As it is the book in its 241 pages is only able to deal in the most superficial way with its subject.Still this book does a fair job of following America's oldest party from its roots as Jefferson looks to a nation of farmers to today's urban America. Along the way we see the Democrats changing to become the party of the common man and the underdog. We see the party begin to take its present form in 1896 as William Jennings Bryan and his populists take control of the convention. We see more change in 1912 with the nomination of the progressive Woodrow Wilson. Then in 1932 FDR comes along and the Democratic party is forever changed. Old Democratic issues like tariffs and free silver give way to civil rights and labor relations. The direction of the party continues on the course set by Roosevelt as Harry Truman takes over and then LBJ sets off an a path of sweeping social change that for good or bad forever changes the United States. Oddly, the book gives little credit for the present positions of the Democratic party to JFK.There are also a few places in the book where Mr. Rutland's facts are wrong. For example he states that in the election of 1896 William McKinley took T. Roosevelt with him to Washington as his Vice President when in fact T.R. wasn't on the ticket until 1900. For the most part however his facts do seem straight and he covers the subject as well as could be expected in such a short book.Overall, the book could have been more in depth and such a large subject should probably never have been undertaken. I remember in high school english I always tried to choose a very broad topic for any paper I had to write because I figured it would be easy to turn out twenty pages that way. My teacher always called me on my plan though and I had to narrow it down. Maybe Mr. Rutland needed a good high school english teacher to make him do the same here.On the other hand it is hard to study American history without a study of the Democrats. The party of Jefferson has been here through most of our history. So while this book gives one a quick look at the history of one party it also for the most part does the same for American history. Its not a waste of time to read this book by any means but it is more gravy than meat."},{"Title":"The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton","review":"Let me say right up front that I was disappointed in this book. Maybe I am too stuck in my ways, but when I pick up a history like this I was looking for an well-organized book. I want each President with his own chapter, some details that are presented for each person i.e. year of terms, Vice President etc, and then a nice review of what took place while in office, the good and the bad. The book just did not provide this; the presidents were grouped into chapters on what seemed to be on a basis as to total average chapter page length not by political or situational similarities. The basic facts that I wanted were not there for every President, and if they were there you needed to hunt for them. And if you are going to give me pictures then at least give me a picture of every President covered in the book, what we got were pictures of a few Presidents, a few campaign adds or jokes, and unbelievably to me pictures of city political bosses.The book was positive; I give the author that. When there were negative issues they were glossed over if even mentioned. I new based on the size of the book that it was not going to be an exhaustive history, but even this brief look at each President left me disappointed. Also I kept thinking that the author wanted to write a history of the Democratic party and the publisher wanted a history of the Democratic Presidents and what came out was a compromise that did not serve either cause very well. I would have much rather had a few more pages on FDR (then the 15 offered) and less about the Kansas City and Chicago political bosses and the third party candidates on some elections. I do not want to be all-negative, there were a number of interesting facts and he hit the high notes on each man. I was interested enough to finish the book. I am just going to have to keep looking for a better effort at this topic."},{"Title":"Irish Writing in the Twentieth Century: A Reader","review":"This is a desert island compendium. The price makes it a steal, too. Pierce, from his evocative introduction and his prefatory personal note on growing up in Britain \\"half-Irish,\\" takes on this monumental compiling task and gives the seasoned veteran or the total rookie not only a selection from each decade, but expands the usual limits of literature to include essays, memoirs, travel writing, and polemical pieces. While Declan Kiberd has castigated Pierce for adding such as John O'Hara and F. Scott Fitzgerald into the canon, the attention to the diaspora--from one who lives there--in my opinion strengthens the utility of this book as a guide immensely. Such keen and neglected writers on Ireland as the Australian Vincent Buckley should not be relegated to the margins for their accident of birth.What's more, there's a very detailed chronology tying together major Irish events and correlating these with works from across genres; appendices advising students about possible topics to investigate for research; a catholic bibliography; a sensible division into non-fiction and fiction in each decennial chapter. This book, while apparently aimed at the college student, should not be neglected by anyone who wants to learn more and read much more about Irish writing, as seen in enticing fragments, highlights and shadows come to light after patient recovery by Pierce; together the famous and the obscure who constructed the century for Ireland in its broadest and most appealing panorama.One omission, shamefully due to the greed of the Joyce estate; the table of contents lists, but the text does not provide, an excerpt from Ulysses due to ongoing copyright battles. As the book went to press, Cork UP could not obtain the rights from the Joyce estate's mandarins to include the passages. This should not detract from the collection's contents, as the novel is easily attainable, but it does show the pettiness and parochialism that ironically Joyce himself fulminated against still survives, decades after his death, among his self-appointed heirs who attempt still to control access to this expansive and appealing work not to be missed by any student of Irish literature. (For more on the [post-]Joyce battles, read Bruce Arnold's \\"The Scandal of Ulysses,\\" also reviewed by me.)"},{"Title":"Irish Writing in the Twentieth Century: A Reader","review":"I agree with the other reviewer: this is a tremendous anthology, unlike anything on the market. There is simply nothing this comprehensive for Irish writing in the 20th century. And the price is unbeatable.But for an instructor, it suffers from difficulty of use. There should be separate listings of works by author (and possibly genre), so that an instructor who wants to pull together some poetry or the works of a single author can do so more easily. You shouldn't have to hunt out the two Yeats poems here and the one Yeats poem there to put together an assignment on Yeats. The \\"Topics and Issues\\" section is helpful, but these others would be a big help. For specialists in Irish literature, none of this might be necessary, but for those of us who teach a very wide range of courses, the book could provide more support. Also, the large number of novel excerpts are a waste of space. Who wants to read just a few pages from a full-length novel? If space is too limited to include the full text, I'd rather they find a shorter text. If I want to read (or assign) a novel, I'll buy it separately. The sheer number of authors comes at the expense of any depth (Paul Muldoon represented by three tiny poems; Evan Boland by the same.)"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Did you know that Mary Shelley actually wrote Frankenstein based on facts - actual events? Dr. Frankenstein really did create a monster from body parts of murderers, thieves and other hooligans. He did - true story. Oh, and did you know they are both alive today? In New Orleans.Leave it up to Dean Koontz, with Kevin J. Anderson, to hatch a story where characters created years ago are alive and well and wreaking havoc to this day. Frankenstein: Prodigal Son is an entertaining look at how these two well-known characters would behave in the modern world. The monster (Deuclian) has learned to control the violence within him. The doctor (Victor Helios) has learned that advances in science and technology will allow him to create a Utopian society in which he will be God.There are some grisly murders, possible serial killers, bantering detectives (think a male/female Lethal Weapon with some sexual tension), Stepford-like creations with super-human strength and speed and an autistic boy whose smile may very well cause his demise. The book is a fast-paced read with short chapters (not a very Koontz thing) that jump from one set of characters to another in a coherent fashion.This said, not my favorite Dean Koontz. The idea is great and the basic elements were there but parts of the story and characters were very cliche. I realize the banter between the detectives was an effort at character development but it was over the top and distracting at times. I truly enjoyed the sections concerning Dr. Frankenstein/Helios and his attempts to create a super race. His relationship with his \\"wife\\" and descriptions of his household were very enjoyable and did create a diabolical character that I had no problem disliking and fearing.I would recommend this book to a Koontz fan or anyone who likes a good, easy monster story. I will be reading the next two books in the trilogy since there was nothing concluded in Prodigal Son and I am interested enough to want to see what happens.Other Koontz and Frankenstein info:Frankenstein: Prodigal Son actually started as a screenplay written by Mr. Koontz for the USA cable network. When the television show strayed so drastically from his vision, Mr. Koontz pulled-out of the project and decided to write his story as a novel. The original Frankenstein actually gave the author nightmares into his thirties. He describes this in his Frankenstein website:From the time I saw the best of the Frankenstein films on TV when I was eleven-the original featuring Karloff's remarkable performance, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein-I relished them even though they gave me the worst nightmares of my life. In fact, I continued to have Frankenstein-themed nightmares into my thirties, a few times a year crying out in my sleep and waking in a sweat. Interestingly, when the Frankenstein dreams stopped, I ceased having nightmares of any kind; and for many years, my sleep has been undisturbed."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"My sister has impatiently waited to start reading this series again. :) She received her book and was very happy with it."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz books never leave you bored.

I love it. Quick, easy reading.I must admit that when I was reading the back cover at the store I thought it was going to be another serial killer book, set in New Orleans, with probably some supernatural connection, given the author. Boy was I ever wrong and boy was I pleasantly surprised. A little ways into the story I was like, 'What!???!! Dr. Frankenstein and the monster STILL ALIVE!?!?\\" What a cool concept! The story rolls along and keeps me wanting to read just one-more-chapter before putting it down. I love the characters - especially the sarcastic combativness between the two main detectives.I wish I could see this as a movie, as it was intended. It plays like a movie in my mind as I'm reading.If you like a break from reality, like I do from time to time, then this book will give it to you! Can't wait to start Book 2."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Just as we don't watch films like \\"Spider-Man\\" and television shows like \\"Heroes\\" for their brilliant acting and creative cinematography, we don't read Dean Koontz novels for their literary value. How else could you explain the ability to read a novel that nears 500 pages in a matter of two days? That being said, we still enjoy those types of films and shows for the value they do offer: they help us escape our mundane lives through fantastic storytelling and fast-paced action. This is what you should expect from Prodigal Son, the first book in the straight-to-paperback Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series.The story takes place two hundred years after the end of Mary Shelley's classic novel, in modern-era New Orleans where Frankenstein's monster, having renamed his self Deucalion, is working closely with two homicide detectives on the trail of the copycat serial killers. One killer, having previously been hell-bent on ridding the human race of ugly people, has switched motives to collecting the most beautiful female body parts he can find. The other, a genetically engineered evolutionary advancement created by Victor Helios (aka Frankenstein) is gutting male victims in attempt of discovering the part of the human race that he lacks: the source of happiness.Koontz's signature short chapters are action-packed and move the story along quickly. As is the case with his other novels, the supernatural and/or abominable nature of science fiction plays an important role in the story's development. Those facets always seem to give Koontz an easy escape from tricky plot developments. Nevertheless, the novel is a valid contribution for its unique monsters and the creative villainy of Victor Helios.If you're in the mood for \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" or \\"The Shawshank Redeption,\\" read something else. If you're craving a mindless horror flick, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein: Prodigal Son (Book One) is worth two or three days of your reading list's time."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz's very readable and well paced Christian-Horror series continues with many interesting (and crazy) characters. For those new to Christian novels, or the series in general, Koontz has take Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein and his monster and placed them in today's world of skyscrapers. Common to the series is themes of horror, suspense, and the theme of science and psychology as the enemy of mankind."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz explains in the beginning of this book, that at first this idea, the reimagining of Frankenstein was to become a TV miniseries but fell through, so him and Kevin Anderson went ahead and made it a book series. I am glad they did.It isn't Koontz or Anderson's best work, but it's a good read never-the-less. An interesting twist on the legend of Victor Frankenstein and his monstrous creation. What if Victor F kept creating after his first scrap job? His practice piece turned on him and it wasn't a perfect specimen by any means, so why not just keep trying? And while he is at it, modify his own body to become pretty much immortal, to live forever, omnipotent to his creations like a God. The monster, who now calls himself Deucalion, is still living in a monastery, contemplating life and living in some sort of temporary peace. That all ends with an article sent to him by an old friend and he leaves the monastery for New Orleans which is now the home of Victor Helios, formerly known as Heir Frankenstein.A rash of hideous murders has taken place in New Orleans, body parts taken from them. The police are calling him \\"the surgeon\\" because all the cuts are precise and professional. There is also another set of bodies, with parts missing, but these are clumsily torn apart and seem desperate, not really \\"the surgeons\\" MO, but the police don't rule them out as related. Two cops Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison are assigned to The Surgeon and soon discover that they aren't dealing with a normal serial killer, and the victims aren't very normal either.I really liked this book, I wanted more of Deucalion but I know as the series goes on he will play a bigger role hopefully, he is quite the misunderstood monster. The book flows nicely, its easy to follow, its not confusing and it doesnt lull in any part, Koontz isnt a writer of gore and splatter but he gives us plenty to cringe at in this novels pages. He also brings in alot of thought on creationism, religion, eugenics, and \\"human\\" nature. I am looking forward to reading the rest."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I re-read the original \\"Frankenstein\\" before starting this one. I think Koontz, et al., did a great job of updating and continuing the story. I look forward to Vol. 2 and anticipate Vol. 3 which is coming this summer (2009). Vol. 1 was past-faced with characters I really enjoyed."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I read Frankenstein about twenty years ago. I always thought it was a stand alone novel. The idea of a sequel never really crossed my mind. Koontz and Anderson bring back the magic of that incredible book while also adding a new ideas to the story that makes it hard to resist and impossible to put down.This book is incredible. It takes place in present time so you get to see what your friends from original Frankenstein are doing over 200 years later. The story centers around two detectives that are investigating a series of murder cases were body parts are being taken from the victims. They soon realize that one of the victims is not human. The other main stories centers around two men one named Victor Helious who is living in New Orleans. What kind I say? He is kind of a scientist. The other story is about a man... a rather large man who is relocating back to New Orleans once he finds out that Victor Helious is still alive.Dean Koontz and Kevin J Anderson tell a great story that not only continues the classic story but also introduces the content to a new generation. There is also has a mystery aspect to it that could almost stand alone even without the Frankenstein element.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This was a fast paced read for me (and not many are these days). Koontz takes the two pivotal characters from Shelly's \\"Frankenstein\\" and brings them forward to modern times. Dr. Frankenstein is still up to his unethical tricks and has managed to prolong his own life through various methods (and oodles of $) while his first creation patch-worked from various body parts \\"Deucalion\\" has also survived. Deucalion has spent many years searching for purpose and has quietly been living among monks to find peace. He is brought out of his world of tranquility when he learns that Dr. Frankenstein is still creating monsters (though this time via modern methods). One of Dr. F's creations has gone renegade and become a serial killer (and collector of various body parts). Deucalion, because he knows Dr. F's motives so well, joins forces with the police to help find the killer. This book held my attention from beginning to end with an interesting story as well as interesting characters. It's humorous and horrifying and a very good read."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I had heard about Dean Koontz's Frankenstein long before I read it. I have ready many Koontz books and sometimes felt the endings of the books lacked in some way. As I was browsing through an airport bookstore, I saw this book and decided to pick it up. Boy, am I glad I did! This is one of the better books I have read in a long time.The writing style and language grab you from the very beginning and don't let go until the last page. The characters are all very well developed and Koontz actually has you caring for them when you are only a few pages into the book.The thing I really like about this book is that it isn't just the normal story of good vs. evil. The \\"good guys\\" have some bad in them that they are trying to overcome and many of the \\"bad guys\\" have some good in them also.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. As everyone else is counting down the days to the new Harry Potter book, I'll be doing a similar count for the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean kootz's new thriller tells what really happened to Frankensteins monster. its a fast passed thrill ride that you won't be able to put down. Mary Shelly meets Michael Connely. I can't wait for the second book in the series."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"The Monster? No, the book! Dean Koontz has teamed up with Kevin Anderson (of Star Wars fiction fame) to produce one of the poorest written books I may have ever had the displeasure to come across. The story is actually not half bad. The basic idea was fairly thought provoking and honestly, the ONLY reason I read the book was because I am currently working on a Frankenstein novel myself and wanted to see what Koontz was doing with the character and story. Quite a bit, I can tell you, and again, the *story* is really pretty good.The writing, however...It reads like two people wrote this sitting in the same chair, fighting over the keyboard. I've never seen more awkward use of tags in dialog. The main police detective characters are absolutely horrible, but ironically, very funny. I was surprised at the amount of humor in \\"Prodigal Son\\" and the Frankenstein monster looks to be a compelling character with numerous layers of depth. I want to know more about him (and the lightening's effect on him when he was created.)Dr. Victor Helios (Victor Frankenstein--he takes on the name of Helios for several reasons) is extremely uninteresting and stereotyped like the blood-n-guts, shoot-first cops I mentioned and I found New Orleans to be a poor setting. Reminds me too much of Rice's vampire town. He should have set the book in Europe, IMHO, but who am I?Koontz (as I've said in other reviews) is hit and miss with me. Some of his stuff (like \\"Odd Thomas\\") is both brilliant AND entertaining. Not this. I haven't read all of Koontz's work yet, but so far this is (mechanically) his worst, in my opinion. I remember a brief note Koontz posted on his web site saying that he was disappointed in the Frankenstein book(s) himself and would finish the series solo. He certainly can't do worse and I suspect the collaboration may be at fault. I've never read Anderson's books, but I'm pretty familiar with Koontz and it just didn't jive with what I had read before. I suspect Book 3 will be very different from Books 1 (\\"Prodigal Son\\") and 2 (\\"City of Night\\"). Let's hope so.\\"Odd Thomas\\", however...you really should read \\"Odd Thomas\\" if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I am a big fan of classic horror films...although not necessarily of the source material the films were based on. Add to that I've only read a few Koontz books in my lifetime and I went into this book with a lot of skepticism. In this re-imagining of the Mary Shelly works, the Frankenstein Monster, called Deucalion, has survived and is leading a quiet life in a Tibetan Monsastery. He's secreted away from the rest of the world, safe and sound. He then learns, however, that his creater Victor Frankenstein is alive and well, and living in New Orleans, mad as ever.Frankenstein is now a rich Tycoon, and is up to his old tricks of creating life, and hell-bent on replacing mankind with his laboratory spawned creations. Unlike the Lighting created patchwork of corpses, these new creatures have been created with the latest technology and been essentially grown in the lab, and designed to be perfect. When one of these \\"perfect\\" creations escapes and becomes a serial killer, Deucalion will actually join forces with a couple of cops to hunt down the creature and Frankenstein.This is an interesting and intriguing take on the Frankenstein mythology. It's not Karloff and James Whale to be sure. The original monster owes much more to the original Shelly story. This monster is intelligent and thoughful and it is his creator who is the true monster. The characterizations of the monster and Freankenstein are well done and interesting.

It is a compulsive read, and it tells the truth within the lie of fiction.It is not for the faint of heart.

Among them include:+ A godless, Igor-like priest (without the deformity)+ An autistic soul looking for happiness; called Randal Six+ A severed head (named Karloff) and an Adams Family-like disembodied hand+ A homicidal police detective, how ironic+ Several Stepford Wife-like brides called Erika who are numbered like movie sequels+ And a monstrous, troll-like creature who emerges from Jonathan Harker's torso in a manner reminiscent of the movie Alien.

It is NOT a stand alone book! It neither has a suitable closure ending for a book in a three book series nor makes any other sort of case for separating this story into three books. The spacing is huge, the chapters are atypically short for even Dean Koontz, and it easily could have only required 100 pages in a very readable format.From all evidence that I see, this is a ploy to gain the revenue of three books from a one-book story! Either a cheap move by Koontz or his publisher.As for the story it is rather Koontzian but, at least so far, it lacks the creativity that Dean's other books bring to the market.If you insist on reading this series, I would start with the last book and save significant money in the process.

Second, I have read almost all of his books. However, this is not up to his standards, and I wonder if the co-author (Kevin J. Anderson) did most of the writing. It lacks everything most Koontz novels have: humor, love, super-intelligent animals, a touch of the supernatural, a sense of awe and wonder, optimism, and a well-developed protagonist you can care about and identify with. And while a few of Koontz's books have had sequels, his books have never left you hanging like this one, with so much unsettled, so much unresolved. The romance is just hinted at between the two cops, and Deucalion, while interesting, is too super-human and not well enough developed to identify with and care about. And finally, \\"In a mansion as large as this, a severed hand had to do alot of crawling to get where it wanted to go,\\" has to be one of the silliest lines in the history of literature. i can't even tell whether this was meant as humor or to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"As a writer, Dean Koontz is a favorite of mine because of hs tremendous imagination and his ability to place a reader into a strange and distant world without making them roll their eyes. It's quite an impressive feat.That being said, I feel that Frankenstein is a \\"take it or leave it\\" as far as Koontz books go. My wife and I were discussing the contrasts between his better and lesser novels, and we decided that no matter what the book, his writing is great. It is his ability to bring magic into worlds that decides the fate of his books. I was disappointed with Frankenstein because there was no magic.I enjoyed the Monster's character. I wanted more. The others were so-so and I really felt like the book didn't take us very far.But Koontz has an amazing imagination. This may not be his best work, but deserves nothing less than 4 stars because even when he's not at his best, he is a champion wordsmith. I'd say get this book used if you must buy it. If you're not an avid Koontz reader,d skip it entirely and move to something tried and true. It's just an opinion, of course, but but it's one I feel confident in.Despite all this I can still say THANK GOD KOONTZ HASN'T LOST HIS TOUCH. My favorite aspect of this book was very CS Lewis-like. He really helped show that we are created human--flaws and all--for a purpose. If you think you can make \\"improvemnets\\" on mankind, you will be much mistaken and find that choice and faith and supersticion are what make us a seccessful creation. Love and hate and disaster and intrigue are all a part of happiness. The way Koontz writes it, you'll have to read that between the lines, but it's not difficult. He's a master at what he does."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I've read several versions of Mary Shelly's classic tale, but leave it to Dean Koontz to put his own spin on the book.

Koontz, as usual, makes you feel like you're a character written into the book. Even though he doesn't write in the first person, you almost feel like he has, with his writing style. Koontz has the amazing ability to take 4 mini-stories, include them in the greater story. You'll never get lost though.

The plot is very cool and revolves around a number of very interesting characters. But the problem is there are like 92 chapters in this book. That makes each chapter about six pages long. In six pages you can't really be absorbed into the story. Just when something begins to happen that is exciting...BAM you're chapter is over and you are reading about another character. Sometiems chapters even split a single scene into two parts.Bottom line is that the book is good...but I just couldn't really get into it. (But I will be reading book 2, hopefully it will flow a bit better than this one)"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"this book is very good as I have come to expect of Dean KoontzI've been reading his books as long as he has been writing them and am never disappointedI wish the 3rd book was coming sooner but i'll take it when I can get it"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz's \\"Frankenstein\\" is based on a 60 minute TV pilot that Koontz wrote that was picked up by USA network. When USA asked him to write a two hour pilot and possibly follow it with a series he obliged. However, USA then took the script rewrote it, changing all most all of it, Koontz withdrew from the project. Now he has decided to put it in book form and while it entertaining and funny there are a few problems with it. Firstly, unlike Koontz's other books the characters aren't developed as fully as they could be. Secondly, it ends a bit abruptly, but there's a second book coming so... But the book is pretty good and is one of the better Frankenstein remakes to come out in recent years.The chapters introduce us to a number of characters; first we have Carson O'Connor.Carson is a girl, in case the name confused you. She's a homicide detective, with an autistic brother who is currently looking for a serial killer who calls himself The Surgeon.The Surgeon has been tracking down women and taking the body parts that appeal to him in the hopes of compiling the perfect woman. He doesn't consider what he's going to do when he has all the parts though. Carson's partner Michael Maddison has crush on her, although due to their partnership is reluctant to admit it. Michael has the best dialogue in the book, every time he speaks it's a wisecrack and some of it is laugh-out-loud funny.Then we're introduced to Victor Helios, a biotech tycoon who is actually Victor Frankenstein, over two hundred years old. We also have Decaulion, the original Frankenstein. A deformed, tattooed man hunting Victor to finally kill his master. And Randal Six, an autistic creation of Victor who longs for happiness and sees the chance to find it in Carson's brother Arnie. Now that I've established that, Victor is creating a race of \\"Frankensteins\\" he calls the New Race which he will eventually use to destroy us; the Old Race. Koontz has came up with a brilliant idea and the only problem with the book is the character development. Not that the characters aren't well developed, they're just not well developed for a Koontz novel.

Everyone seems to have given their own varied basic story line, so that's not what I'm going to do.The tone of this book is grim. It's not happy, not by a longshot, but the language is thoughtful and understanding, which makes hating characters all the more difficult.The characters are solid and well-rounded. There were a few cracks in the seams that I think could've been mended by a little more editing, but all in all I thought the characters were realistic to the point where I was comparing them with myself.The book is the first in a series, and it hangs at the end, like it's supposed to.

The authors are clearly \\"thriller\\" writers, as their grasp of the essentials of science and horror fiction are much lacking. Even their descriptive prose is bland, matter-of-fact, and uninspired, lacking the vocabulary and wit of far better writers of the genre such as H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Brian Lumley. They should stick to ordinary \\"suspense,\\" because that's what this novel is full of... lots of prosaic meanderings while you're waiting for something to happen, and very little ever does, considering its 469 pages and 97 (!) chapters. Lots of characterization, to the point of sheer boredom, and very little action. This story could have been told with less than half the words.--There is a typical buddy-cop team, one of them a stereotypically overly-macho female, who, not surprisingly, has a man's first name--Carson. In her very first scene she uses physical force against and displays her gun to, a gangbanger and then never arrests him or even reports the incident, something surely to get you fired in the real world. Ditto for a later accidental discharge of her handgun, which she likewise never reports; she shows up for work suffering from lack of sleep and has to go home early because of it; she embodies the clich&eacute; of never letting her partner drive (he's the predictable comedy-relief, whom she consistently out-machos); she is involved in a gunfight and has only loaded the shotgun with three shells. In the real world, real cops(I was one) would term her a \\"wannabe.\\" The authors clearly understand little about real police officers as evidenced by the continual use of over-done movie cop clich&eacute;s. Clich&eacute;s which I found as far-fetched as the basic premise.--I'm a big Frankenstein fan, which is about the only reason I bothered pursuing this book to the end. The two buddy-cops are hopelessly clich&eacute;d. By far the most interesting character in the book is Frankenstein's original creation, now dubbed Deacalion, who gets far too little exposure and only shows up as a plot device. The authors provide very little coverage of the more fantastic (i.e. interesting) parts of the tale and concentrate on the characterization and suspense (i.e. boring) narratives. There are an over-abundance (typical in today's books) of pop-culture references. At least 3 to Star Trek alone. It reminded me of a screenplay, with a new chapter every time the scene changes. Do yourself a favor and wait for the movie. Hollywood will surely rave over it."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"After reading \\"the Taken\\", I was a bit skeptical to buy another Koontz novel - that book was a throw away story. But after reading Frankenstein I am now leaning towards being in the Dean Koontz camp. Why leaning? Only because one book does not make a trend. He's batting 1 for 2 right now so I'll just wait & see.This book is a real page turner. Not too scarey, but some good suspense and a great twist on a classic tale. It is a very believeable take on \\"what would happen if Dr Frankenstein & his monster never died and made it to the 21st century?\\".There are more monsters in this book than you can keep track of, but each one has a story and in the end all the story lines meet up."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I admit, the idea is very origonal, yet Dean Koontz (who I'm shocked had anything to do with this book) could have made this book so much better. I've read many of his novels and this is by far the worst.The more I read the more outlandish the story got, and I found myself laughing at the end when Johnathon was running from the cops with a baby monster creature hanging half attached to the inside of his belly, as he was giving birth to it.I did however think the storyline of the retarded boy who could only move through a series of imaginary crossword boxes was cool, but I will probably not be reading the next one. I dont even think he's going to finish the series anyway. It was scheduled to come out like 2 years ago.Dean Koontz has always been one of my favorite authors. I just hope he's not losing his luster for writing."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Leave it to Koontz to come up with a way to reenergize the Frankenstein story."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Frankenstein movies and books have been out and around since the original novel was written by Mary Shelly. While I'm not a hardcore fan of Frankenstein I have to admit the idea of where a new storyline with it and its characters would go. Although, I was worried when I picked this book up from this book at a library book sale for 25 cents.This book is very good because it never focus's on one character and all of the on going plots are very interesting. Although, their are a lot of them so sometimes I felt confused on what was going on.Also, at times the book seemed pretty long (despite it only being around 470 pages) but overall it was a good book. I would recommend it, even if its not the kind of book that's for everyone."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I have loved to read Dean Koontz books for the past ten years. I took a break from his books, however, after it seemed like he was churning out the same story over and over with different characters or rushing books to print.Prodigal Son has brought me back to Mr. Koontz's books. The first 40 pages or so were hard for me to get into. In developing Carson, his lead detective, I felt he was putting her into contrived, completely unrealistic situations with crazy dialogue. Once I got through the first 40, the book really picked up and I had trouble putting it down. It's a fresh new twist on an old concept, and I think Koontz did a great job.The book follows Carson and her partner, Michael, as they track down a serial killer in New Orleans. After several twists and turns, Carson meets a man who claims to have been pieced together from the body parts of murderers, brought to life with a strike of lightning, by Victor Helios, AKA Victor Frankenstein. Victor has been quite busy populating New Orleans with his New Race, people he has created to eventually take over the world. The New Race is breaking down, however, becoming attacking and dissecting members of the Old Race in their attempt to find their own humanity.Great characters, interesting plot and a quick read - I can't wait to get the second book in the series!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"After taking a long break from Dean Koontz, I had to get these as soon as I had the chance. I was at a point where I was getting tired of the same kinda story set in good old Cali. But, I couldn't let his view on a great classic story just go by. Now I am fully back into and his writing again and can't wait for book four to hit the streets. Book one started out a little slow in my opinion but picked up by page 100 and hasen't stopped rolling since. Koontz ability to take you on that lovely roller coaster ride is in full force with a lot of surprise turns everywhere. If you are just thinking of picking up this series and have like Koontz in the past I highly recommend them and try not to read any spoilers, it can ruin a lot of surprises."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Most of us know the story of Mary Shelly's monster from the 1800's. What if the story didn't end there?That's the basis for this series of novels from Dean Koontz.Carson O'Connor and Micheal Maddison are homicide detectives investigating a series of murders in New Orleans. Along the way they discover that the classic story of Frankenstein and his monster lab may not be just fiction.My husband originally borrowed an audio copy of this book from the local library. I didn't get to finish listening to it before it was returned. So, a few months later, I decided to check out the unabridged book.The story jumps around a bit. Each chapter is written as a vignette of the characters involved: one chapter follows the detectives, the next follows Victor \\"Frankenstein\\" Helios, the next follows the murder victims, then another chapter with the detectives again. The pro for this style of writing is that the chapters read quickly, with only the minimum number of adjectives needed to express the plot. The con for this style is that some readers may have trouble tying one chapter's action into another."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Bought this book as someone loaned me the next two in the series. I read them all within 2 weeks because I needed to see what was coming next, and it was hard to put them down. I hope to hear more about Deucalion's \\"adventures\\"."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Prodigal son is Dean Koontz's take on Victor Frankenstein. 200 years later He is still alive but living under an alias and living in the city of New Orleans. He is still practicing his art of creating humans or monsters, and they are called the \\"New Race\\". As we enter the story he is creating a army of the new race to one day take over the old race (humans), but his creations are starting to have minds of their own, questioning existence, god, and trying to find happiness. This is all a bad sign as things are getting a little chaotic.We follow the stories of a few new race monsters, one is Deucalion, the original monster that Frankenstein created and is the basis for the original book. Another is a murderer trying to find something inside others, one is the sexual plaything of Victor Frankenstein, and one is an autistic monster trying to find happiness. Pulled into this whole mess is two New Orleans detectives: Carson and Michael, who slowly come to grips with the astonishing fact that this is all real.The voice acting was good, the abridgment was not. Although we get 5 discs, which is why I still read it, as I expect maybe one, at most 2 discs were cut in the abridgment, and I can live with that. I still think I got the gist of the whole story, and see no reason to not recommend it. I liked the story and the audio production."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, and although this is not my favorite book, it was definitely a page turner.

I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"If you are looking for a re-imagining or modern take on Mary Shelley's tale, this isn't the novel for you. Dean Koontz takes the classic characters and plops them into a modern sci-fi/crime caper. Don't expect a lurching Karloff like monster in this tale, and don't hold your breath waiting for a hunchbacked assistant to make an appearence either.Actually, if you picture \\"the monster\\" in a \\"Batman\\"-like role, you are closer to what Koontz has imagined. The \\"monster\\" who calls himself Deucalion (while slightly better than \\"monster\\"...it still wouldn't be my first choice in name selection) plays basically an extended cameo in this opening novel of the Koontz trilogy. Part Zen monk and part caped crusader when Deucalion makes an appearance it's usually brief...and usually accompanied by rain while holding pennies.The meat of this first novel is a serial killer working in New Orleans, snatching body parts from young women, and internal orgrans from various men. The main characters are two young homicide detectives on the hunt for the madman known as The Surgeon.The novel does a really good job of laying out the framework for the rest of the series. I'm just hoping that the \\"monster\\" plays a more pivotal role in the next two entries. Victor Helios plays a fantastic villain, and yes...there are some great laboratory scenes featured in the novel. Many of the electrical devices seen in the Universal films have been replaced with oozing liquid tanks and hoses...but it's still crazy scientist in the laboratory stuff that sci-fi fans should eat up.Now that all 3 books have been published, give this one a shot. It's inventive and fun and well worth investing a bit of your time in."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"In the Frankenstein trilogy, bestselling author Dean Koontz goes on a tangent from his usual novels with this short series taking on arguably one of the two most famous horror novels of all time (the other being Dracula, of course), but putting a whole new spin on it that will leave readers reaching for the sequel.In a world much like our own just about everyone knows about Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. What everyone doesn't know is that it was based on a legend about a scientist known as Dr. Frankenstein. Only he somehow managed to make himself immortal and is now alive and well in the twentieth century, living in the United States. And over the last century he has been busy. His new and improved \\"creatures\\" now walk the streets as ordinary looking humans with extraordinary powers. Only some of them are starting to \\"malfunction,\\" killing innocent human beings in the process. Victor Helios, as the doctor is now known, doesn't care, continuing to create, with the goal of taking over the world with a perfect race.Then there is Deucalion, Frankenstein's original monster, who is now forced to come to the Untied States to face the growing evil and put a stop to it. Meanwhile detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison get to deal with all the mangled and destroyed bodies that keep showing up, trying to put the pieces together and figure out what is really going on.Prodigal Son is a strong start to the trilogy that reveals Koontz still has some great stories to tell. With an abrupt end, readers will be grabbing for book two, City of Night, and book three, Dead and Alive, which is now available.[...]."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"With over 40 novels to his credit, many of them bestsellers, there is little disputing that Dean Koontz is one of the world's most successful novelists. However Koontz's career has had its ups and downs. I like to look at his career as a 4-phase wave. The first phase was when Dean was still refining his chops as a novelist with early thrillers such as \\"Night Chills\\", \\"The Vision\\" and \\"Funhouse\\". These novels were highly entertaining, albeit somewhat unsophisticated works of suspense. Phase 2 of his career, which occurred during the 1980's, is the best, with an endless stream of classics, most notably \\"Phantoms\\", \\"Watchers\\", \\"Strangers\\" \\"Midnight\\" and\\"Lightning\\". Koontz stayed in top form for nearly a decade and a half before hitting a nose-dive in the later half of the 90's with what I like to consider phase 3 of his career, where his writing started to get soft, melancholic and where Dean was constantly trying to prove to people that \\"I'm not a horror writer\\". Novels released during this period such as \\"From the corner of his eye\\", \\"One door away from heaven\\", and \\"The Face\\" while still managing to maintain commercial success were among the worst of his career. Phase 4 is what I like to refer to as the resuscitation of Dean's career, which started with the excellent \\"Odd Thomas\\" in 2003, \\"Velocity\\", the post-apocalyptic \\"The Taking\\" and now his 3-volume reworking of Frankenstein. Yep, Koontz is back at the top of his game and as a lifelong fan of his works I couldn't be any happier.Koontz's new saga takes place in the city of New Orleans where unbeknownst to the general populace and its authority figures Victor \\"Frankenstein\\" Helios has been busy designing and developing a \\"New Race\\", a more sophisticated kind that he wants to populate the world with. Helios is certifiably mad of course, and his experiment begins to take an unexpected turn when some of his subjects start to malfunction and rebel against their commands by brutally murdering civilians around the city. Investigating the case are detectives Carson O'Connor and her cynical partner Michael. Once it becomes apparent that the murders are not the mere work of a serial killer but that there are more mysterious forces behind them, they enlist the help of Deucalion, Victor Helios' first creation who has now rebelled against his maker and his kind.Apparently this novel is co-written by Kevin J. Anderson although it's unclear to me what part he had in writing the novel since this story has Koontz's signature stamp and style all over it. He is finally returning to the type of thriller that elevated his career to new heights, which is the technology run amok theme with a vicious god-complex serial killer and other horrific elements thrown into the mix. The city of New Orleans, with its traditions of voodoo and the macabre, provides the perfect backdrop for what Koontz sets out to achieve.I found it to be a refreshing idea that this time around it's police detectives, usually portrayed as the most cynical of species in popular fiction, that would believe in a supernatural entity. The female detective is the believer, the male one is the skeptic, kind of like a reversed Mulder & Scully. Once the two finally get over their cynicism, start to believe and go after Helios and his ghouls is when the book gets really interesting.I must admit to agreeing with the several reviewers who have noted that this feels incomplete and ends abruptly and that's why I am awarding this a 4-*star review. When all is said and done, this series as a whole might merit 5 stars but as a stand-alone novel I can only give this one a 4. It takes too much timesetting up its premise and when it finally picks up steam, the novel ends.Still, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is shaping up to be an excellent series. This doesn't feel like a Mary Shelley rehash at all. I'm familiar with her tale yet was consistently surprised with the unexpected turns and directions Koontz went with this story. This definitely feels more like classic Koontz then what Shelley wrote. And with its short chapters (97 in all) it's great reading for commuters and/or those who don't usually have enough time to read fiction."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series supposedly updates Mary Shelley's story for the twenty-first century. However, Koontz's version contains so many unbelievable factors that it was impossible to cast aside skepticism and just go with the story. Koontz's Frankenstein not only created a patch quilt, long-lived monster two centuries ago (somehow overcoming tissue decomposition, infections, organ and tissue rejections, brain death, and severed cranial nerves and spinal cord), he also did the following: prevented aging; perfected human cloning; built artificial wombs that promote rapid growth from fetus to adult; redesigned humans with replicate hearts and livers, superhuman strength, superhuman speed, and telekinetic control of severed body parts; invented an electronic interface to the human brain allowing decades of knowledge to be instilled in only four months; and inserted programmed nanomolecules into the brains of his creations that prevent them from harming him. Koontz's Frankenstein must have an IQ of 400. I might have been able to get past Frankenstein's incredibility if the story were more interesting. Unfortunately, most of the novel is a cliched police procedural about tracking down a serial killer and a copycat killer.It's hard to believe that \\"Prodigal Son\\" was by the same author who wrote \\"Intensity,\\" a great suspense novel and movie."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I have not read Dean Koontz work in sometime...at least 15 years...and man have I been missing out....this is the first book in the Frankenstein series and this was really decent....twisted fun!!!

I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt.

This is a fun, intriguing look at the evil Doc Frankenstein, who was certainly a monster before chopping his own body up to become yet more so.

This is set in today's time period as if the Frankenstein monster still lived and how he would adapt to modern society.

It sounded interesting, but I wasn't sure I wanted to read it. Every time i went to the store to look at books I was drawn to the book so I decided to try it. I loved the book and I had trouble putting it down. When I was done with this book I immediately bought the next book."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Of all the \\"remakes\\" of the classic Frankenstein, Dean Koontz's version of the classic with it's modern twist is far the best in my opinion. If you read the \\"first\\" on the first page, Koontz explains that his version almost became a television series with Martin Scorsese as executive producer. Dean Koontz and Martin later then withdrew their intrest because USA Network and it's producer wanted to make major changes in the script. It's too bad that it never happened, because I think it would've been the best version of the classic!After reading Koontz's Frankenstein, I can only suspect that the script needed to be changed for ethical and moral reasons. The only true characters from the original is \\"Deucalion\\" and \\"Victor Helios\\". I love the way Koontz has revived these characters with such extreme \\"sickness\\" and humanity. I cannot explain the story that evolves around these characters other than to say-Go and read Dean Koontz's Frankenstein!I also wished that I had taken my time with this book, because now I have to wait for book 2 to come out!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Reading this book was a nice relief from several recent books by DK that I havn't enjoyed nearly as much as his earlier worked. This book has adventure, action, both realism and surrealism (unlike Life Expectancy, which is totally surreal)We are back to multiple characters and story lines that come together and interact with each other. There are monsters, villains, and idealistically good cops.The story is fast paced and entertaining. This is the Koontz I enjoy and can't put down. I can't wait to read the second book. Bring it on!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I struggled with how to review this book. As usual I picked up this book, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein book 1, when I was traveling somewhere to read and take my mind off the flight. It worked and the book was good. But really, could they not have made the print smaller and made two books just one book? The book did not have the bite of other Koontz novels, but he did share the writing. It is a bit far fetched, but it is a good update on the classic work Frankenstein. Overall - B JVD"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This is a wonderful twist on the classic. The characters are very well rounded and I was grabbed from the beginning. I now and then ponder how the biologically impossible events in the book could actually be brewing in someones own lab at this very moment. Mr. Koontz takes today's traditional underdog and makes him not someone to pity but someone to perhaps admire. My only negative on the book is that I am hooked and will make sure I quickly purchase the next in the series.If you like seeing the dark side of life let in a little light, you will undoubtedly become a Koontz addict as have I. Don't plan on doing anything else until you finish this one.I also highly recommend THE FACE. Another dark side trying to usurp the light. Excellent, excellent, excellent books."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I have to admitt that I am not as big a book reader as I used to be. However, when I saw this book in the store I couldn't resist.The idea of making a remake of the classic book was exciting and possibly to like the original. Let me tell you upfront that this book was GREAT!!!! It is the fastest I've ever read a book (4 days); I could not put it down. This book is very direct in the plot, and easy to follow the chapter changes. Koontz writes the characters in a way that you can truely understand exactly what they're feeling, and you can sympathize with even the dubious villians. I hope you take the time to read this book, IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!!!PS- The next part to this book is set to be released in July 2005 :)"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I'm pleasantly suprised. I have read K.Anderson 'novelizations',and been a long time DK fan, and so far I am really enjoyingthe series. I wont re-iterate the Editorial Write-Up. You canalso go to DK's web page and get a synopsis of all the maincharacters. Looking forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I'll say up front that I am not a Dean Koontz fan. I lovedWatchersbut the next couple of Koontz books left me cold and so I stopped reading him after that. I say this not to bash him as an author, but to establish that my praise for this book is based on its own merits and not any admiration for the author in general.When I saw that this book was based on the Frankenstein mythos, it grabbed my attention and I decided to take a chance on Prodigal Son. While the book starts off a touch slow as it introduces a number of characters and subplots, it quickly builds tension and speed. Detective Carson O'Conner is the central character but Victor Frankenstein and his perspective are also prevalent throughout the story. There are two serial killers at work and for very different reasons both the police and Victor want to find one of the murderers. I don't want to spoil the plot so I'll stay away from the details but the characters are very well handled and I found it to be more and more of a page turner as I went along. There are also some enjoyable scenes featuring Victor's creations as they use their superhuman strength and speed if you enjoy a good monster fest.I only had a couple of quibbles with this book. First, it is only the first of a planned series of three so it doesn't have a true ending. Many of the threads are tied up but there is a real cliffhanger on the last page. I would prefer that the story be more self-contained even if there is a larger tale to continue in later novels. Second, one of the serial killers takes up a large part of the first half of the book and then his part of the story comes to a screeching halt with no real payoff. While his presence makes a somewhat interesting contrast and parallel to Victor, it's hard to say that the character really needed half the space he was given, so it almost seems like filler in hindsight. Still, his story was fairly interesting so it's far from devastating to the book.Taken as a whole, I definitely enjoyed Prodigal Son. I have not yet decided if I'll buy the next two chapters (only the second book is even available as I write this) but this was a good read and may even convince me to try another Koontz book at some point."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Keeping my review simple.

I love Dean Koontz books, without exception, so it's no wonder I loved this one, too!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I hate reviews that tell me too much about a book.What I loved about Prodigal Son was the pacing, the gritty feel of the darker parts of New Orleans (my personal favorite city), and complex characters who were interwoven in this thriller. I was also thrilled to know that Kevin J. Anderson was a co-author on this adventure. Kevin's novelizations for SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW and THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN capture the feel of the movie as well as allow a reader to fill in with their own imagination. How I wish that FRANKENSTEIN had been made for TV or Film...I'd be in line at least twice to see it because of the craftmanship of Anderson & Koontz on paper only makes my want to see a filmed interpretation that much more."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Forget what you've heard about. Victor Frankenstein and his creation did not die--they are still alive, and in New Orleans. Driven by power, Victor has created a race--a New Race--of \\"men\\" who follow only his orders, who are programmed only to obey him...but like all master plans, this one has a few glitches. Like, what happens when a superhuman suddenly gets a mind of its own?Deucalion was Victor's first creation. He has spent two hundred years in hiding...and has just found out his creator's plans. Traveling to New Orleans, Deucalion hooks up with two cops: Carson O'Connor, a street-wise cop as beautiful as she is deadly, and Michael Maddison, sarcastic but dangerous. Their goal: to stop a demented serial killer...and make sure they put a hault to Victor Helios's plans before it's too late. If the deadline hasn't already passed, that is...\\"Prodigal Son\\" is gripping and unforgettable. I thought I would hate it; my all-time favorite author, Dean Koontz, reworking an old legend into a new story--it sounded like a recipe for disaster. I almost didn't buy the book. I'm glad I did. This novel is chock-full of humor, suspense, terror, quantum physics, horror, romance, suspense...everything you expect from a good Koontz book (this one also reminded me of Koontz's older work...you know, the buddy-cop novels with a twist).Dean Koontz and Keven J. Anderson's \\"Prodigal Son\\" is a great beginning to what may become a legendary series. Don't miss this book, not if you're a fan of great horror/suspense. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"The idea to keep the original story intact and just bring us a new chapter 200 years later is just great! The story, as usual with a Koontz book, unfolds at break neck speed. I mean it never lows down, right up to the very last page! Be forwarned, there is nothing that even comes close to closure in this book. Its as if they wrote the entire story and picked the most suspenceful parts and end the book there. Then smiling , they watch as we anxiously wait for next volume to come.If you like Koontz, horror or SiFi please go out and get this book. But take one word of advice, you may want to wait till we are a little closer to the release date for the second book. I'm in anguish knowing I have to wait four months!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"It had to be New Orleans because the plot meandered around the city like the chronicles of a certain vampire-loving raconteur from the Big Easy. Don't misunderstand me, I admire the detail, but get on with the story. If I wanted excessive minutia, I'd read Crichton. Too many details derail the rising action and sidetrack the attention span. These characters burn tissue thin except for the side show freaks including Deucalion. He deserved the story and not the two dimensional, reiterated clones that became as souless as their flat egotistical creator (I guess Helios meant that he is the center of the solar system and not just this world). I hope if I live 200 years I will not become as concerned with humanity that I find the need to control it through a B-movie motivation. Helios deserved more. Mr. Sinister in Marvel Comics played more convincing than Helios. I wanted to like this novel since I adored the Modern Prometheus and the Dune prequels, but where was the story? More matter and less art next time! I won't be tagging along for the extended tour of New Orleans for the next book. Sorry."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author. On to the review: I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through. The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable. Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held. \\"You drive too fast!\\" \\"Are you my mother?\\" Over and over and over.The idea was good. A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster. But you get what I'm saying.). But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play. This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"All I want to do is click on the stars to indicate how much I liked a book.

But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his \\"perfect race\\" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and \\"at one with the universe\\" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole \\"story\\" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I just completed book one and it was great.

The monster -- Deucalion-- is called from Tibet to New Orleans because someone has recognized the true identity of a famous philantrophist: Victor Helios.Helios has a plan to infiltrate mankind with his superior creations which he refers to as the \\"New Race.\\" (I'm reminded of Damaskinos's \\"infected\\" Reaper vampires in the second BLADE movie-- more lethal than the \\"true-born\\" vampires.)Helios, in the process of growing them (they cannot breed) has engineered in them (apart from supernatural strenght and intelligence), the desire to obey only him and strangely enough a command that will NOT allow them to destroy themselves. (I wondered how HELIOS, a UTOPIAN, would consider this necessary, if he had created a MASTER RACE?) Anyway, something has gone wrong!! SURPRISE! Some of his creations are beginning to think more than they should? They want to find the Bluebird of Happiness but they don't know how! They are, in a sense, becoming infected by the ordinary humans they are intended to supplant.Note: Of particular interest is Koontz's serial killer, Roy Pribeaux, who has to be up there with Hannibal Lecter. His psychology is one the more \\"breathtaking\\" ones to be found in thrillers. How he manifests his hatred of unattractive people is \\"morbidly funny\\".Erika, Viktor's vat-grown bride who is bred to be a wife and with a measure of \\"free will\\" or at least Viktor's definition of it.And the literary treatment of 2 autistic characters: one human called Arnie who may be mildly precognitive and shares a talent with Deucalion . . . and Randal 6 who is engineered to be autistic!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I was totally blown away by Koontz's update of the Frankenstein tale and loved every page of it.

It satisfied some loose ends, yet left me wanting and waiting for the next book.

Talk about frustrating! Now I see Koontz has book #2 ready to sell his legions of fans, who can overlook what now seems as an obvious effort to milk two sales out of what should have been one book. No doubt I will bite..no pun intended..but not happily and hoping this is not his version of a Frankenstein series."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I've liked Koontz for years, but recently started reading more of his work. When I learned of this book, his version of the Frankenstien myth, I just had to check it out. Just as I expected, the story swept me away with a high caliber of writing, intriguing characters and a plot that kept me interested all the way through to the end. If you are looking for classic Dean Koontz, you won't be dissapointed. This is, however, the first in a series, so while there is some resolution in the end, much is left wide open for the following books. If you've never read Dean Koontz, this is a great book to start with-it is a well-told story that adds to and magnifies Mary Shelly's tale. Oh, and one more thing: the chapters are all fairly short, which is something I haven't seen in a Dean Koontz novel. Those of you out there who don't have much time to read (much less think) will enjoy quick chapters that leave you wanting more.

And the ending?This was just awful."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This novel honestly makes me question the skill level of Koontz as a writer. Or maybe his editor is to blame. My assumption is that Koontz has so many bestsellers his editor doesn't even proof anything anymore, or Koontz refuses to let anyone meddle with his first drafts. This is most clearly exhibited in the changes in past and present tense strewn throughout the book. At first I thought certain parts were taking place in the present, and others were slightly in the past, leading up to other events taking place, but no. Within chapters it was changing. A setting or character would described in the present and then the action would take place in the past. I kept wondering if I was missing something, but no, by the end it became clear that everything was happening at the same time. No storyline was farther along than another.The story itself is solid and was enough to keep me reading, though mostly just to see where he was going with all this. The cops were alright because I'm a sucker for cop stories, but they were very wooden. As for the love aspects, if the characters were wooden like a soft birch, the love situation was a very solid oak, possibly a pine. For all the magical elements I had no trouble believing, I could not suspend my disbelief in regards to the people and their thoughts and actions.I also have a problem with the book's pop culture references. They're all clunky. I was weary when Deucalion and a monk were chatting about Cheezits for the first six pages of the book, and my fears were solid. Dean tried to reinvent the Frankenstein concept in a world that understood itself based on pop culture, as understood in our reality by a 50-year-old nerd (Koontz). I laughed countless times (\\". . . had it been Barney the Dinosaur things may have gone differently.\\" LOLZ). By the end I was pitying the poor guy.This book doesn't seem like the product of a professional writer. I read stories like this in creative writing classes.Maybe read it. Probably don't."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume.

While it was very well written and edited, it was left with a huge cliffhanger. I understand this is part of a series but I personally prefer for a book to be somewhat wrapped up before going onto the next one. This book just suddenly ended in the middle of a scene.

Namely, his rewriting of the classic horror story done in modern times.It does have a bizarre start, one dealing with Deucalion not in the city, but in the mountains of Tibet, and you briefly meet a likable monk who's humorous. Then the deadly message that starts off the adventure of Deucalion's life: his extremely arrogant maker, Victor Frankenstein is back, with a new name, but same old face.Before the entire thing starts, though, there's a good quote from C. S. Lewis about laughing at virtue while being shocked about traitors in our midst- pointing out how we contradict ourselves with our own double-standards. Oh, the irony of human beings. And irony is what this story's built on; two hard cops (one of which is a total comic relief) teaming up with a freak show of a man, a genetically engineered autistic child in search of another autistic child (because he smiled in a picture), genetic meat machines who hate their creator (as well as humans), and subtle meanings behind names. Quite a bit of the humor was top-notch, and so was the extreme pride of Victor with how he taunts Deucalion and viciously beats his wife (he's a sexual sadist, what'd you expect?) and expecting perfection with every created wife he makes (apparently slurping's not in his list of good qualities).Then there's the secondary plot- one of a killer taking \\"perfect organs\\" fom women he considers angelically beautiful to try to create his own wife. What a poetic ending he gets. From someone else with an actual living tumor in him. And that tumor causes quite a stir in the ending. And that ending is where I see people's reactions to Koontz's brand of horror, dark environments and visual references to other authors to help enhance the eeriness.For his first book I'd read, I've got to hand it to him, he did make a great first impression on me."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz did a very good job of putting a twist on the story of Frankenstein.

Well, I've been researching the series, and I notice the last three books have lower ratings than the first two, but nonetheless, I decided to go with Prodigal Son just to get away from the supernatural. The first few chapters got me! As got me as I couldn't put it down easily.I liked the idea of having Victor living for two hundred years, and he's running New Orleans. The idea of the New Race which seemed to what look like humans, but underneath, they're monsters (like two hearts, and organs of unknown uses).Then about past halfway through, there's a twist, and the story changed it's main enemy to this character which I won't spoil.

I was not disappointed! Koontz introduces a take-over of horrific proportions, where human kind is faced with a new and terrifying race that has been designed by the murderous and powerful Victor Frankenstein. Koontz introduces a scientific world that is both fascinating and terrifying.

There were a lot of characters introduced and I spent most of the book trying to figure out why. It became apparent towards the end, but the journey was a little disappointing to me. I wanted more of Deucalion as he was a very vivid character to me, but he was barely in the book. I have a feeling that the next book in the series may be a little more exciting so I'm going to give it read. I just hope that we've had enough back ground information given in Prodigal Son so that City of Night can be the page turner I'm hoping for."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I began reading this series when it first came out. I tore through Book 1 and 2 and was totally enthralled with the characters and plot. By the time I had finished those two, the third book still hadn't been published yet, and I lost track of the series while reading other stuff in between. I only recently rediscovered the series and was very pleased to find that there are now many more volumes.I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for about 15 years now, and I enjoy his writing style. It changes depending on which character's perspective he's writing from - dimmer characters are written in short, newspaper-like sentences, for example. He has a wonderful way of describing the setting (New Orleans) in these books, without belaboring insignificant details, and you can almost feel the humidity and smell the curry as he's writing about Carson and Michael.The plot is as described in the listing. This is NOT a re-telling of the Frankenstein story. It's a continuation that answers the question \\"What would Victor Frankenstein be doing if he were living in today's society?\\". I find that fascinating, and the books do not disappoint.If you like monster stories and very well thought-out, interwoven stories, you'll like this. If you prefer a linear narration from one character's point of view from start to finish, this isn't for you. There are parts that are gory, but Koontz doesn't give them any more time or detail than he does any other aspects of the book. I can't wait to keep reading and see what's next!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This book would probably have to be the best work of fiction I have ever read, and I have read a lot of fiction. Short chapters, follows all of the characters so you have every aspect of the story line. Very interesting and just up my ally, hits very close to home.

Very good book though."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I received this book as a gift since I am a Koontz fan, but I wasn't too sure about this one. I was afraid it would focus more on the graphic horror than telling a good story. Boy was I wrong. I really enjoyed how he has taken such a familiar tale and reworked it to fit modern times. It sucked me in from the beginning and I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for Book 2."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I originally bought this book for the kindle, and by the moment I started reading it to the time that I finished it I immediatly wanted to read more...so what did I do?

Something about Deucalion is strangly romantic causing people to be drawn quickly to the story. I highly reccomend this book to people who love thrillers."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This novel brings a classic legend up to date by replacing Victor Frankenstein's previously crude monster creation techniques with biotech engineering, cloning, and computer programming. Victor has learned the secret of long life and is still alive and well in 21st century New Orleans. Now a respected scientist and wealthy member of high society by day, Victor practices his high-tech life creation projects by night in order to create perfect beings, totally obedient to his will. He seeds his creations throughout the city so that they can undermine, and eventually replace, humanity and lead to a perfect New Age society. In the meanwhile, Frankenstein's original monster, now called Deucalion, is also gifted with immortality. He learns of his creator's existence and sets off for New Orleans to seek revenge. When a series of gruesome murders occur where body parts are removed from the victims, two police detectives try to track down the killer. Is one of Frankenstein's creations to blame?The portrayal of Frankenstein's creatures is especially interesting. Created with a carefully controlled blend of human emotion and programmed behavior, they are at times confused about their feelings. Sometimes their human component fights against their artificial one, with interesting results. In a clever turnabout, Victor Frankenstein is portrayed as a monster and Deucalion has evolved to show more human traits than his creator. At first I was amused by the fact that immortality has become a popular pursuit, and that others in the story besides Frankenstein and his creations are capable of prolonged lives and physical perfection. Yet the real-world popularity of plastic surgery, nutritional supplements, and health clubs does prove that art imitates life.Koontz originally wrote this story as a two-hour script for a television series pilot for the USA Network. When the producer requested major changes, Koontz pulled out of the project and decided to rewrite the story in book form in order to preserve the original concept. This book is only the first in a series of novels about Frankenstein and his progeny. Although I was expecting the story to have a few loose ends to pave the way for the next in the series, the ending could have been a bit less abrupt. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story and am eagerly awaiting the next in the series.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz does and excellent job with his take on Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. The story takes place in modern day and Victor Frankenstein (now better known as Victor Helios)has been alive for centuries creating his super human \\"New Race\\" of people who he plans to one day control to wipe out man kind (the \\"Old Race\\")and create his vision of a more powerful productive world. Now it is up to Detectives O'Conner and Maddison with the help of Victores original monster who now goes by the name Deacullion to stop Victor and his New Race and save mankind.This was a great book that was hard to put down. If you have the time its very easy to read in one sitting. It offers suspense, excitment and a bit of humor. Highly recomended for all Koontz fans."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Though a fan of Koontz, when I first saw the title of this book I was afraid it would be trite. But I was wrong. This is one of Koontz's best efforts in years. He does not rewrite the story of Frankenstein, rather, he builds on it.It is the present day and Dr. Frankenstein is alive and well and continuing his efforts. His goal is more clarified. He is no tragic figure, but an evil man bent on building a race of perfect beings that will replace humanity. Over the two hundred years since the events portrayed in Mary Shelley's book (which, in an nice twist, is explained as a semi-historical account based on legends and hearsay), Dr. Frankenstein has amassed a fortune and a vast biotech empire. Through modern genetics and science, he no longer has to piece together his creations from dead humans. He grows them and programs them with directives and information. He and his creations bide their time, infiltrate humanity, and await the time to strike openly.Opposing these efforts is Dr. Frakenstein's first creation. The Monster still lives, but has become more and more human while his creator has become less. Koontz and Anderson do a great job of portraying the monster as a suffering man, noble in spirit yet malformed in body. His path and mission cross paths with two homocide detectives on the trail of one of the New Race who has become a serial killer after he realizes that his programing and superior genetics has left him empty, missing something that humans seem to possess.Koontz and Anderson's decision to place the story in New Orleans was a stroke of genius. They do a good job of capturing the mood of what is perhaps America's most foreign, haunted city. The food, the history, the music, the graveyards. All are effecitvely portrayed and woven into the story.The book is a quick read, with 4-5 page chapters dealing with one sequence of events, the moving to another. Despite this, it does not come across choppy. The writers keep the pace going while making the narrative clear.A good book. Reminscent of, though not quite at the level of, Koontz's excellent Twilight Eyes."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"The story offers little by way of surprise. Yes, it's about Frankenstein. Yes, that Frankenstein. We learn that Viktor Frankenstein was a real person, not merely a figment of Mary Shelley's imagination. Two hundred years ago, he learned so much about the human body from his experiments that he succeeded in creating a semi-human being--the original Frankenstein monster. He also learned how to augment his own body in order to defy death.Two hundred years later, Frankenstein is still alive and living under an alias in (pre-Hurricane Katrina) New Orleans, where he is still creating \\"new\\" humans in the hope of eventually repopulating the earth with his super-race, eliminating the \\"old\\" humans, and becoming the godlike ruler of the world.His first creation is still around as well. He's given himself the name Deucalion (after the Noah-like ark builder of ancient Greek mythology) and has been living a life of seclusion in a Buddhist monastery in Asia. When Frankenstein created Deucalion, he hadn't yet learned the finer points of making his \\"new\\" people look exactly like the \\"old\\" humans, so Deucalion is horribly disfigured. He's shy, gentle, huge, ugly, and basically your all-around likeable 200-year-old nice giant.When Deucalion learns that Frankenstein is still alive, he sets out for New Orleans to kill him before he can carry out his evil plans. Meanwhile, one of Frankenstein's new creations has gone haywire and begun a killing spree in the Big Easy. The cops are stymied by the mysterious case, and their problems are only compounded by the fact that unknown to them, one of the detectives working on the case is a member of Frankenstein's new race. Things come to a head when Deucalion joins forces with the cops and the fact that there are strange human-like beings with two hearts and other obviously engineered features running around the city comes to light.This is the first in a trio of books about the strangely deathless Frankenstein and the problems brought about by his sinister creativity. The book's characters are reasonably well developed, and the settings are brought to life with lavishly descriptive prose, neither of which is surprising in a Dean Koontz book. More surprising is the amount of sexual content--way to much in my view. Profanity is kept to a reasonable level, but the violence and gore is a bit over the top at times.All in all, I liked the book. My main hesitation in recommending it is that there doesn't seem to be any real reason to read it. Whereas the original Frankenstein was a social morality tale masked in a horror story, this is pretty much just a horror story with little to commend it by way of a moral. Readers who want a scary book that will challenge them to think would be better off reading Koontz's much earlier (and solo) work Watchers, a Frankenstein-like story about the dangers of genetic manipulation and social hierarchies."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son is one of Dean Koontz's best novels. It is fast-paced, full of action and suspense, and the characters are ones you become attached to. Definitely a page turner...I couldn't put it down.

Warning: Once you've read this, you'll have to read #2...and if you liked it as much as I did, you'll probably end up angry that #3 isn't out yet.

I hadn't previously been a big Dean Koontz reader, having only read maybe 2-3 of his stories, but the idea of a new Frankenstein story intrigued me. I was definitely not disappointed in any way with this story. It almost felt like light-hearted reading compared to some of the other stuff that I had read recently. While not as much as I'm used to, it had enough action and gore to keep me going, and what a great story it contains! I zipped through the first two books just in time for that supposed 'Winter '06' Book 3 release, and I have yet to see anything further about it. I really want to see how this story continues, and I think anyone even slightly curious about this story will feel the same. If you happened to catch the movie that was released related to this, don't even bother comparing....the book is SO much better"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Koonz is the only author that I've ever read where I either love or hate the book. I have to say, the first two Frankenstein books are the best of the best. I pessimistically began this book thinking, \\"How is he going to pull of Frankenstein living in the 21st century?\\" Not only did Koontz pull it off, he did it with flying colors. The book reads fast, there is the right mix of understated humor and supernatural story telling, combined with well developed characters that hold the readers interest. I'd recommend reading both books one and two, as the final installment of the trilogy is due out in early 07."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I resisted reading this book, even tho I am fond of Koontz's books. It just sounded trite and boring to me. But I finally caved and got it. What a surprise that it was just loads of fun. Yes, it was grisly (after all, we are talking Frankenstein here), but it had Mr. Koontz's usual good pacing and story telling, believable characters, etc. I look forward to the next installment, which I will certainly not resist reading!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I'm not much of a Dean Koontz fan; his tendency to use \`deus ex machina' to resolve plots and such has always put me off. I'm also not much of a fan of the horror genre anyway, so I rarely read Koontz. However I had heard a bunch about this series, including the rumor that Martin Scorsese had at one time expressed in interest in producing it for TV. Anyway, I was really kind of glad to read this and see that Koontz had put a little life and a novel twist to the old story. I'm actually looking forward to the next two parts."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Having recently finished Velocity, which had me hooked until the abrupt and meaningless ending, Koontz's modern spin on a classic tale is tremendous through and through, except for the fact that it had to end somewhere.Koontz sets up a brilliant storyline, beginning with the gruesome yet loveable Deucalion, otherwise known as Dr. Frankenstein's first creation. Weaving in series of characters from their viewpoints, including a homicidal female body part-collecting freak, Victor Helios (Dr. Frankenstein, who through his own bio-technology and enhancement has been able to keep himself alive for all these years), the doctor's wife, and a young autistic creation of Frankenstein's whose fascination with crosswords and order keep him somewhat sane.The only thing that I would have changed, had I been the author, would be the character that collects female body parts. The fact that he was neither a creation, nor involved with Helios or anyone else, until Helios had him taken out, was a bit odd to me. He was undoubtedly a fascinating character; however, his relevance to the story is a mystery to me and seemed to just be a faade for adding a bit more length or meat to the novel.Other than that minor detail, which subtracted an imperceptible amount from the book, I loved the book and it was an extraordinarily fast read. The next thing I plan to do is pick up the sequel and continue to follow the tales of the valiant Deucalion and his treacherous architect."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz is one of the best genre writers working today. I have read most of his fifty plus novels, and I think PRODIGAL SON ranks as one of his best recent efforts.PRODIGAL SON is the first in a planned trilogy of books that retells the story of Frankenstein in modern times. Book Two was released last year and the final volume will be released next summer. Like most fans, I'm eagerly awaiting that third book, which is over a year late.The plot of PRODIGAL SON is very enteraining and fast-paced. It has very short chapters, kind of like a James Patterson novel. This is a good book for younger readers, since it is written in a very simple, staightforward style.If you're new to Koontz, this is a very good place to start. Some of Koontz' books are somehwat overwritten and tedious, but PRODIGAL SON does not fall into that category. This isn't a great novel, but it's tons of fun.If you like this book, I recommend reading some of Koontz' earlier work, such as WATCHERS, ODD THOMAS, MIDNIGHT, and DRAGON TEARS."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"this is the first koontz's book that i readit really is a fantastic book to read and very intriguing too..it makes me think how a \\"monster\\" like deucalion can find peace in tibet and it intrigues me on how these \\"monsters\\" keep on searching on what can make them happy..one of the element in this book is perfection and it shows that perfection doesn't exist.. sure, physically these monsters have it all, two hearts, immunity to pain but what makes them crazy and truly a monster is their quest to what really is missing in them, emotion, the true feeling of happiness...the story flows smoothly that i just want to keep going to get to the bottom of it..another thing that is also a plus for me is that koontz mentioned about autism, carson's brother who is autistic and also one of victor's creation which was based on autism..it was an eye opener for me...and i'm really looking forward to read the 2nd installment and also the rest of his books..truly amazing!!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I have mixed feelings about Dean Koontz - some times I like his writing and sometimes it doesn't work for me at all. But the idea of retelling and extending the Frankenstein legend appealed to me for many reasons, first of all, it is one of those quintessential horror stories that combine pure horror with questions of rebirth and immortality. And secondly, no one has ever quite gotten it right since Mary Shelley first penned what is really one of the first great works of science fiction.In Koontz's work Baron Frankenstein has ceased to be a sympathetic researcher fighting to prove that life can be created. Something in his mind broke on that desperate night when his creature first awoke, and the doctor has pursued the creation of life not because it is a miracle, but because he wants to replace humanity with creatures of his own engineering, replacing our chaos with a cold utopian world where he is the ultimate tyrant. Now he pursues his dark science as Victor Helios, on of New Orleans most respected citizens by day, and a sadistic experimenter by night.When his original creation, who now calls himself Deucalion (the Greek version of Noah), finds that Victor Frankenstein still lives, and is the end of humanity, Mary Shelley's monster realizes he must oppose his creator. For in living in a human world Deucalion has discovered the humanity in himself that Frankenstein left behind. The monster is human now, and the human has become a monster. One who has been insinuating his creations into society long enough to be untouchable by the law.Almost coincidentally another monster wanders the streets of New Orleans, a serial killer who is desperately looking for something he knows is missing from himself. As he reaps 'perfect' parts for his own collection he runs afoul of the evil he imitates. Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison join to hunt the killer down and find that the complex clues lead to more than they bargained for and that Deucalion may be their only hope of survival.Dean Koontz (and Kevin Anderson, who gets a byline) do a great job of taking a plot that Koontz originally intended to be a TV special and making into the first novel of a trilogy which mixed serial killers and mad scientists with aplomb. Koontz has always had a talent for developing his characters, whether they be human or not and one again he manages to bring this story to life in such a fashion as to make it stay with you even when the last page goes by. If the books continue at this level, horror lovers are in for a rare treat."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"As expected, Dean Koontz has once again \\"done it\\". It was hard to put this book down, and even harder to make it last. I just hope he never stops writing. Worth every penny and more."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"How do you make a Koontz novel better? More monsters! More intertwined story lines! More heroes!I found this book exciting and extremely hard to put down. I found the usual Koontz witty style of writing, which I love. I also enjoyed this book more because there were more storylines to follow and they all collide which each other very nicely. Very well thought out.The character development is also very well done. Each character complex and likeable or hateable. But, as each character develops, there are zero dull spots in the book, as some novelists spend too much time trying to develop characers with too many words.The evil in this book outdoes most of Koontz's earler works. Sometimes I worry about Koontz, because these characters are so twisted and warped, I don't know if Koontz is quite sane or not.I loved it and look forward to Book 2. It's a great modern take off of the original Frankenstein story. Well worth the time of any thriller/horror readers!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"One reviewer feels Koontz occasionally becomes too impressed with his own literary abilities. But that is exactly the reason I've read every single one of his books and cannot wait until the second book in this series is released. Unlike Stephen King, whose maudlin character portrayals and expletive-laden language often leaves me yearning for true literature instead of modern writing, Koontz has a way of seducing me with his words. This book is no exception. What a gift to watch Koontz don Mary Shelly's mantle and make her masterpiece not only come alive once more, but take it to yet a higher level. Koontz's character studies, particularly his portrayal of the monster-becoming-human Deucalion, not only succeeded in making it impossible to put this book down, but also left me in the throes of anticipation until July 26th, the release date of City of Night. Bravo yet once again, Mr. Koontz. Bravo, and Encore. I would gladly share a bag of Cheez-Its with you and Deucalion any day."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This is my first Koontz book but it was so uneven that I didn't need to see the cover to know this was written by two authors. Actually, it is more likely that, KJA wrote the book from what Koontz wrote for made-for TV treatment. Hence the short chapters or quick \\"cuts\\". The short chapters are not the problem though. Indeed, I think they prevent it from there being a bigger one. His(their?) two detective characters are OK, and when together they are quite entertaining, a little stereotypical, but still fun to be around. Then we have the quintessential stereotype, The Mad Scientist and they had a lot of difficulty bringing across what a being spanning 200 years might be experiencing. They tried. The only character that truly stood out was the Monster-Frankenstein's original creation who calls himself Deucalion at the time of this book and here they were more successful in conveying a sense of a creature transcending time. Perhaps reading all that Frank Herbert helped KJA with this. All I am certain of is that I could hardly wait for Deucalion to re-appear and he didn't nearly often enough. He had the greatest depth, and was for me, the character I could relate with best and hence he carried the book for me. I have tried reading three of Koontz's latest books but put them down somewhere and am not actively looking for them. There's no arguing the undoubtedly deserved popularity Mr. Koontz enjoys and the fact that he can conceive of this marvelous \\"What If\\" extension to the Frankenstein classic suggests there is more to him than meets the eye. I just expected more based on that reputation. The book does get 3 stars because it was a fun and fast read and has a character who is developing nicely in Deucalion. I will read the sequel(s) but I am sure one of his fans will buy them first and then lend them to me. If the entire series holds up at this level I will no problem purchasing them for my library. So, while it is neither resounding nor ringing, it is an endorsement, and as Koontz admired a favorite author of mine, the late John D. McDonald, I figured that we must have some common ground. After the aborted starts of three of his other books, this book might just be it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I have loved Dean Koontz for years but his books of late have gotten away from the reason I fell in love with his stories... All I can say is HE'S BACK! I can't wait for the 2nd book!! I could not put this down,it made me breathless the whole way through!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"The only Dean Koontz book I've read is Phantoms. I don't honestly remember much about it other than the Twilight Zone-style opening.So, when I came across this paperback (on sale) at the grocery store, I chuckled to myself. I do enjoy the myth behind Frankenstein and Dracula, and I'm always amazed that modern writers can't seem to leave them alone.Once I picked up the book, I read the foreward, and discoverd that Koontz was originally writing this story for a USA movie. Some of you may remember USA's modern spin on Frankenstein -- it was one part stylish invention, two parts terrible writing, and one part bad acting. Koontz discusses the problems he encountered writing for USA, and how his idea was eventually dropped. This book is the direction he wanted to go with the story.If you saw the movie, you know a lot of the background for this novel -- Victor and his monster are still living (in New Orleans, no doubt), while the doctor attempts to create a New Race. In essense, it's an update of the Frankenstein mystique, with a modern genetic research twist.While a number of things are different between the movie and the novel, there are enough similarities (including all the characters), that you'll feel as though you've read this before. Fortunately, even if you've seen the movie, the last half of the book departs enough from the film to give the reader something new to discover.As is no doubt customary of Koontz's writing style, the novel is plot driven, with characters represented in broad strokes, and dialogue written in a rapid-fire fashion. The scenes are well presented, the action is fluid, and the background story is deep enough to help maintain the necessary tension.If you're looking for something subtle and thought provoking, you might want to try another book; however, if you're just hunting a quick, fun read, it might work for you."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is a somewhat twist on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein except the characters are known on a more superfical and macabred level. This book, although clearly fictious, raised a lot of poignant questions concerning human meaning and purpose to the point of being disturbing. Victor Frankenstein was portrayed, not as a helpless man who accidently created a monster, but as an evil-doer whose purpose and aim in creating the \\"New Race\\", similar to that of Huxley in \\"Brave New World.\\" All in all an interesting novel that seemed to get a lot of its ideas from Shelley's novel although creatively distanced itself from her confine. There was one part of the book I did not see the relevance of- the part concerning Roy Pribeaux. He seems to take up a good deal of the first half of the novel and if his soul purpose was just to introduce the character of Harker, it seems a bit unneccessary. I do not plan on reading the second novel in Koontz's series but, as expected, the ending was not an ending at all but an introduction to the second book, so dont expect much.

I am disappointed that this was not made into a TV series/special becasuse it is excellent. Great characters! The lead police characters had a great rapport and believeable dialog.

This is one of those books. This is my 3rd Koontz novel and I must say the best I've read so far. I enjoyed Odd Thomas, hated Forever Odd, and absolutely loved Frankenstein.The story starts with Victor's first, Deucalion living amount monks and then shifts to America. The book shifts from chapter to chapter each character's part in the story. I had no trouble liking the characters you are supposed to like (Michael, Carson, Deucalion, Erika, etc) and no trouble disliking Victor. I think in this terrifying retelling of an old tale, you really wonder, did Dr. Frankenstein live? Is his creature alive and real?Victor has ambitions to replace the Old Race with his New Race of manmade people. However, things aren't going as planned. His wife shows feelings, his severed head is stronger than he thought, Randall Six is on a mission, and his \\"children\\" are killing to find what they are missing.If you are looking for a great book with a twist on a classic, this is for you."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Set in exotic New Orleans, Dr. Victor Helios (aka Dr. Frankenstein) is still alive, and still practicing his wicked ways behind the faade of running a legitimate business called Helios Biovision. At the abandoned Hands Of Mercy Hospital, instead of simply reanimating corpses, Victor is using new technology not only to extend his own life but to create life from scratch. His new technology includes direct-to-brain downloads so his creations emerge fully ready to take on their roles in life. Creations like Erika Four, his lovely custom made wife, the fourth he's gone through so far; and Randal Six, who's been created with autism so that Victor can experiment with using autism to develop more focused workers.The monster, born of the grave, also immortal and now calling himself Deucalion, is living in Tibet with a group of monks. When he receives a letter informing him that Victor is still alive, Deucalion decides he must travel into the real world again to find a way to destroy Victor. He travels to New Orleans and moves into the Luxe Theater with his old carnival friend Jelly Biggs.Detectives Carson O'Conner and Michael Maddison are assigned to the case of a new serial killer who's killing young ladies and removing specific body parts from them (hands, eyes, ears, etc). The bodies of three men missing internal organs complicate the case. The killer has been nicknamed The Surgeon, and partners O'Conner and Maddison must find him before he strikes again. Aside from her tight work schedule, Carson is also caring for her autistic younger brother Arnie.Strange bodies turn up at the morgue, Carson runs into a mysterious man claiming there are more like him \\"out there\\", and Victor continues his evil experiments. Reviving Frankenstein sounds like it would be a weak or clich&eacute;d idea, but Koontz and Anderson pull it off. Despite pilfered ideas from the old Black & White movies The Frozen Dead and The Brain That Wouldn't Die, not to mention a character similar to one already created in Koontz's 'Hideaway', there's enough new and unique material in the story to make it dynamic and highly entertaining. Watch out, the book ends in a real cliffhanger, so you'll want to have book two, 'City Of Night', already beside your elbow. Although I became disappointed in Koontz after 'Mr. Murder', it seems he's regained his old formula with this Frankenstein series and written a seat-of-your-pants novel. I recommend this book to horror and thriller fans. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I'd only read the first three Odd Thomas books of Koontz's, but thought I'd try Frankenstein, because the review on Amazon said it was not a rehash of the old tale. And, it wasn't. It's a refreshing twist on the resurfacing of the madman (he was never destroyed, and actually resents that Shelley woman's story), but with a clean dash of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a pinch of James Lee Burke's detective angle, all with a flavor of hi-test horror. I'm starting on Vol 2 tonight!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Very creepy, but Koontz telegraphs the next horrible action again and again. Not up to his usual standards at all. Shipping and condition of book was, as usual, perfect in this case however."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This book is amazing on so many levels. It takes the traditional Frankenstein story and weaves a modern tale of secrets, deception, and corruption hidden under a thin veneer of high society. It is creepy how probable some of the things in this book are. It is a sad tale, but it pulls you in and won't let go. I would recommend this book for anyone with a healthily inquisitive mind and a bit of empathy."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I liked this book, but I can understand why some wouldn't. Koontz is so obsessed with Quantum physics and the possiblities of parallel universes, that all of his books seem to fall back on that theme. After reading this some years ago, I read more of his work and it shows up to some extent in every one I've read. If you can just roll with that and enjoy it for what it is, a story, then it's a pretty good tale. I didn't get the feeling it was a re-telling of the old Frankenstein, but just taking the bare essentials from it and spinning a whole new yarn for modern readers obsessed with aliens, vampires and werewolves. The \\"New Race\\" is everything rolled up into one.I won't go to each book in this series and leave an individual review, instead I will comment on all here. I enjoyed the second book as much as the first, but the third book, for me, was a disappointment. By then end of that one, I felt as if he was dragging it out for the fans who didn't want it to end. I picked up the fourth one in the grocery store when I came across it accidently. I had no idea he was continuing the series, but since I'd read the rest I picked it up. I just finished it and wasn't expecting to find that I would have to buy yet another to complete the story. Book 4 is Part 1 and Book 5 is Part 2. Although I assume it will all work out, of course, I find this annoying. I thought the book seemed rather small, so I don't think it was necessary to split it up to get another few bucks out of people. The fourth book was OK, I guess, and I will get the other eventually to find out what happens, but please, Mr. Koontz, enough already. This series needs to be put to bed. If you really need something to do, go back to working on the Odd Thomas series."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Very much Dean Koontz, but I do wish he had provided a little more background on Victor's first creation and what happened post Shelly."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This novel was a little confusing and even baffling at times. Oh, I worked it out and read the second one and then waited and waited and waited for the third one ... but I haven't read that one yet, and I've learned there are others after that. I'll have to get busy! Koontz is a masterful story teller and I am so happy he is a prolific as he is. I do enjoy his books and will continue to do so as long as I can read!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I see a lot of bantering about who actually wrote this novel. Was it Koontz or Anderson? Truthfully? I really don't care. Unlike other co-authored books, I mostly find awful, I liked this one.The author does a good job bringing Victor Helios (Dr. Frankenstein) into the 21st century using modern technology to create his \\"New Race.\\"Helios (The Father) is pretty well nuts. I wish there was a bit more depth to his character.There's a couple of cops working the opposite end of this story. They do provide some tongue in cheek comic relief to Victor's gore. Naturally, they're a bit blown away & mystified by some of what they discover. The book has it's share of gore for a Koontz novel. Mr. Koontz also weaves his way through the book very well. After all, it is one of his best traits.I know this is the first in a series of Frankenstein novels, but the ending suffers greatly. There is no sense of conclusion to anything. There's no hanging thread to lead the reader into the next installment. The book ends very abruptly. One almost feels the last page has been torn out. Ready for some sort of ending, one instead, finds a lead-in to one of Koontz next books. I found it a major shortcoming for the novel.One more thing: Doesn't Kevin Anderson's name deserve to be on the cover? What's with the omission?"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This first book in a series of collaborations between Koontz and a number of other authors was written with Kevin J. Anderson (well known for his work in the Dune prequels). It is a fun start for a very original spin on a classic story. In this book, the Frankenstein legend is re-imagined in a modern way. Koontz is always full of surprises and odd twists, and this is no exception. I enjoyed this book a great deal by appreciating it for the light-hearted entertainment that it is. Now I just have to search my stockpile of books to figure out where I stuck the first sequel. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This book is the first book in Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series. It is co-authored by Kevin J. Anderson. For a book about Frankenstein and his monster, this book offers a very different perspective from earlier renditions of the story. In all, it is an interesting read.Deucalion has been living in a Tibetan Monastery for several years as he finds some peace there (although he misses Cheez-Its). When he discovers that his creator still lives, he has to leave in search of him, so that he can find some way to destroy the evil man. His search brings him to Louisiana where a rash of murders involving body parts being stolen has been happening. He also discovers that Victor has been busy. Under the guise of Victor Helios, he has been creating yet more people in an effort to create the perfect race and eventually eliminate mankind from the world. Among these creations are Randall 6, who is obsessed with puzzles, is autistic, and is very interesting in an autistic boy named Arnie.Investigating these murders is a woman named Carson O'Connor and her partner Michael. Aside from caring for her brother Arnie, Carson is dedicated to her job and finding the murderer behind all these brutal killings. Meeting Deucalion definitely changes some of her perspectives though. There is more in the crime world going on than she imagines, and it will be very tough to stop.The characters in this book are done pretty well. I think maybe that Victor is a little too evil though as he does not seem to have any redeeming qualities, which is a bit unbelievable. Another flaw in characterization was that Michael, one of the cops, was supposed to be pretty sarcastic and funny, but a lot of his jokes just fell flat for me. Deucalion, although not appearing as much as you would expect, is done exceptionally well and is a riveting character.The writing, having been done by two authors, is done well. Each chapter focuses around several different characters, yet despite this, the story reads pretty cohesively. There is a bit of gore, and some nasty descriptions of food, so this book may not be the best for those with weak stomachs or younger children. One fault I do find with the writing is the numerous mentions of pop-culture items (like the aforementioned Cheez-Its) which personally, I cannot stand in a book.Overall though this is an interesting series and I look forward to the next book. Since this one ended in a cliffhanger, I'll be sure to get to the next as quickly as I can.Prodigal SonCopyright 2005469 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"There is a murderer on the loose and it is Carson and Michael's job to find the killer. Harker (another member of the New Orleans Homicide division) is attempting to find peace with himself. Deucalion only wishes to finish what he has started. Victor is trying to make his world perfect. Roy is trying to complete his mission of making himself perfect and finding the perfect girl for himself.This book was filled with many side stories, that, while I was reading it I was unsure how everything would fall into place. After you get a third of the way into the story, you realize that you are following two different stories, one of Carson and Michael along with the New Orleans Homicide division and the other of Victor and Deucalion. When the conclusion of the novel comes about everything fits into place.When I first started reading this novel I was blown away by the amount of characters that I was following. The novel started off following four different people all with different story lines. I was unsure of exactly how I liked that but, I believe that it really worked out. I also wasn't happy with the amount of jumping around between stories. It seemed that every new chapter (which consists of about three pages on my kindle) we were headed to a different person. I was left wondering how anything was really going to advance with the amount of jumping around. It soon became apparent that all of the jumping around led to one story line.I really liked the book and once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I loved the developing story line and never knowing what was going to happen next. I always had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, I was never able to get it partly right (i.e. killer is found, starts running, gets caught, dies. When in reality killer is caught, runs away, starts to change, gets in a tight spot, almost makes it out, gets killed and yet gets away at the same time).I didn't like all of the jumping around. I never felt like I got to know the characters in the beginning of the book. By the end of the book I had a good knowledge on the characters but I was lacking some form of attachment to a individual character. I also didn't like how none of the characters really developed through the story. Carson was Carson from beginning to end, Michael was Michael from beginning to end etc. The only one who really changed throughout the book had such a small part in the actual story line that the change was easily overlooked.Overall the story line was amazing and fast paced. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and especially anyone who likes mysteries where they are drawn to a mystery and then the end comes and the reader is like 'What just happened, I'm blown away'."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Koontz's Frankenstein character is extremely interesting and the story was fast paced and had edge of your seat thrills. The exploration of the Victor Frankenstein character was the most compelling, offering readers a glimpse into the insanity it took to create the monster in the first place. Readers of both Koontz and the original would love this interpretation."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Was looking for the Frankenstein series. I found the first three books. they were brand new and arrived in good time."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This book is worth reading just to get to the next book, if nothing else, but is solid in its own right as well. The book is an original take on the Frankenstein story, meshing it with good old creepy horror as Koontz loves to deliver. You'll come to love the two main characters as the trilogy progresses, and they're introduced well here.However, it's not as strong as part 2, for a couple of reasons.First, much of the dialogue early in the novel is forced and awkward. This may have been a result of Koontz trying to introduce relationships and character traits too quickly. One example occurs early in the book when Koontz is trying to show how \\"hard\\" the main character is by the fact that she speaks the lingo of the tough guys on the street. It's so forced, it's just embarrassing and awkward. Another example is when the relationship between two of the main characters is first introduced. Koontz describes it with something along the lines of \\"She knew from the yearning in his eyes that he wanted more than just the doughnut.\\" I couldn't decide what that line reminded me of more: a teenage writer who doesn't know how to subtly introduce a tense/unrequited love story, or a comedy writer making fun of grocery store romance novels. I appreciate that Koontz is using \\"show don't tell\\" and trying to introduce a relationship with something more than just \\"He liked her a lot,\\" but this wasn't a winning solution.Second, the end of the book didn't resolve much of the story, mainly serving as a lead-in to Book 2. Even in a pre-planned series, I prefer some resolution, at least to subplots, in order to make each individual book feel less like a chapter and more like, well, a book. The \\"to be continued\\" ending here is just weak."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"If you have read a Koontz before, you will pretty much already know the story line to this tale. The only difference is that here Koontz takes in Frankenstein and turns him into a Marvel Comic book character out to save the day.I think that I have read just about every Koontz book. He has a plot that he uses over and over again shifting characters and situations just slightly in order to write something new, but it's really not often new. The reason that I read or listen to Koontz is that every once and a while he almost produces an astounding book. Back in the early 1990's it seems to me that he wrote two or three tales of horror that was really engrossing. But since then he has written close to 20 books that are just goofy. They are silly in that they go so over the top with a bad guy who is so purely evil pitted against a couple that is falling in love and as pure as can be. And the ending always is a lesson in Christian morality that makes you wants to call up the author and offer some editorial advice. The only difference with Frankenstein as opposed to most of Koontz earlier work is that this one is three times more complex and three times as long. I have not read the last two books in the series yet, but I hope that they don't become three times as sappy.Koontz has the ability to write a great novel. His imagination and ability to push a story along are not in question. What is in question in my opinion is his need for pat resolutions. At the outset of this newest book, he talks of meeting with Phillip K Dick, an author who inspired many a twilight zone episode in the 60's. Dick's stories were strange and odd tales that harbor a mood I think Koontz strives for in his work. I wish that Koontz would pick up a few of Dick's books and see that if his happy endings were applied to them, they would fall apart, just as Koontz's do. I wish that Koontz's main characters were either more flawed if on the good side or less evil if on the bad. At times when you are reading one of Koontz's books, you feel very much like you are in the middle of one of the better X-file episodes and wonder why Koontz doesn't grab a hold of these moments and expound.(...)"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"From crossword puzzles to sugar pecans, Koontz creates, and triumphs! I got the book because it was just a regular paperback, planning on reading it much later in the year than now. But when you hear all the hype about this, for once just believe it and find out for yourself! Approach with caution, it'll grip you from the first page! Then the nouns, verbs, adjectives, all that good stuff just falls into place. The excitement Koontz serves up is very electrifying in more than one way! OK!Join EVERYBODY from Deucalion, the tattooed man, Carson O'Connor, the NO-FEAR detective, her partner, the arrogant, yet somewhat laid back, Michael Maddison. How long has Deucalion been dealing with his situation? What is his purpose? Maybe ask yourself how long this dude's actually been around for! You'll find out.At the same time, drink in the anxiety of Randall Six, with his crossword puzzles and daily routine. Yet stagger with fear while you observe Dr. Victor Helios. What kind of a man is the good doctor? Hey, is he a good doctor? How long must one endure? Enjoy the human side of all sides of this creation! Koontz quotes the great C.S. Lewis to prepare us, yet humbles even the likes of one Mary Shelley. Have I read Shelley's version? Nope? Am I likely to? Probably not. I think if Koontz were to hear that this isn't like Shelley's original, he'd probably be the first to say thank you. It wasn't meant to be.As usual with Koontz, expect the unexpected! Be pleased with as surprises arise, yet let your heart share in small bits of sorrow. But don't be surprised if you steal a few laughs as you bite off that last fingernail! We don't know what will happen next, but I do know this. I can't wait for more! The question is, do you dare take the risk of this first book?"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I am a big fan of Dean Koontz but not this book. The character Decaulion was boring. I didn't think much of the ending (I don't want to give it away). Usually I'm surprised by the ending, or satisfied. A predictable conclusion."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Well actually, no. Of course not. Nothing can top the original. But Koontz comes at this classic tale with his own scythe ready to cause a change of faith in the fans of the original. This is not so much a remake as a supplement to the classic tale. Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Any newcomers who have not read Dean Koontz this is a great 1st book. At first, I had no intention of reading a book about Frankenstein. The topic is so old and I can't begin to count how many tv/movies I've seen on the guy. I figured there is no way Dean can come up with something new and original. I was mistaken. Deucalion is an unlikely hero to the human race. Koontz revives Frankenstein with a refreshing new take and brings him into our century."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This is only the second book from Koontz that I've read, and since this one introduces his Frankenstein series, it certainly won't be the last. I finished it in record time for me - just 7 days. It's a fast page turner thanks to its short chapters, lots of dialogue, and lack of detail. Sure, it may not hold much literary merit or be an engrossing read that really makes you think, but it still holds a certain amount of entertainment value that I liked.Victor Frankenstein, now known as Victor Helios, has survived the last 200 years since Mary Shelley first wrote about him. He's rich and living in New Orleans, and he has perfected his ability to create life. He is creating a New Race to live upon us and eventually wipe out the \\"Old Race.\\" His new creations have two hearts, no scars, and lack the ability to feel certain emotions such as the urge to kill or harm themselves. They also lack the need for love. Sexual gratification, achieved by having sex with any member of the New Race because they lack the needs for attraction, only brings them self satisfaction and they are all sterile.To Victor, they are the perfect humans and he will conquer the world with them. He's even on his fourth wife, Erika, who is the perfect servant. But Erika loves to read and begins to question Victor's motives. She wonders why he collects fine art - all created by humans - if he hates the Old Race so much. And Victor's first creation - the monster - is also still alive. While Victor has become the monster, his first monster has become more human. He now goes by the name of Deucalion and he comes to New Orleans to find Victor and discover what he has been doing.However, a serial killer is upon them - killing both Old and New Race members and collecting body parts. Young detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison are on the case. They are quick-witted and smart, and they are also attracted to each other. Carson's brother, Arnie, suffers from autism and spends his time building an elaborate castle from Legos.Victor has also created a New Race Member known as Randal Six, who also has qualities of an autistic child. Randal is determined to escape from Victor's lab, Hands of Mercy, to find Arnie and discover what brings him happiness. Meanwhile, O'Connor and Maddison team up with Deucalion to track down the killer and to get one step closer to Victor.These are pretty much the story lines that make up the first book in the series. The detectives chasing down the killer is actually probably the weakest of the lot. Their sarcastic humor and loving looks at each other are pretty dry, and their steps through the case are somewhat predictable. When the identity of the killer is revealed, it's not much of a surprise, but at least the reader gets to find out who it is before the detectives do.While you'd think that Deucalion would have a primary part in the first book, he doesn't. He spends over half of the book in an old movie theater - doing no investigation of his own to find Victor. It's not until he teams up with the detectives in the last 200 pages that we really see him step out and begin to move around. The best parts are Ericka, Victor's wife, being tormented by what she believes to be a rat. The more time she spends at home with herself and her books - she loves Emily Dickinson and becomes a metaphor for one of her poems - the more she begins to question humanity and what Victor really is. Randal Six's attempt to escape the lab, via spelling out crosswords on the tiles in the floor, is also a nicely paced tale. We want to see him escape. We connect with him as a character because of his condition.There's also lots of intense scenes and good writing involving the subjects of creation and God and mortality - science vs. religion. Koontz definitely has several underlying messages here to make you think, which really make this an intriguing read overall as Victor's New Race members struggle. They aren't supposed to question their existence or feel the need for religion. He has purposely denied them such feelings, but sometimes even immortal humans begin to question and when they do, their fragile balance is thrown off. It is these inner conflicts that really give this book life, overshadowed with a killer on the loose.Like I said, its the minor characters that I really connected with here and who stole the show. Was it enough to keep me reading? Absolutely. I plan to move forward with Book Two right away."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I was given Frankenstein: Prodigal Son: A Novel (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein) by a person who purchased it at a used bookstore for $2. I certainly wouldn't recommend paying any more than that for this book. It is typical Koontz's more recent recipe novels...Corny wisecracking male protagonist, stunning female protagonist (insipid romantic tension between the two), purely evil antagonist, enigmatic main, yet oddly tertiary, miracle character and the setup character for the second book. The plot is ridiculously unimaginative and the obvious attempt to stretch a thin story line out over several books I found particularly irksome. I do realize that this was originally intended to be a television series, but I feel the novels should be able to stand on their own -- or bill it as a serial novelization, which is what it is and what I tend to avoid. 97 chapters in less than 500 pages....Hmmmm.... It reads like one of those television shows that is geared toward teens with the attention span of gnats, with many chapters being only three pages long. If you count all the empty space on the pages from chapter headers, you will soon realize that you're actually only reading a 300 page book. The format makes it a quick read and I was able to finish it in a couple hours and move on to better things. I won't be hooked into buying the other books in the series, too much fluff."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This forum is for your opinion of the book, not for each of you to explain the plot over and over again. That's already done above."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"This is the first of a three part trilogy imagining that Mary Shelly based her classic Frankenstein novel upon facts, but got the facts wrong. Dr. Frankenstein and the monster he created are still alive after two hundred years. The doctor is still performing evil acts while his monster is trying to do good.Koontz is an excellent writer. His books, like this one, frequently mix the supernatural with the natural, and the later might be, as it is here, a criminal case. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is calling himself Victor Helios, an irony, as if he is bringing the sun to earth. Although well over two hundred years old, he looks fit and in his thirties. He is extremely rich and has been accepted in the level of society. He has been making more than a thousand new race people, with two heart, who have no emotions, who if hurt heal within seconds, and has integrated them into all parts of society, including the police and clergy. His goal is to replace the old human race with his new race, beings that will do his bidding. Yet, despite two hundred years of practice and constant improvements, the new race beings have problems, especially their inability to feel happy.Helios created for himself a female, more beautiful than a human female, who does whatever he wills. But she slurps her soup, reads poetry, and aggravates her creator. She is Erica IV. The prior Ericas also failed to satisfy Helios completely.Helios does not know that the first monster he created is still alive. He calls himself Deucalion, after the son of Prometheus in the ancient Greek myth. Prometheus was the being who, according to some versions of the myth, created people and gave them fire. While Zeus was bad, Prometheus was good. Deucalion is living in a monastery. When he hears that Dr. Frankenstein/Helios is still alive, he leaves the monastery and comes to New Orleans seeking a way to stop Frankenstein. But he has a problem. Frankenstein engineered him and his other creations to obey him and never harm him. He needs help to defeat the doctor.There are two serial killers loose in New Orleans.

Is O'Connor's brother in trouble?"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I read books One and Two of this series and at the end of each, I thought, he can't possibly write his way out of this. In the first two books, Koontz edged the tension and the plot up to dizzying heights. It seemed that the third book would have to end in an wildly dramatic climax with the clones deconstructing rapidly and the antagonists trapped in a circumstance that they couldn't fight their way out of. And then....nothing. The third book simply couldn't resolve all the issues raised in the first two. Deucalion suddenly has magical power to violate the laws of physics. The malignant growth from Harker is a mentally challenged E.T. And Helios meets his end in a pile of garbage. I had a really horrid feeling as the book ended, that the clones gathered around a bonfire and sang the Ewok victory song from \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"I should have listened to my gut and realized early on in the book that the reason it took so long for Koonts to finish this one was because he knew he had written himself into a corner and there was no way out. My reading group was scheduled to read this for September. With any luck, we'll just call the whole thing off."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I love Koontz' work.

Anderson is going to fairly or unfairly gain some kudos and credit for this story's crispness. I commented to any that would listen that although I am a fairly large Koontz fan I found the latter offerings I have read by him to be overly verbiose. I thought while reading BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON for example \\"Ok Mr. Koontz we realize you enjoy and have fine grasp of English language I see no need for every second paragraph to me metaphorical, or other wordplay\\". However in this novel the writing is sharp and succinct, doing an admirable job of being clever yet seamlessly interweaving and sewing a huge tapestry of plots and sub-plots into one very compelling suspenseful tale. So yes Koontz gets his lion share of credit for this excellent horror/suspense novel as well perhaps being reminded to return to his roots (before his language got a little flowery) and telling the story he had to tell and readers virtually have to read.Also as in all good multi-part suspense novels this was ended perfectly with a cliff-hanger making me at least eager for the conclussion."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Frankenstein part one delivers all the thrills and chills that you expect from Dean Koontz and it is also a great winter read!

This is probably Koontz's best book in years. Having Kevin J. Anderson's assistance may have something to do with it, but no matter, FRANKENSTEIN: PRODIGAL SON is great. Taking the well known legendary characters created by Mary Shelley, Koontz/Anderson weave a hypnotic and frightening tale of monsters and madmen. Although a lot of Koontz's tiring flouresncent descriptions are still present, the book captures the spell of New Orleans and gives us many characters to either applaud or boo. Koontz's favorite formula of having a male and female confront unknown terrors returns in glorious fashion in Carson and Michael, the two detectives seeking a serial killer. This is more of a horror novel than anything Koontz has written in years and he piles on the gore and terror tactics deliciously. If the follow-ups are as good, Koontz has a real career-booster on his hands!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter.

I don't know if it should be taken as a conpliment or criticism of Koontz or Gorman, but I really couldn't tell which parts had been written by Koontz and which by Gorman (or whether Gorman wrote the whole thing, in the style of Koontz).Anyway, it's not Koontz's most original or forceful storytelling, but it passes the page-turning test. It kept me hooked until the end, and had me wanting to read the continuation in the second book.Koontz's FRANKENSTEIN lays bare, to a heightened extent, many of the faults and virtues of Koontz's writing in general. The novel is extremely readable, but it suffers from a patness of character and plotting. It's a good book, but not a great one.Still, a good book's a good book."},{"Title":"Prodigal Son (Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book 1)","review":"I love Dean Koontz. This was not my favorite.

Zombies, Werewolves, Witches and Vampires currently in books and movies have left this franchise in the dust and has been in much need for revamping. I believe Koontz could be on to something here and something fresh for personally my favorite classic horror character and story of all time. Sexy, mystical, philosophical, humorous and modern, it dramatically expands on my favorite character and story in spectacular fashion. The science in the fiction in this series is insightful and informative. Victor Frankenstein's narratives are incredible as you see the \\"good doctor\\" in an evil new Unitarian light .

I read many aviation related books and magazines. I don't often read books that contain a lot of poetry, which AIR FARE does.(It also has short stories and excerpts from longer works.) So to say I was pleasantly surprised by this little wonder of a book is an understatement.My advice? If you've never flown but wonder what it's like, you should read this book. If you have flown as a passenger, you'll recognize your own emotions, both good and bad, in every page. If you are a pilot, you'll see yourself reflected in myriad indelible images; you'll be drawn back by memory to a hundred different experiences; and you'll want to read-and reread-each and every privileged glimpse into the human heart of flight, and be left wanting more.

Whereas researchers, psychologists and society in general go to great lengths to study, understand and help those who dwell a long way below the mean intellect, those living their lives an equal distance the opposite side of the mean often find themselves living in a void of confusion, misunderstanding-- and misinformation. Their lives are perhaps complicated by a &quot;split personality&quot; support system that provides tools and special programs to gifted children, but then vanishes into thin air once the gifted individual is deemed &quot;Adult&quot;-- in some cases providing an abrupt perception change from giftedness as having positive &quot;value&quot; to suddenly being a reason for discrimination and sneers.Gifted Adults are &quot;statistical outliers.&quot; As such, they often have special issues, living in a world whose actions are centered around accommodating the &quot;norm.&quot; At best, a Gifted Adult seeking to have his/her needs understood, may hear the words &quot;Well, we're ALL gifted, in our own special way.&quot; At worst (and more frequently) they will hear &quot;How can you have problems, if you're so smart?&quot;-- words that reflect a popular view that giftedness is a &quot;privilege&quot; that exempts a person from having any difficulties in life. Yet, Gifted Adults discover that working harder, seeking answers, seeing therapists and trying to contribute often leaves them with a sense of &quot;emptiness&quot; and lack of fulfillment.Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's book is a much-needed tool to help gifted adults understand themselves, and accept the fact that their brains work a little bit differently. Real differences, I might add, that change the way a gifted person views their interactions with the world, their road to self-actualization, or considerations for seeking therapy.In Part I of the book, Jacobsen starts to define her own view of giftedness, and addresses some of the Societal Myths (Giftedness = High IQ), and influences (Gifted adults' tendency to deny their giftedness) established by conventional thinking.In Part II, she presents her alternative theory for measuring giftedness-- a broad system she has named &quot;Evolutionary Intelligence&quot; (or EvIQ). Although Jacobsen &quot;borrows&quot; heavily from the &quot;Multiple Intelligences&quot; theory originally set forth by Howard Gardner at Harvard, she adds a number of new facets, presented in a 240-item &quot;self quiz&quot; in Chapter 7 of the book. Unlike &quot;standard&quot; IQ tests, this is NOT a timed exercise with &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; answers, but rather a self-evaluation. Of course, honest self-scrutiny is central to obtaining a &quot;valid&quot; result-- which may present difficulty for some.Part III explores most of the common &quot;misunderstandings&quot; gifted adults encounter in their interactions with daily life. Topics include &quot;self mis-diagnoses;&quot; the issues associated with &quot;Failing to Fit In;&quot; rewriting personal history and past events through understanding &quot;common criticisms&quot; often heard by gifted adults (&quot;Can't you just stick with ONE thing?&quot; &quot;Where do you get those wild ideas?&quot; &quot;Can't you just slow down?&quot;); the &quot;False Self&quot; and dumbing yourself down; as well as the &quot;Impostor Syndrome&quot; gifted adults often experience.Parts IV and V offer a series of tools and possible solutions to help gifted adults reorient their energies in an effort to create lives that let them be &quot;true to themselves&quot;-- while still fitting into the &quot;normalcy&quot; of their surroundings. In part IV, Jacobsen explores both career issues and personal relationships, however, I found this section to be a bit general and &quot;pep-talkish.&quot; The final section deals with summarizing and then applying the lessons learned in the book.Observations: My general inclination is to say &quot; Buy this book! Buy it NOW! Read it! Learn!&quot;However, the potential reader should understand just what the book will do for them. &quot;The Gifted Adult&quot; (Formerly published under the name &quot;Liberating Everyday Genius&quot;-- the name change is a GOOD idea!) is long on presenting Jacobsen's theory of Evolutionary Intelligence, and long on providing self-understanding for the gifted adult-- but somewhat short as a &quot;How-To&quot; guidebook on how to live life. If you're looking for &quot;connect A to B&quot; solutions, you'll find only a limited number here.The author is also quite &quot;liberal&quot; with her use of the designation &quot;gifted.&quot; Normally, the term is used to describe approximately 2% of the population. Jacobsen's definition may include as many as 10%-- and whether this is merely a technique to sell more books, or a figure backed by scientific research, I do not know. It doesn't detract materially from the value of the information presented-- but at times the writing does become a little bit &quot;fluffy&quot; and lacking in focus.Some personal thoughts (Caveats): Society is engaged in a long-term love affair with the idea of &quot;pathologizing&quot; any behavior not tightly clustered around a narrow definition of &quot;Normal.&quot; Incorrectly diagnosing and medicating giftedness as ADHD or Bipolar Disorder responds to a popular need for &quot;A Quick And Easy Fix.&quot; If AT ALL possible, we want a &quot;magic pill&quot; rather than &quot;hard work.&quot; And whereas disorders certainly DO occur, Adult Giftedness-- and the psychological makeup specific to it-- is NOT a pathology.Overall rating: Outstanding (9.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the gifted adult and anyone living with a gifted adult, but the book also should be required reading for any psychologist/therapist who's been asked if they are &quot;familiar with the psychology of Adult Giftedness.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"In general, I found this book very enlightening. I differ in one respect from most of the &quot;everyday geniuses&quot; the author describes: early in life I was identified as having a high IQ. But my parents and teachers suffered from the misconception that this was an isolated trait and, in all other respects, I was a completely normal child. It was fine with them that I learned quickly, but the qualities that they found less agreeable (my determination, enthusiasm, sensitivity, and immensely wide variety of interests) were redefined as negatives: I was &quot;stubborn,&quot; &quot;unfocused,&quot; &quot;hasty,&quot; &quot;too emotional,&quot; and so on. Plus the ideals that I was supposed to achieve -- get straight A's in school, be quiet and well-behaved, specify a career goal and pursue it -- didn't appeal to me in the least; I didn't want an ordinary life, I wanted an extraordinary one. But I grew up believing that, by refusing to squeeze myself into the slots that society provided, I was &quot;failing to live up to my potential.&quot;It wasn't until recently that I learned that there's more to giftedness than a high IQ or a talent in a particular area. Palladino's &quot;Dreamers, Discoverers, and Dynamos,&quot; Gardner's work on &quot;multiple intelligences,&quot; and many other books point out that the gifted child's mind actually works differently: intensity, drive, and sensitivity are all part of the package (which Palladino characterizes as &quot;divergent thinking&quot;). But the dividing line between genius and ADD is a blurry one, and our educational system's emphasis on normality and conformity often leads to defining any &quot;divergence&quot; as pathological or, at best, as misbehavior.This book is a great antidote to such thinking. The author gives a self-test that enables the &quot;everyday genius&quot; to identify his/her strengths and personality traits, and I found the results interesting. Also very helpful are the lengthy sections on redefining your supposed negatives as positives: you're not someone who needs to &quot;slow down&quot;; doing things quickly is normal for you. I was greatly reassured to discover that my burning desire to &quot;make a difference in the world&quot; didn't stem from arrogance (which more than one teacher had scolded me for), but was, rather, a typical part of the high-EvI package. Although I don't agree with all of the author's suggestions in the &quot;self-help&quot; chapters, I think she's making an important point: the &quot;everyday genius&quot; can live and work effectively in the world not by suppressing his/her strengths, but by practicing self-discipline to use these strengths in the service of a higher goal. Given the scarcity of books written specifically for gifted adults (rather than children), this book fills a great need, and does it well.I have only one quibble with the book, but it caused me to rate it with four stars rather than five. The author says things like &quot;studies have shown ...&quot;, but she almost never gives the references for these studies; the footnotes to the chapters rarely mention research at all. I realize that she's writing a &quot;popular&quot; book rather than a scholarly work, and that many of her conclusions are based on her experience with her clients rather than on scientific research. But I feel it would give her conclusions far more credibility if she backed them up with harder data."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"This is a review of the book \\"Liberating Everday Genius\\" by Jacobsen; I'm not sure if this book is the same under another name or if this new book offers more than the older version previously published.I read this book in hopes that it would actually teach me how to liberate my creativity and intelligence. Unfortunately, most of what it offers is mere information and theory regarding what \\"everyday genius\\" is and how to tell if you are one using a rather generic \\"test.\\" It then goes on to dispel myths and stereotypes that most \\"geniuses\\" seem to experience. I know that I found a lot of myself in this book although I'm not sure I'd call myself a genius. Perhaps I overestimate what the term really means, thus fitting in to the descriptions she gives of how society pushes down anyone who thinks differently than the majority. Sadly, none of my big questions were answered such as, \\"how do I overcome this programming?\\" I am just as confused and feel just as alone as I did prior to reading the book, so I can't say it has been any help to me except to point out that maybe there are others out there like me. What's the point if I still feel too lost to find them and to express my \\"true\\" self? Much of the material is repetitive in that she presents the same ideas and concepts over and over again. I assume she's trying to drill it into the head of the reader, but perhaps it's just book filler. I think she could have compacted the material into a book half the original size, thus lowering the price in the process. If you buy it, expect to be reading a Tony Robbins type self-esteem booster...do not expect to find real answers."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"For someone who's gifted, Jacobsen's book can bring a sigh of relief and recognition. &quot;I'm not an ugly duckling after all! I was meant to be a swan.&quot;While some reviewers criticize this book as &quot;elitist,&quot; I find the opposite. Jacobsen doesn't suggest that anyone be exempt from social norms or rules. To the contrary, she shows that the gifted may face a tougher challenge than the less-gifted: they must learn to accommodate to a society as an invisible often-resented minority group. It's up to each gifted person -- hopefully aided by mentors who can take advantage of &quot;teaching moments&quot; -- to learn to swim. That means adjusting a blunt style of speaking, communicating in a new style and, always, dealing with the loneliness of being &quot;different.&quot; Gifted people tend to attract envy, not empathy, and they don't always grow into rich and successful adults. Indeed, without recognition early in life, the gifted can become severely depressed, mainly due to isolation.Once you read this book, it's easy to recognize evidence of giftedness in yourself and others, including autobiographical accounts. A combination of characteristics -- sensitivity, high-speed, high-energy -- can appear frustrating to those who don't realize what's going on. Many gifted children get diagnosed as hyperactive, depressed, socially inept and worse.I'm not overfond of pencil-and-paper tests, but Jacobsen offers ways to identify specific areas of giftedness through some simple questions. Readers can ignore this part if they choose.Counselors, career coaches, therapists, managers, guidance professionals -- all should have this book on their shelves. When they find themselves getting overwhelmed by a gifted client, they need to know what's going on."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"Throughout most of my 50 years of life, I have felt out of place. Like an alien being dropped upon this earth, I use a different vocabulary, have unusual bursts of energy, have a mind that travels at light speed, am highly reactive to external stimulus, and even sleep in a different pattern than most people. The labels given me are endless: too emotional, over-reacting, moody, anxiety disorder... even bipolar with hysterical mania, but without depression (the newest and my favorite!).This book gave me great peace. I understand myself better now. With an IQ of 150 and a life-long creative (writer and artist), I am normal for me... and, there are others like me out there!Those who are not &quot;gifted,&quot; do not comprehend the lonliness or the anguish experienced by this misunderstood minority. I invite everyone to read this book, to gain insight into themselves, into loved ones, and/or into the world of the gifted.Let us celebrate who we are, and the contributions we can give to society."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"Mary-Elaine Jacobsen brings the largely invisible plights and possibilities of the gifted adult to our attention. As an intense, complex and driven gifted adult, myself, I truly appreciate her contribution to my life and the lives of others I know who've read the book. As a therapist to gifted adults for many years, Jacobsen knows what she's talking about and gives us many moving stories to find ourselves, our friends or our parents in. I cried many tears reading this book, remembering experiences in my own life and seeing them in a more self-compassionate light.I've known I was smart, intense and driven but Jacobsen helped me to see why and what to do about it to have a happier, more fulfilled life. I'm probably writing this review right now because of the influence of this book. I've always craved to get my ideas out in the world and here on the Net and in my blog (tokerud's technology treats) I've sought out ways to do that. Jacobsen gives the gifted adult the good news and the bad news. The good news is great. I can forgive myself. The bad news is, that the only way things are going to change is for me to change some bad habits and be constructive and persistent in the world and express my gifts. If you know you are intense and driven and probably pretty smart, pick this book up. It could change YOUR life too.This book is a well-written but occasionally dense read. However, it will be a page-turner for a gifted adult. And, for that matter, gifted adults tend to like dense books. One of the unfortunate facts that Jacobsen points out is that gifted adults have usually learned to keep a low profile about their giftedness. They've learned to cover it up and at a certain point in their lives, many gifted adults forget they are gifted. It is a convenient but, ultimately, very harmful defense mechanism. That's why I said earlier that if you merely suspect you might possibly be a gifted adult, read this book! It will shake you out of your unconsciousness and get you back on the track of getting your gifts out into the world where they belong!"},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"I had to laugh at the editorial review, which accuses Dr. Jacobsen of being \\"elitist,\\" one of the many criticisms that gifted people receive. Maybe that reviewer should have read the book more carefully. This is a terrific book that will help people realize their potential. That's a good thing for the world and should not be discouraged or belittled.If you have struggled with fitting in only to feel like you cannot be your authentic self, this book will help you discover why. I also recommend \\"Dark Side of the Light Chasers\\" and other books by Debbie Ford to help you discover the damage done by all those messages to play small, and begin to heal, giving yourself permission to be BIG."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"I give this book three stars because everything the author says is right on the money. I did not give it 5 stars because the book is repetitious and the language rambling. I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I had trouble finishing it. I would have liked less preaching about liberating yourself and more insights on how to do it from examples of people who have done it. There are examples, but not as many as I would have liked, and not described in enough depth.I gained more insights from &quot;Gifted Grownups&quot; by Marylou Kelly Streznewski. Her section about the physiology of giftedness, in particular, covered material I have not seen anywhere else.In the end, how much you enjoy this book will depend much on how comfortable you are with your giftedness. If you have not become comfortable with being &quot;different&quot;, you will probably value this book. If you are comfortable with the real gifted you, this is probably not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"Imagine you owned a Ferrari Testarossa. Imagine that your Ferrari is the only car you will ever have. Now imagine that your Ferrari not only sets land speed records and wins road rallies, but has to be a daily commuter car, carry loads like a pick-up, handle deep snow like a SUV, and be the car that your kids learn to drive on. Now add to the mix that you *expect* your Ferrari to have the insurance rates, gas mileage, and maintenance requirements of the Honda Accords that everyone else has. Now imagine that you truly think your Ferrari is a Honda, and you're deeply, fundamentally distressed that it gives you so much pleasure but so many problems.Welcome to reality as experienced by the Gifted.The insights provided by the book were nothing less than a series of epiphanies for me. The author not only provides information around the fact that Giftedness has little correlation with high IQ, she also details the discrete set of personality characteristics typical of the Gifted, with a clear listing of the pitfalls and benefits derived from those characteristics. She explains how those &quot;quirks&quot; demand that Gifted people care for themselves in very different ways. She then goes on to dispel any myth that a Gifted person may have that they are &quot;better&quot; than non-Gifted people, while simultaneously providing encouragement to and insight into getting beyond the difficulties attendant with being a Ferrari in a Honda world.If you are Gifted, work with,live with or love one, *please* read this book. It will make all your lives a lot easier. (And we're not quite as rare as you'd think!)"},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"This book was a disappointment. Jacobsen spends the majority of this book verbosely reassuring the insecure reader that he or she (somehow, I get the distinct impression that Jacobsen assumes the reader to be probably female rather than male) is indeed a precious flower. Well, I don't need to be told I'm a precious flower. I know that already. What I need to know is where I can find ground to plant myself in where I won't wither and die. Unfortunately, Jacobsen is long on reassurance but short on practical advice. This book contains several useful self-diagnostic tools, which aid in developing greater self-awareness, but the reader is left to figure out what to do with that information. I felt most keenly the lack of even the most basic advice on how to identify one's \\"Mandated Mission.\\" Great phrase. Great concept. I can FEEL exactly what she's talking about. But I don't know what my Mandated Mission IS or how to go about identifying it, and she doesn't explain.The subtitle promises \\"A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius.\\" That is not what this book is. It's not revolutionary, only exhortatory. It offers hope of liberation, but it doesn't actually provide any. \\"The Gifted Adult\\" needs two things: a less indulgent editor and a more pragmatic follow-up."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"In an article in Advanced Development journal, Mary-Elaine Jacobsen noted the typical stereotypes of gifted people include the \\"temperamental artist, or the pathetic isolate whose brainy abilities are lost in foolishness, alcoholism or chronic depression,\\" and the glittering superstar in the arts or sciences with talents elevating them [more or less effortlessly] to \\"an unreachable pedestal of human achievement.\\"One of the great values of her book is in showing how more ordinary people with exceptional abilities and sensitivities face challenges in, first of all, recognizing themselves, then realizing their multiple talents.All too often, gifted adults [and children] get labeled as being problematical or pathological. Her book helps to better understand a range of gifted personality traits that can be embraced and used for living a more authentic and fulfilling life."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"I agree with the other reviews in that this book is an eye opener if you are not already aware of the 'new' research into giftedness. I would like to make two comments though.First, as one reviewer puts it, the book is lavish on the description of the gifted' characteristics and the difficulties that they encounter in their lives, but is lacking in now-what-do-I do. This is not exactly true. There are many pieces of advice that the author gives on how you can manage those traits that make it so difficult to fit in. However, it takes time for what you've read to sink in. For example, suppose that your social life has not been that great lately and you start feeling depressed. Looking back in time at similar situations, you'd probably decide that you need to make more friends or even find a partner. However, that may not really be the case. It could be that, as the author has so written, you have not been entertaining that necessity of the gifted to have a continual indulging in some kind of interest or passion. As the author puts it, the gifted have \`multiple interests' and must always be involved in some kind of pursuit or another. Whenever you feel the blues, turn to the book, look hard and you'd probably find what you're looking for. Most likely, the advice contained in the book can be condensed to fit on just one page; but every single advice is priceless if you take a pause and give it the consideration and time of thought that it needs in order to be effective and long-lasting. The problem is that the book can never substitute for therapy and trying to use it as a manual or workbook is just extremely hard work as is the case with any book anyway. You'd have to be a professional yourself.My second comment is that I find interesting analogies between the Lion sign of western astrology, the Dragon sign of Chinese astrology and the gifted' description. I'd say that these characteristics have been observed throughout the ages and there's nothing really new under the sun except that these traits are now being studied using the 'modern' tools of human psychology.Last, I'd like to say that since it feels very awkward to call yourself gifted, how about \`smd' , sensitivity more developed, since the term \`hsp' has already been coined. I'd say that the gifted are most different from others in their sensitivity. Like the French say, these people have \`une sensibilit&eacute; &agrave; fleur de peau'. To be a \`smd' is a way of life and, alas, a constant struggle."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"I found this book very helpful in learning to understand my creativity/ idealism and drivenness, that these things are normal for about 8% of the population and I am not alone or wierd, just gifted.

Worth every cent!"},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"Read this book as soon as possible. It is so jam filled (malaprop intended) with wisdom and knowledge and so well written with passion and power. Give a copy to each of your teenage children, nieces and nephews! They need this stuff at as young an age as possible.And once you've read it, you must readYour Own Worst Enemy: Breaking the Habit of Adult Underachievementwhich gets down to the nitty gritty of breaking the bad habits that gifted people edge into because of their own gifted pride."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"This is definitely best of (not many) books for gifted adults (of books not focused only on gifted children). Absolutely informative, describing everything from stories to theory and personality traits behind giftedness. There is no other book at the same level of information and help for gifted adults. I agree with other reviews - if you expect this book will give you ultimate answers and ready-made solutions to adapt to your life, you will be disappointed. It is better to expect this book to be interesting inquiry into the soul of gifted people, with several ideas what to do and what to change in your lifestyle, however you will stay alone with final decisions and this book can be inspiration for creating more ideas for changing your lifestyle. Chapters of practical help (managing gifted adult life) are not the strongest point of the book. Generally they advise you - do not be either too extreme, or too inhibited in showing up your traits. Learn to balance your self- expression. No more ideas... However you (as probably gifted adult) do not expect one book with all solutions to your life, do you? This book is definitely a must for everybody who is lost, is trying to orient, or trying to get more information about giftedness in adult people. Week points - 1) It is sometimes too repetitive and wordy, 2) Concepts like \\"Evolutionary Intelligence\\" or \\"Everyday genius\\" are useless, confusing and presented probably with understandable intention of the author to suggest new theory, however these concepts are not elaborated well and sound too \\"new age\\". Up-to-date psychological terminology would be sufficient. Still, five stars are absolutely fair for this book."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"I loved this book. It's not just kids who can have the odd, creative, surprising characteristics of 'gifted'...What do we think Gifted Kids grow up into? Normal adults? Not by a longshot!Do you ever feel like an outsider, wondering 'Why don't I see the world the way my peers do?' This book may help you figure out something about yourself. Even if you weren't diagnosed as gifted (Yeah..it could also be called 'Cursed'), your current disconnect with other people may be the product of a quirky \\"gifted\\" mind. If you're married to one of these personalities, this book can help you understand very frustrating traits in a new way.My biggest issue with this book, though, is the term 'Gifted'. The author even addresses this - it carries a connotation of a value judgement, and honestly, when the book outlines the social difficulties and rejections of gifted adults by other personality types, \\"Cursed\\" is just as valid a label. There's nothing better about being Gifted...they're just different. A lovely difference, when harnessed correctly and when a gifted finds their \\"flock\\", but I hesitate to stray from an egalitarian viewpoint on varying human personality types.My second biggest issue is that although the need to connect with other Gifteds is identified, it doesn't give much of a blueprint for Gifteds to find their own kind in the world. Mensa was the only group mentioned that I could see, and that group only applies to a very small subset of the personality types the book. Because the term 'gifted' is greatly disliked by some gifteds, they're not likely to rally around it to find each other.But, this book clearly identifies a set of traits found in certain people, and gives them a name, along with a possible set of approaches to life for coping with this particular way of being. For that, it shines."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"Been confused for so long about who I am, this book truly liberates the blockages that the author has so welled expressed and put in words, I felt a re-newed strength that I was on the right track, but now with less of a fight. Thanks for the support and the insights."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"In a way this book scares me because if I had read this book before I read &quot;Driven to Distraction&quot; by Edward Hallowell, MD and John Ratey, MD (on Attention/Deficit/Hyperactivity/Disorder or ADHD), I would have done a true disservice to my family, especially my very gifted (and very hyperactive daughter) by believing she was just gifted. As it was, in reading this book, I found that the descriptions of the author's &quot;gifted&quot; patients could just as well have been used by the authors of &quot;Distraction&quot; to describe their patients. Additionally, the author's descriptions of the traits of &quot;gifted&quot; adults are essentially the same as those that could be used to describe the very smart hyperactive impulsive individual with ADHD. Only in this book, those same traits are given a positive spin. For example, when her &quot;gifted&quot; adults get into trouble by saying whatever is on their mind (i.e., not editing anything before it comes out), they aren't being impulsive, they are just being &quot;truthful&quot; in a way others don't want to hear. And when their impulsivity leads them to be impatient with others, it is just that everyone else in the world is too slow. All of that being said, the author's specific suggestions for dealing with those traits are helpful. We just need to do more to understand the neuro-chemistry of thing called ADHD or the neuro-chemistry of being &quot;gifted&quot; (a subject there appears to be zero research on, no doubt because &quot;gifted&quot; is terminology developed in the educational field and not the medical field). If the traits the author describes as &quot;gifted&quot; are really just the way those highly intelligent people act when there is a dopamine dis-regulation in their brains (the problem with ADHD), we need to look at this. As the other reviewer said, it is all a matter of which part of the elephant one is looking at -- the author is looking at one part and the ADHD researchers are looking at another. Meanwhile, those labeled &quot;ADHD&quot; are disserved by notions that their traits are all negative and those that are labeled &quot;gifted&quot; are disserved by not understanding the entire picture -- and the possible positive effects of ADHD treatment."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"This is a book for above average people, more like the top 25%. If you made the National Honor Society in High School, or you're just a good person who got B's and does volunteer work, then you are a gifted adult. The author's definition of gifted is broad, and you fit if you've got it together and give something back to your community. Jacobsen really hits 'The Betterment of Mankind' (Mandated Mission) as the primary motive of the gifted, so if you are *already* involved with that, welcome to the gifted club.Part of my problem with the contents of this book is that the writer was a woman, and the content more for women. (That was my impression as a male reader.) Jacobsen assumes part of being gifted is the exercise of empathy. A person can attempt the betterment of mankind by constructing challenges instead of charity. A big part of the book pre-supposes that any humanity-centric course of action is tied to overflowing empathy, and I personally don't agree.I found much of the book devoted to convincing people they were gifted, and once that was done, attempting to convince the gifted that part of the responsibility of being gifted is the betterment of mankind. This was a worthy, noble ideal. Still, somewhere along the line, the author switches more into a visionary 'this-is-how-it-should-be' mode than a simple guide to help the everyday genius realize their potential. Not all of us want to put everything into the 'betterment of mankind', for some of us, it is already our day job.Overall, the book made me feel unworthy to be gifted since I don't devote myself to the 'betterment of mankind' 24-7, and I didn't like that. Still had some helpful perspectives on 'advanced development', but I wish the author had been more flexible regarding personal happiness. I could be perfectly happy without ever chasing a nebulous ideal, and I don't like that following your own 'selfish' dreams are viewed as against much of the 'advanced development' section if they don't achieve the 'betterment of mankind'. Additionally, found it lacking substance; much of the book is cheer-leading (go self-esteem!) without specifics. (Example, p312 on 'rational intuition', \\"Learn to the tell the difference between a hunch, a feeling, and inner guidance.\\" That's it. No advice or instruction on the actual process.... love to take that advice if only I knew how.)This is a book I'd give to a smart person who is unaware they are smart, but not to a real genius. The cover is misleading with the use of 'genius', when it really means 'gifted'. The target audience (75-98 percentile in intelligence) is smart people who know they aren't geniuses and want to better utilize what they have. I don't believe this is well-expressed, and much of the book is helping smart realize they are indeed worthy. If you are already aware of your own gifts, then you may even find the book annoying."},{"Title":"The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)","review":"I finally understand why I've always felt different and like an outcast and I've learned to accept the things about me that are &#34;different.&#34; I never knew so many things I thought were &#34;wrong&#34; with me were commonalities to being gifted.

The things in the book. Was like I talk to the author about it. Myself. I was a child of the late twentith century. For the longest time. I never knew that one of many forgotten of the system they called modern society. The lost of how many minds, how many talents ignored. How many potential discovery unfound. For every gifted person known. There are possible maybe two or three times as many not unkown. It's like putting a child in special educations. And being told he or she is mental tarded. And then told several years later. The child was normal.And he or she could go back regular school. The damage that was to the child. Could very well scar them. In many ways.

I've ordered this book for the second time, to share it with a close friend of mine. Instead of being study literature (like 'How the gifted brain learns', which, for other purposes, is another excellent read - mostly if you are teaching or coaching gifted people), the book is mostly full of 'aha-moments' and reads quite easily. I discovered a kind of trajectory in the book, where I naturally found my 'spot'; so there's three 'parts' regarding past, now and future hidden in the book.The first part is mostly recognizing and reframing the past. It describes cases, including the auther herself at some point, about the process from being full of perceptions about yourself (all the typical elements of gifted people are translated into negative views, mostly how non-gifted people perceive the gifted) until realizing how these elements many of us got to dislike or hate in their lives can be qualities.The second part, including the Evolutionary Intelligence model, contains some tools to get more insight into your personal development needs. This felt for me as the 'now'.Also, the author describes how she got to do work that connects directly to her soul calling, or life mission, or personal passion as you will. A life-changing insight for me, which I found also in other books, is that with the current world-wide crisis it is no wonder that more gifted and talented people are being born. Finding our way, creating coaching and therapy for gifted people (and recognizing all the misdiagnosis going on, because of ADHD and other mental disorders in DSM-IV but no good, 'official' literature on giftedness and its effects) but also transforming our educational systems and training human resource departments at big companies, is essential to help the planet in her process. For me this is the future, I don't feel I have the role that connects exactly to this, but the call is getting stronger. So, since they say 'patience is a virtue', I train myself in taking my time.

If you go look at the reviews on troubled, emotionally unstable, or parenting children with depression/hyperactivity/schizophrenia/borderline personality disorder/ autism, the reviews are much more dissociative (\\"oh, thank god I'm not alone with my troubling child. I knew something was wrong with him, but I never knew what. I'm going to completely ignore all genetic components of these issues, because these are highly stigmatized, as well as environmental issues, because that would somehow imply poor parenting, and just pretend this is an alien baby dropped in my lap.\\")We just love to own things about ourselves and our kids that society thinks are flattering, and shove off those that are disparaging. People are so ridiculous.Even the reviews here are pretentious - everyone is trying to sound like some poor, sad, erudite loner. \\"Oh, I'm just this brilliant person, trapped in a sea of idiocy, and no one knows it. Now I know why I felt so lonely!\\" No - everyone feels lonely and isolated at times, sometimes for long periods of time. It's just part of the human condition - we're gregarious, but distrustful and filled with ego, and our need for approval precludes us from showing our flaws to others whenever possible. We can't be our \\"true\\" selves with most people, so we feel isolated, as though our emotions and flaws are personal only to us, which is a completely ridiculous fallacy, because everyone is doing the same thing. In the words of R. Kelly: We be frontin'.Everyone thinks they're brilliant, or have great taste, or have better judgment than the masses. But, by definition, this isn't true. Most people, by definition, are mediocre. So are we, reviewers. Most people leave no impression on the world, and having a \\"high IQ\\" - which many are so proud of here - is (a) just a quirk of nature (the same genetic trick that made you have a high IQ, if true, could have gone another way and given you a low one. You're closer to stupidity than normalcy. and (b) is not that relevant when it comes to making any positive impact on society, animals, biology, history, or anything else (which is what the pretentious presumably want). High sociability is more important. Oops.Our daughter is very smart, but we always tell her that's her least interesting characteristic. It's like telling her that she's beautiful - it's a genetic boon, and hardly something to boast about. Then what - those who are intelligent and beautiful are better than those who are dumb and ugly? Sounds about right - and incredibly wrong. Her best characteristics are her incredibly generous heart, her readiness to help, to great sense of humor, her ability to pick herself back up after she falls and keep going, and her willingness to laugh at herself.She's a brilliant kid who's going to grow up to be a happy, connected, accepting adult. She'll impact society in some manner - large or very, very tiny - because happiness always does that.

His original writing style transports the reader back to those volcanic days in the blast furnace heat of southern Arizona where the Wobblies of the International Workers of the World (IWW) clashed with the mine owners who in turn were backed by the county sherrif, cowboys, and the Eastern Establishment. Copper was essential to the war effort. The IWW hoped that shutting down the mines would cause a crisis in captialism, halt the war, and spark a revolution; it was all about class warfare. The mine owners feared the end of civilization or as one protagonist in the book puts it, \\"the end of the City of God.\\" The reader witnesses the build-up and explosion through the eyes of characters whose personal lives and fortunes are hinged upon the outcome of the battle.

She had traded the role of the child of emotionally abusive parents, for the role of physical and emotionally abused teen wife. Three and half years into the marriage, tragedy made Peggy Jo seek a different role. Now she's the star of a successful talk show up for national syndication, and a published author of a self-help book that teaches women self-reliance. Unfortunately, someone resents her success and is stalking her. As threatening letters give way to more overt danger, Peggy Jo wisely hires a bodyguard. But with Jack Parker protecting her physical well-being, Peggy Jo best watch her heart.Jack is a lady's man, loving 'em and leaving 'em satisfied. That is, until he meets Peggy Jo. Her caustic tongue and determination mask a vulnerability that he finds incredibly appealing. But Jack's seen the damage a woman can inflict, and has no intention of risking his heart. Despite his caution, however, not only does Peggy Joe slip past his defenses, but so does her delightful young daughter. As he reads fairy tales to the child, and teaches her the magic of Christmas and Santa, Jack finds himself longing for things he thought he'd never want. The trick is going to be keeping Peggy Jo alive long enough to explore the possibilities. With a dangerous psychopath leaving destruction and threats at every turn, Jack's got his hands full.Beverly Barton's JACK'S CHRISTMAS MISSION delightfully blends the season with a tale of intrigue. The magic of Christmas wishes and the lurking danger create a juxtaposition that heightens the senses and keeps the plot moving quickly. Indeed, this carefully plotted tale will hold the reader's attention to the hair-raising finale. With memorable characters that bear scars of the past, a wonderful child, and a matchmaking housekeeper, JACK'S CHRISTMAS MISSION is a keeper. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jack'S Christmas Mission (The Protectors) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"The Man Who Came for Christmas...The last thing Peggy Jo Riley wanted this holiday was a hard-boiled charmer in her house 24/7.

Now Amy Nathan, author of \\"The Young Musician's survival Guide,\\" gives us her latest book which proves we're not alone. \\"Meet the Musicians\\" is an upbeat, informative, up-close-and-personal look at 15 professional musicians all members of the New York Philharmonic. Many of them didn't like to practice when they were kids any more than we did. As adults and accomplished, disciplined musicians they offer excellent practice tips for both parents and children as well as sharing the paths they took to being part of a world class symphony orchestra.Beginning with Carter Brey, Cello and concluding with John Deak, Bass we find photos of these musicians as children, their favorite childhood activities, their educational backgrounds, the inside scoop on particular instruments, how they came to be members of the New York Philharmonic and brief biographical sketches.Young readers will easily relate to these musicians on many different levels.Violist Cynthia Phelps said, \\"When I'm on stage, I think I'm the luckiest person in the world, having such a good time doing what I love to do.\\" She speaks for the musicians represented here, and perhaps for the musicians of tomorrow.Also included in \\"Meet the Musicians\\" is a helpful glossary and list of resources for those who wish to further pursue an interest in music.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Meet the Musicians: From Prodigies (or Not) to Pros","review":"This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration.

The organizational changes in Army Aviation are highlighted, and it is useful to know what organizational structures have been implemented at various times, but the cohesiveness of the story is often sidetracked. It is always a struggle to produce an exhaustive history while explaining how these details relate to the bigger picture, so I sympathize with the author.Unfortunately, it felt as though a large portion of the book was spent slogging through minutiae, and chronological progression was interspersed with thematic progression. I would give the content 4 stars, principally because the applications of aviation in particular engagements was given limited treatment, as were the advances in technology.I think that the best insight that I found in the book was the discussion of the particular difficulties encountered by the Army in providing for equivalent career development for soldiers in Aviation. In this regard, the author recounted the events as a continuing theme, and developed it into a cohesive story.I don't think that I could reconcile the desire to document all of the events covered in this book with a cohesive and engaging story without adding at least 50% to its length, so maybe that is the constraint that prevailed.The readability of the book makes it overall 3 stars in my opinion. As a reference, this book could be useful, but the astounding detail of the book makes the whole volume a giant index, and finding particular discussions requires knowing a priori where to look chronologically and thematically."},{"Title":"A History of Army Aviation: From Its Beginnings to the War on Terror","review":"This book is a must read for ALL Army aviators.

Her clothing is more concerned with comfort and indestructibility rather than fashion or appearance -- much like her approach to life. She realizes that most suitors are more attracted to her looks, her fortune, or entree to her father than to her.Taffy's father asks her to photograph the skeleton of the famous ghost piper of Duntrune, Malcolm MacIntyre. According to legend, Malcolm played the pipes at risk of his own life to warn his clan of impending disaster. His plan worked but in retribution the enemy brutally killed him. Now, on stormy nights, he comes to play his pipes upon the wall. When she touches the piper's bones, a connection is made between Taffy and Malcolm.The span between the centuries that Malcolm and Taffy occupy soon grows thin as each sights an apparition of the other. The echoes of words carry across the centuries until Taffy finds herself drawn into a journey leading her back through the centuries to the ugly wars between clans and the days when the faerie still held sacred space.Melanie Jackson deftly weaves a tale that honors the myth, magic and lore of Scotland. Based on the true story of the piper of Duntrune, she masterfully blends fact with fantasy to present a fast paced, riveting tale. Indeed, this spanning of time and history will capture your imagination in a romance that will touch your heart. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Night Visitor (Timeswept)","review":"Night Visitor was absolutly spellbinding. I picked it up and embarked on a new adventure with an author I had not read as of yet. Not only do I like Melaine Jackson's style of writing, but the characters (Tafeline and Malcolm) were extremly real and very convincing. I loved the story line and the fact that fairies were involved. Kudos to Melanie for making the reader believe that the transition from one time to another was simple but to add a believable fairy story line was great. I would highly recommend this book and am going to buy her other two Iona and Manon tonight!"},{"Title":"Night Visitor (Timeswept)","review":"Ok, I read hundreds of books a year, and in that time frame, there are about 1 to 2 books I just can't finish. Night Visitor is my second one this year (and hopefully my last). There were so many typos and glaring grammatical mistakes (two things I usually read right over) that I just could not get into the story. I got about half way through it, and found that the characters were dull, flat and wholly unrealistic. I tried to suspend my belief because this is a fantasy (fairie story) but nothing I read made me want to continue on.A female photographer from the late 1800's, with a father who doesn't understand her and is patronizing coupled with a Scottish piper that has farie blood (oh yes, let us not forget the diluted fairie blood in our heroine as well!) sets our story. The piper is killed for warning his allies about a trap set. For this, his hands are cut off and he dies (supposedly bad luck for the killers since you are not supposed to kill a piper). His pipes haunt the castle for 200 years until our heroine touches his newly uncovered bones and makes a connection to him. This is the first few chapters and the most interesting part of the story. Our heroine then goes to the past to rescue our hero. Everything else seems to rush past, with little description or depth.I rarely do this, but I suggest you steer clear of Night Visitor, there are better stories out there."},{"Title":"Night Visitor (Timeswept)","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ms. Jackson and am pleasantly surprised. Steeped in Scottish history it is an interesting read to boot. Although I will say that I too was confused by the typo at the beginning of chapter two (it gives the year 1964 instead of 1644). But fortunately, I found through reading the reviews here that it was indeed a typo.Being this was the first book I've read in Scottish history, I felt a bit confused at first, but this only lasts through the first couple of chapters. After Taffy time travels, it is an easy read and enjoyable. It took me a little while to let go and accept the fantasy/fairy tale aspect of the book, but once I did I had no problem following the story line.My highest praise for the book is its thoroughness. Ms. Jackson leaves no holes and the ending is satisfying as it does not feel rushed as it does in so many books.So, I'm a little tired today as I couldn't put the book down until I finished it at 1:30 this morning, but it was worth it.

Melanie Jackon blends her obviously love of Scotland with the fantasy touch of fiction in a bewitching brew. Dead on history is guaranteed when you read Jackson, who writes in a captivating voice and a true understanding and love of the genre.

It was a bit hard to follow in parts but the story line was interesting enough to keep me at it. I liked the fact that the heroine is a strong yet vulnerable woman who can stand on her own but also knows when to lean on her man. The hero is a very sensitive man who probably because of his heritage makes him irresitible to his heroine.This is a combo of a timeswept/fantasy romance. The heroine, Taffy starts off in the 1880's and ends up in the 1640's. She is helping her father with his archeology by taking photographs of the bones they have discovered of a piper. The piper was killed after warning of a trap. His hands had been cut off and he bled to death. While taking the shot she sees a ghost who happens to be the piper himself. The piper, Malcolm, is our hero. She is sent back in time to save him by the fairies. She and he both are of fairy blood and the fairies need them.Together they must overcome their human enemies and the fairy dangers which await them. I enjoyed the excitement in this book.

No, make that five to match this five-star rating. She's gone out on a limb to combine fantasy and history and pulls it off beautifully. I noticed another reviewer commented on an inaccurate date printed in the book--that's not a review, that's nit-picking. Read this story and delve into its magical, imaginative world--you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Night Visitor (Timeswept)","review":"NIGHT VISITOR, by Melanie Jackson, purports to be a ghost story/romance--the blurb on the back cover would certainly lead one to believe that--but in actuality it's more of a quasi-paranormal/time travel/fairy tale romance. Although one can't help but admire Jackson's originality, VISITOR was often confusing, both in the way the story was structured and in the writing itself, and the characterizations suffered because of this. NIGHT VISITOR will appeal to some people, especially those who love anything to do with Scotland, but it's not a particularly good novel, despite its inventiveness.Okay, here's the premise: In 1888, Tafaline, a young woman who's rather independent for the time period, is spending the summer helping her misogynistic father photograph archaeological sites in Scotland. When the bones of &quot;The Piper&quot; are found in a castle called Duntrune, Taffy is called in to photograph them for prosterity. According to legend, The Piper had his hands chopped off for playing his pipes in order to warn someone named McColla that Duntrune was under siege by the evil Campbells (actually, it technically wasn't under siege, because it was the Campbells' castle to begin with, but never mind). Now, he's a ghost. Legend also says that anyone who touches the bones of a ghost will have that ghost haunt them until they go mad--unless they're a MacLeod, in which case they'll simply be called away to the land of the fairies. Of course, Taffy touches the Piper's bones, so guess what happens next.As I mentioned before, the story is pretty original, but the way it was told was utterly confusing to me. For one thing, why open the novel with the bishop, several months AFTER the Piper's bones have been discovered, especially since the bishop doesn't play hardly any role at all in the story? Also, when the book first shifts over to Malcolm's (the piper's) viewpoint (page 36, just in case anyone was wondering), the date listed is 1964! Now, I'm admittedly not well-versed on Scottish history, but I don't think all this war stuff was going on in the sixties in Scotland--which means that the date was either a mistake, which is really incredibly sloppy, or simply nonsensical. Furthermore, once Malcolm does enter the picture, the point of view between him and Taffy changes so often that it's hard to get a sense of the characters. They both do a lot of stuff, but I can't recall them ever feeling anything in the way of emotions. Thus, while they both seem like very interesting characters at the very beginning of the novel, they quickly become flat and two-dimensional.All in all, NIGHT VISITOR wasn't what I expected it to be. It lies off the beaten path of paranormal/time travel/fairy romances, and thus might turn some people off--truly, I would only recommend this book to fans of the OUTLANDER series and to those who enjoy Scottish historicals."},{"Title":"The Director's Companion","review":"After much shopping, Amazon's shopping network landed me the best deal from one of the thousands, or is it hundreds, of stores in their network.College textbooks are hard to find at reasonable prices and Amazon supplied this one at about 28% below the lowest average price.Thanks guys"},{"Title":"Paradise Kiss, Book 4","review":"If you love Mana, you'll love Isabella.

Which is unfortunately what ends up happening to most people as they grow up, they let go of their dreams for \\"reality\\".In Volume 4 the Fashion Show is about to happen and now Yukari and George's relationship is not such a sure thing. What seemed like a match made in heaven is now seeming to become something that can never truly work out. George hates to be tied down and is far to flighty to maintain a long-term relationship, especially once reality hits.Yukari is getting ready for her college exams and finding work as a model, George is still uncompromising, and the whole Paradise Crew remains optimistic, even when its seems failure is eminent. The thing about this volume is how realistically it deals with the relationship of George and Yukari and the triangle of Miwako, Arashi, and Tokumori. This volume and the last volume make it pretty clear that its no longer a fantasy, but some of the Paradise crew are starting to face \\"reality\\", for better or worse.Oh, and another thing, guess what!

Not only are the outfits portrayed in the story fabulous, the story it's self is solid. The drawing ranging from simple and elegant to technical and elegant (this goes back to the detail payed to the fashion aspects). Paradise Kiss revolves around the life of Yukari aka Caroline, who after being hunted down by Arashi, on the streets, to be the model for a fashion show, gets swept up in the world of the Yaza School for the Arts student designer group Paradise Kiss. Paradise Kiss consists of George (Yukari's love intrest, also the head of Parakiss because he designs the clothes), Miwako (who's sister also attended Yaza School for the Arts and is now the top desinger for Happy Berry), Arashi (Miwako's Boyfriend), and Isabella (a stately drag queen, who cooks a mean feast). Yukari who was frustrated with her school and her demanding mother, breaks out into the modeling world...but soon finds things aren't as easy as they seem at first glance, especially not her tangled relationship with George. I can't wait until the next issue comes out in the US, to bad i have no clue when that will be.

The answer she gives is Romans 6:17 \\"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.\\" The book's filled with total importance of obedience and works. The author seems to forget Ephesians 2:8-9 \\"for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; Not of works, lest any man should boast.\\"I read of the importance for a wife to obey her husband. Total obedience, even if he's a cruel tyrant. There's no grace/love in this teaching and it's completely subjugating of women. If a woman has a concern about pregnancy and birth control -- forget about the pill; out of the question. The book's full of hyperbole and fear-mongering, which is much of the Gothard-based/IBLP teaching that Thiele shares. She seems to inwardly fear the examples of husbands leaving their \\"contentious\\" wives to leave home for an affair. Her teachings also make little sense in regards to the idea that man leads and the woman follows (a hiearachal system in marriage she teaches), but on the other hand she explains how men won't lead unless their wives allow them to lead(?) Here's an idea: Leaders lead.It's so legalistic; don't do this; do this; don't watch television; don't use birth control; obey. Where's the Holy Spirit allowed to get a still, small Word in edgewise? She's so judgemental, page 115 \\"If those who \\"claim\\" to be Christian stopped watching television and going to the movies, Hollywood would stop making disgusting movies!\\" Does she feel the same about the movie Amazing Grace (produced by the actress Patricia Heaton from \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\") or Facing the Giants movie? She calls television/movie watching a \\"horrible addiction\\". Her writing sounds like she resents her husband (read page 117) resolves herself to putting up with him. I wonder how much he's had to put up with her with these testimonies. Certainly there's no \\"Song of Solomon\\" type love a wife is encouraged in this book.Birth control: She's staunch in her belief that Christians are to \\"be fruitful and multiply\\" by not preventing pregnancy. I don't believe in abortion, but she takes it another step (Gothard?) and says even natural family planning is a slip into a gray area (page 147) and even says this outright twisting of the Precious Scripture to suit her purpose here: \\"Once we Christians started to tolerate the \\"gray\\" areas beginning with natural family planning, it was then easy to slip into a darker gray, the Pill and the IUD. Now we have the black area -- ABORTION! 'So because you are lukewarm [using birth control] and neither cold [which is abortion] nor hot [trusting God entirely for your fertility], I will spit you out of my mouth. (Rev. 3:16).\\"She goes on to repeat Mary Pride's judgemental hyperbole from her book The Way Home. I won't bother to point out that my husband and I made the personal decision to have me get a tubal ligation after our 4th child, when she was born with 2 serious conditions that threatened her life -- double-outlet right ventricle (heart) and a twisted intestine. These conditions were likely the result of my having insulin-dependent diabetes since childhood. Oh, that's right. According to Gothard, all disease is probably the result of some sin I committed (obviously so grievous I don't recall it when I was 12) and I should've gone to IBLP conferences to deal with it. no thanks.The mishandling Revelation 3:16 should tell discerning people, those whose sins were forgiven through the life, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, that this book is full of holes and half-truths. She throws labels around to inflict pain on those who disagree (page 148) \\"As a Christian, whom do you choose to believe, God or the feminists?\\" Some christian women disagree with her, and so we would be labeled \\"feminists\\". Well, Jesus ate with the tax collectors and \\"sinners\\", so if it was good enough for Him to be labeled, it's good enough for me. The teaching she has on the closing of wombs is abysmal. She takes scriptures out of context.. So, now I'm a harlot, for praying/asking God for wisdom with my husband to have a tubal, to prevent the suffering in any future children I'd have. My child suffered till she died at 2 yrs. My own health was at serious risk with the diabetes, but that doesn't seem to factor into her teachings. Our prayerful steps in our marriage, along with others' prayers, is considered a \\"curse\\" or \\"punishment\\" from God according to Mrs. Thiele. My faith isn't in question, I know \\"Whom I have believed\\". I've also experienced a real miracle AFTER my daughter died, so I know about faith. It actually has nothing to do with my own \\"works\\", but everything to do with Who my Savior is. \\"Aren't the children who have it all -- the toys, clothes and their own rooms -- the most ungrateful, spoiled and miserable?\\" Nonsense! It's presuppositional judgement. Drugs, cults, suicide -- fear teachings if you give your kids those. \\"Since you are on God's mission, He will be faithful as long as you trust Him to guide you.\\" It's up to you! I guess I must've mis-read the verse \\"if we are faithless, he remains faithful -- for he cannot deny himself\\". LOT of works taught. She questions whether it's wise to send your children off to college. Who is she to judge another man's servant? Some are sent into the world to study medicine (I'm sure she has benefitted from) helping others. College facilitates this. Book's chock full of the OT Law. Jesus came and fulfilled the law/ordinances, nailing them to His cross, and raising to Life."},{"Title":"A Wise Woman","review":"This book has so much insight and will help anyone who is willing to follow the principles in this book.

If you marriage is in trouble, you and your spouse are arguing, separated, divorced, etc. this book will completely change your entire outlook on the situation.I began reading and applying the principles in this book and another Erin Thiele book HOW GOD CAN AND WILL RESTORE YOUR MARRIAGE within in a week of my husband announcing that he wanted a divorce, that our marriage was over, and all bridges had been burned. I was completely shocked because I thought I had done everything right.I found out that I had not followed the Biblical Principles for marriage and to be a godly wife that God spells out in his word, The Bible. The minute that I started to put in to action the Godly principles that Erin writes in her books (all 100% scripturally based) I started to see a turn around in my marriage.This is a must read for anyone that is engaged, newly married, or long time married.

THIS IS A MUST READ FOR EVERY MARRIED WOMAN."},{"Title":"A Wise Woman","review":"All you really have to do is read this woman's views of marriage, one of God's most sacred creations, to know how unstable and often unChristian her doctrine is. I have a hunch that author Erin Thiele's doctrine twistings have more to do with a fooled mind than a malicious heart, but that doesn't make her words any less poisonous.First, Thiele begins with befouling marital submission, one of the most commonly abused concepts of marriage. Turning the concept of healthy submission into authoritarian obedience is just the beginning of Thiele's twistings; according to her, wives must always obey their husbands no matter what, even if their husbands ask them to sin! Like so many before her, in order to twist the marital doctrine, Thiele twists Biblical examples in order to support her views. She actually backs up her \\"obey your husband into sin\\" idea with the ridiculous claim that Sarah obeyed Abraham by lying about their relationship, and that God approved of this because He didn't punish her. God didn't bless Sarah's obedience, He saved her from bad men. This does not mean He approved of her actions or Abraham's.Indeed, Thiele does believe that you can freely sin so long as your husband tells you to first; she quite literally says, \\"Women are not responsible when they obey their husbands\\". I've seen this before: women like Thiele not only obey their husbands to a fault (literally), but they attempt to blame their husbands for any sins they commit. Thiele, YOU are responsible for your actions, not your husband. The only way you will escape the blame for your husband's actions is if you refuse to comply with them and leave him to his own devices. If you go along with him in sin, though, don't bother trying to pull the trick of blaming your spouse for your sin; that doesn't work for women anymore than it did for Adam. If you don't believe me, just read the story of Ananias and Saphira: both sinned and both ended up dead. I can't imagine how many gullible women might read this book and actually believe that God would not only approve of them sinning against Him at their husband's command, but let them off the hook because \\"hubby made me do it\\".When I say that Thiele exhorts obedience even at the face of sin, I'm not exaggerating. In fact, Thiele goes even further and claims that wives shouldn't even show resistance to their husbands, including in times of horrid treatment and verbal abuse. Thiele tells wives that even in the face of abhorrence and ridicule from our husbands, we cannot do anything but return \\"blessings\\". She actually uses the example of Christ not showing resistance to His haters and scoffers! Use context, please. Jesus did NOT either do nothing in the face of true evil (other than His crucifiction, which was pre-planned) or act reactive rather than proactive. There were many times when He either gently or vehemently reproved bad behavior, and He did anything but sit quietly. Another flawed and unacceptable example.Here is a summary of Thiele's comments, word by word, confirming the twisted doctrine I described:\\"God is clear that no matter what treatment we receive, we are to remain respectful and submissive\\"\\"We obey without even a word, especially when our husbands are being disobedient to God's word\\"\\"We are not allowed to use tough love but be quiet and gentle always\\"I guess beaten women are to remain \\"respectful and submissive\\" by not calling the authorities and letting their husbands beat them to death? Is this God's doing too? How about following our husbands into sin, and then trying to escape blame from it?Speaking of the \\"no tough love\\" schlock, Thiele claims that women are not even to try persuading their husbands away from sin. We are not to speak at all, she says, just to obey; no matter what our husbands either do to us or ask us to do. This is the EXACT opposite of what every other Christian author says. If you look at even the most conservative authors, they'll tell you to obey your husband EXCEPT when he sins (never ever obey him then) and, by all means, to try and persuade him away from sin. How is it that Thiele has created a doctrine that not only contradicts the Bible, but even all the other patriarchal authors?After the sickening chapters on marriage, Thiele goes on to mess up what God says about divorce. Of course she's against it no matter what; after her words on how to deal with an abusive husband, naturally she doesn't think abuse is cause for even resistant behavior. In fact, she doesn't mention physical abuse at all in her chapter on divorce. Instead, she puts all overly-conservative authors before her to shame by claiming that divorce is only acceptable when FORNICATION occurs. Not adultery, but fornication. In other words: a spouse is only allowed to divorce their partner if they discover that said partner was not a virgin upon marriage. At this point, I really didn't think Thiele could get anymore unBiblical, but I was wrong. Not only is it ludicrous to think that fornication is worse than adultery (which actually consists of breaking a holy vow AS WELL as having sex out of marriage), but nowhere does the Bible claim anywhere near the NT that it's okay to divorce a spouse based on their actions before marriage. Whatever happened to forgiveness? If you sinned with someone before you got married, that's between you and God. Yes, your spouse DOES have the right to know about your previous sexual acts, but that doesn't give them the right to act as though you were married to them and owed them loyalty before you even met. With these words, Thiele has officially proven to be living by obsolete OT law rather than Christ's law.In short, there's really nothing whatsoever I can recommend about this book, much less this author. I have literally never seen so many theological errors at one time in my life. Don't get this book, please; don't even go near it.As one last thought, Thiele claims in her chapter on submission that obeying a husband will protect a wife from deception (even, you recall, if the husband himself is the biggest fool in the world). Well Thiele, you've only served to prove to me once again that obeying a husband is the last thing a wife should ever do. Because if you're any example, obeying your husband has brought you nothing but deception of the worst sort. I'm not blaming your husband for your own behavior; that's your job."},{"Title":"A Wise Woman","review":"After reading \\"How God Can and Will Restore Your Marriage\\" I regretted not buying this book at the same time.

Erin Thiele went through the loss of relationship and family wholeness for a time in order to learn about \\"the little foxes\\" that destroy the vine of marriage relationship. In her clear and unapologetic style, she helps hurting wives take themselves to God with their pain and losses. He is the source. Then we can allow Him to teach us the way out of despair and selfish grasping, and see the way to walk through adultery, addiction, walls of hostility, and get to the other side.If you have been looking for answers, and found yourself dissatisfied with 'divorce recovery' or 'abuse recovery' or 'tough love' approaches, and wonder why they have not taken away the ache for family healing deep within you, then you have come to a good alternative. My hope in God's ability to restore people and families has been greatly encouraged.If you want some honest answers and are tired of the rhetoric of the \\"me, me, me\\" the predominant noise of the world is offering, you have come to the right place.

It is written in a casual, conversational style yet it contains very scholarly information. Ostensibly aimed at a young adult or even younger audience it appeals just as well to adults. The main text runs about 105 pages with an appendix. It gives detailed information on the arms, armor and fighting style of the Germanic peoples that overran the Roman empire in Western Europe from around 400-800 A.D. It is the little details that really appealed to me, such as how the sword hilts were constructed, different makers marks on blades, and centers of manufacture. The excellent illustrations by the author compliment the text nicely as well. The author ended this study around 800 A.D. because that is when new metalworking technology changed the types of swords being made, thus beginning a new era in weaponry and swords in particular.

The vocabulary is light and easy to identify with and the &quot;exercises&quot; at the end of each chapter are simple to put into practice. I have already found the contents of this book so thought provoking that I have been able to reassess and reassemble several old and tired thought patterns that I held for many years. The results are immediate and rewarding. Caroline's dialogue is clear and straightforward. She uses personal narratives and experiences to demonstrate a point or principle, and I have found myself both amused and humbled by her admissions. I have had the pleasure of attending several of her courses and because her book contains many of her expressions, it is as if she is there actually reading the contents out loud.The method of setting the topics out and seperating them into 7 weeks work gives the reader a chance to work on one particular area as a complete concept before moving onto another. The guidelines are simple to follow yet encourage the reader to delve deeper within their own self, to work on the roots and core of personal existence. As I said before I have this book with me always. It has often felt as if I am on this life jouney with a companion to share the road with. I felt strongly that all the laws that Caroline expands on are formed out of her own self discovery and based on her own personal awareness. She explains the depth to which her life had sunk before she became aware that there was a better and more fulfilling way to live. I found this very humbling to read.THIS BOOK IS A MUST for anyone and everyone. From those who are on a quest of self discovery and personal growth to those who enjoy understanding more about life around them. You can pick this book up and read one page or a chapter. There is no need to recap over several pages to refresh the reader on the theme of the exercise. This has been very handy for me as I lead a very hectic life and at times am only able to catch a couple of pages. There is no compulsory hard work entailed in this read, the hard work is of personal choosing in making the 7 lessons part of ones life.I shall always be able to pick up Caroline's book as a reference and important refresher course if I should need reminding of the way be keep myself spiritually fit. There is a lot in the book that once taken on board seems so obvious and clear, that it makes understanding the contents so natural. It is very well set out and presented with clear demarcations between chapters. From the first one on &quot;motivation recharge&quot; to the last on &quot;Holding your power and living with joy&quot; the reader is taken step by step through a natural journey of inner growth. There is a valuable conclusion to each chapter with exercises to practice and thoughts to ponder on.Participation with the book is out of choice and there are no assumption that everyone is proceeding at the same level or to the same degree. There is a relaxed feel to the book which is not only relfected in the unspoken invitation to keep picking the book up to see what is said next, but also in the helpful cross-referencing throughout and index at the end. Caroline has a warm and smoothe voice, gently yet with a powerful message. Her inspitational and thought provoking book reflects these qualities in her. It is been a delightful read, a valuable teacher and sympathetic companion. My life has changed in very possitive ways since starting to open the cover and delve within its contents.

Amazingly, it speaks just as powerfully to me, a 30-year veteran of \\"human potential\\" and \\"spiritual growth\\" books and workshops who thought she'd read it all, as it would to a neophyte. If you do the simple exercises at the end of each chapter, your life is almost guaranteed to change for the better. But even readers who don't do the homework will find the book uplifting and rewarding. It's easy to read yet profound at the same time.As a woman in a major life transition, I find this book a wonderful companion on my journey of personal growth and change, as it confirms and validates my own intuition and sense of the Truth. One term that especially resonated with me but with which I was previously unfamiliar is \\"non-alignment fatigue,\\" describing that drain of energy that comes when one is with companions whose emotions are different from our own.

Most importantly, I wanted to do them again.It's organized as a week-to-week program, and I went through it that way rather quickly and have found myself returning to particularly challenging areas again and again. Luckily, the book not only invites rereading, but rewards it -- many of the exercises that didn't resonate for me (and thus I skipped the first time through) were actually quite powerful the second (or, okay, third... fourth) time around.There are plenty of books about spirituality out there, and sometimes it's easier to just move on to the next one hoping \\"it\\" will change your life.

And is as a result VERY much bigger. I memorized the relevant chapter of my 1980 copy on my 1996 trip to this Wyoming range so as not to need to carry the book. But it was more a Light Gesture than anything else. (And there was little information in that chapter of any kind - the thing that attracted me to that specific area more than anything else, I think.) There is no way I'd carry the book now. The additions were important, don't get me wrong; much climbing has been done in the range since 1980. (Although that chapter has hardly changed at all. And it's mob-level national-park-quality scenery, if anyplace in the Winds is.) But not only is the 1994 book HYOOOGE by comparison to its predecessor; some of the poetry suffered as well. Kelsey might have thought it too above a broad audience, although his general bent wouldn't make me think he'd do something like that for that reason. (His refusal to \\"talk down\\" to beginners may intimidate some; it was downright thrilling to me.) Still and all, it's such a wonderful read that I had to force myself to put it down early this morning in an effort to get at least some sleep, something which has never given me a problem with any other guidebook I've seen. It helped me imagine the Winds before I went better than any other guide has done that job; it takes me back there now whenever I pick it up.I frequently pick up Kelsey, in fact, just to read him, apropos of nothing. OK, maybe not apropos of nothing. It does help if you have been there. Especially for a week, as I did in '96, and most especially if, as I did last week, you follow that up by spending more than 100 miles on the road with the range forming the dramatic wall-to-wall backdrop the entire way. You can't miss the Winds, which makes it amazing how so many do. The only high point I actually ascended on my \`96 trip saw its first recorded ascent, by the route I took, right around the time some of the middle-aged folk reading this started hiking. Can't find that too many places outside of caving, can you?Kelsey treats the Winds the right way. He's a fitting - and better, if you just ask me - successor to Finis Mitchell. No matter what you are doing in the backcountry of the Wind Rivers, this book will help you get there, and not intrude once you are there.

I first read this book a dozen years ago and it has continued to haunt me since.Origo has created a masterpiece from her tale of Leopardi's short and lonely life. This is a book where the atmosphere is more important than the facts. No poet could object to coming to life, thus, between the lines setting forth Origo's appreciation of his art and sympathy for his suffering.Leopardi can hope for no better chance of literary resurrection than that given to him by Iris Origo. If this biography sends you in search of his poetry it has done its job."},{"Title":"Leopardi: A Study in Solitude","review":"iris origo really has something here, and her poetic biography of the great giacomo leopardi is a classic in itself. the darkness and despair of leopardi's verse is probably one reason for leopardi's obscurity and little known philosophical works, but the overwhelming sense of nothingness and meaninglessness that his work conveys is no reason to put him aside. we do not necessarily have to agree with an author about everything to enjoy the aesthetic brilliance and the passion present in his essays and poetry. anyone who gets a dark thrill (as i do) from philosophy and poetry that focuses on the more shadowy and sad side of existence will devour leopardi's work. he would undoubtedly gotten along with and befriended the two other great literary prophets of doom, samuel beckett and arthur schopenhauer, and unconsciously shares their philosophy and really disturbing reflections about the emptiness of human life and it's accidental and contingent origin. leopardi was a quite genuine pessimist, unlike schopenhauer who betrayed through his lifestyle and even occasionally in his work itself a love and passion for life and art, and his gloom is not simply temperamental or tongue in cheek as it with arthur, but is very serious and profoundly felt. leopardi's work openly refers to the poetic imagination and man's feelings of divinity or supremacy in the universe as &quot;beautiful illusions&quot;, which is all the more infuriating to those who have them because does not violently condemn them or even make an effort to disprove them objectively, but just dismisses them offhandedly as the obvious products of wishful thinking and fanciful self delusion. despite the depressing and sometimes unbearable bleakness of his work, i think giacomo leopardi is unjustly obscure and the best italian poet since dante. all of his work is a must read for students or lovers of philosophy and poetry."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Upon the release of ML's 100 greatest English-lanuage novels of this century, it was to my great sadness to find &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; missing from the list. It seemed to confirm what I'd feared for the last several years: even critics have left this spectacular collection behind.Perhaps it is the fact that of the book's length that frightens off so many readers: at 800+ pages it doesn't exactly make for easy beach reading. Keep in mind, however, that the book is comprised not only of three separate novels but also of connecting interludes.If you want to read truly great literature of such a standard that earned John Galsworthy a Nobel Prize for Literature, you need look no further than &quot;The Forsyte Saga.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"The 1933 Scribner's edition of this classic trilogy is worthwhile because of the preface by Ada Galsworthy, the author's wife. Combined with the dedication (from John to Ada), it paints an inspiring picture of a marriage between two creative minds who respected each other's talents. The trilogy itself is an inspiring artifact of a life spent working hard. Galsworthy finished the first book, Man of Property in 1906, at the age of 39. He put the project aside for something like 12 years and then finished the last two novels when in his mid-50s. Most people only read the first book but the last two deepened my appreciation for the first and for Galsworthy's talent."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"The writing evident in this epic is masterful and engaging: it is even and substantive and elegant. The rich irony about the lengths that men strive to acquire property in all its forms and then find their acquisitions useless, meaningless and certainly not worth the price. Galworthy was focused upon property in so many different varieties: the sense of possession that men had of their wives in his time amid archaic laws about divorce; the building of a home that ends in unexpected expense in chancery; the elusive value of works of art; the subtleties of property from family crests, clubs, colleges and occupational status and cuts of mutton to the blatant futility of fighting over land in South Africa during the Boer War -- it's all shallow and empty materialism in the end. The property is never worth the cost of the trouble to acquire it. Young people slave to gather possessions only to regret in old age that they have traded so much of life away to gain them and must undergo the painful rigors of its redistribution through wills after death. Galsworthy seemed to me like a sort of British Tolstoy writing in England for property reform. Because when property is involved, men tend to objectify about it and in the course of things they tend to lose their sense of humanity. This troublesome pattern of life seems to repeat itself often like a lesson men never learn -- as the objectifying I-It relationship of Martin Buber replaces the humane I-Thou. Yes, it's a long novel but when the writing is this compelling in its style and substance, you can luxuriate in the beauty and wisdom of the words. Every character is finely and individually drawn like a character in a Velasquez portrait of a large family. You may regret that this edition isn't longer when it ends but fortunately there is more of his work in which to indulge. Galsworthy's work earned him a Nobel Prize -- it's easy to see the astonishing depth and range and virtuosity that the Nobel judges found in his writing. Don't pass up the chance to bask in this epic saga of Galsworthy. It's easily one of the top ten novels ever written in the English language -- it's really that good."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"What an infinite study of character, the Forsyte character, men of ownership, of possession, of material things!I waited for the PBS presentation with patient enthusiasm, and was not disappointed. But knowing that video/movies can only do so much for a text, I unearthed my own private copy of Galworthy's book, one inherited from my aunt, and started the discovery by print.I have been so overcome by Galsworthy's skill as a wordsmith, and so fascinated by his social commentary on this class of people, that I have broken away from the novel time and time again and done further research into Galsworthy and his own commentaries of his work, particularly on the Forsytes. From his wife, Ada's preface, through his intro, to his chosen dedications, I am enchanted. I feel remiss to not have read him before this time, but so grateful to have an old copy and to now enrich my life with these characters.While not disappointed by the TV rendering, I am glad to know Soames, Irene, Old Jolyon, Young Jolyon, June, as Galsworthy painted them. I am glad to see their physical makeup to be different than those of the actors and actresses in the PBS series, and to feel I know them much more completely now.I have a personal love of British lit and am so pleased to find such great storytelling in an older text. The judges were so right in awarding prizes to Galsworthy.The Forsyte Saga is not so foreign in time and portrayal. Materialism still reigns and seduces and corrupts. Class one-up-manship still deludes. Self-importance and shallow values still prevail. Feet of clay forever are feet of clay."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"The Forsyte Saga is a sprawling drama in 3 Volumes/novels which won John Galsworthy the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. I enjoyed all 3 Volumes immensely - the writing is most beautiful, the storylines absorbing, the characters felt \\"real\\" and the dialogue wonderfully engaging.All 3 Volumes are published by Penguin. Each Volume has 800-900 pages and is divided into 3 Books:1. Volume 1: \\"The Man of Property\\", \\"In Chancery\\" and \\"To Let\\".2. Volume 2: \\"The White Monkey\\", \\"The Silver Spoon\\" and \\"Swan Song\\".3. Volume 3: \\"Maid In Waiting\\", \\"Flowering Wilderness\\" and \\"Over the River\\".Here's the gist of the story from each Volume:Volume 1: Meet the Forsytes - a rich, upper-class family in old England. Before you start, study the 'Family Tree' page first because it's helpful to remember how the numerous major characters are related. Note: My review will not be revealing any plot that you can't already gather from the Family Tree. The story begins in the late 1870s with Soames Forsyte (an old-fashioned, smart solicitor and art-collector) falling in love with a penniless beauty, Irene (pron.: \\"I-re-nee\\"). They marry but Irene is unhappy because she does not love Soames. Later, she meets a young architect, Philip Bosinney - they fall in love and have an affair. Problem is, Philip is June Forsyte (Soames' niece)'s fiance. Suspense, drama and great tragedy ensue when Soames and June find out. Some years pass. Jolyon (a cousin of Soames and an outcast of the family) and Irene are thrown together by circumstances and they fall in love. Irene has his child, Jon. Soames is heartbroken a second time. There is a bitter divorce. Soames later marries a French woman, Annette and they have a child, Fleur. Fleur and Jon grow up and fall in love with each other, unaware of the feud between their families...Note: Both the book and TV-series (adapted in 2002) feature Chopin's music (which is played by Irene on the piano). So if you like Chopin, you'll be pleased! Another thing is that the reader will either love/hate Irene. The author only describes her actions, but never let us know her thoughts or feelings. Everything we read about Irene is from the eyes or viewpoint of the other characters. Hence, on the pages, she appears cold and distant. Personally, I do not like Irene; my sympathy lies with Soames (whom I feel is unfairly and cruelly treated by Irene).Volume 2 is about Fleur and her relationship with her ageing father (Soames) and her husband (Michael Mont). Initially, Fleur appears to handle married life well - 'grooming' her husband for Parliament and throwing social parties. But 3 crises emerge to test her: a court action filed by a former friend (lots of mud-slinging here), having to \\"manage\\" Wilfrid Desert (her husband's best friend who is in love with her) and the return of Jon to England and their rekindled love. There is also an engaging subplot involving an impoverished balloon-seller, Tony Bicket and his wife.Volume 3 is unputdownable (like Volume 1). Here, we meet the Charwells, distant relations of the Forsytes (Michael Mont's mother is a Charwell). The time period is 1920s to early 1930s. The heroine is Elizabeth (\\"Dinny\\"), a most charming and endearing character. In Book 1, she tries to help her brother, Hubert who faces a murder charge. She also has to fend off 2 (unwelcome) admirers. In Book 2, Dinny falls in love (at last) with someone who first appeared in Volume 2. Their relationship is not smooth-sailing and you just know Dinny is headed for a heartbreak. There is also a troubling religion issue with no practical solution in sight. In Book 3, Dinny helps her younger sister, Clare who runs away after physical abuse by her husband. There is later a court proceeding (which is superbly written). Meanwhile, Fleur provides some smart advice and shows her generosity in an unexpected way. As for Dinny, she has not recovered from her earlier heartbreak but a new suitor appears on the scene (and he is really quite perfect...). Volume 3 is romantic and I loved it best.The Forstye Saga is a glorious and unforgetable read. It has the power to draw every sorts of emotion from the reader (joy, sadness, suspense, anger, laughter, tears). Put this title high on your list of must-reads. All 3 Volumes are highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more \\"Adventure! Action!\\" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Galsworthy was the first to borrow the term &quot;saga&quot; from the Nordic epic poems to apply to a lengthy novelistic study of a family: the trilogy, his masterpiece, influenced more writers in this century than probably can be counted (most eminently Robert Graves and -- in THE YEARS -- Virginia Woolf). Although it very quickly went out of fashion among the modernist writers of his time, THE FORSYTE SAGA has remained a popular hit, inspiring no less than two famous BBC mini-series. And it's the real deal: I can think of few novel cycles that are as satisfying or as eminently readable, much less that are as minutely crafted. (The continuing themes of possesion and death cycle throughout the saga in such fascinating ways that it is almost impossible to believe Galsworthy wrote the first novel, THE MAN OF PROPERTY, without intending to build a trilogy out of it.) The best edition in print seems to be the Oxford World's Classics edition in that it comes with an indispensable family tree."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \\"The Forsyte Saga,\\" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \\"Saga\\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to \\"own\\" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than \\"property.\\"The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English \\"Age of Innocence.\\" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (\\"Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl\\") and lushly written descriptives (\\"... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago\\").Yet there are touching moments too, like Old Jolyon paying a visit to his estranged son and his lower-class second wife, and the grandchildren he has never met. The awkwardness, love and pain in these scenes is truly astounding.As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to \\"own\\" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the \\"Forsye Saga,\\" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"The first volume of \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" contains three novels and two interludes between each. It chronicles the lives of the Forsyte family between more than 30 years. In his narrative, John Galsworthy deals not only with the family's fortunes but also the society of their time, and its changes.\\"The Man of Property\\" is the first novel of the monumental Forsyte Saga and in the beginning the writer spends some time creating his environment where those Forsyte will inhabit.The first chapters turn out to be the more descriptive in the book. Not only does he introduces the most important members of the family, but he also describe their moral-social relationships -- that count much more than their blood relations.Once Galsworthy feels that his characters are established -- and it doesn't take too many pages, as a matter of fact -- he starts the narrative per se, although a slight plot has been developed from the beginning.\\"The Man of Property\\" concerns more on old Jolyon Forsyte's life and his son and his nephew Soames and Soames' wife, Irene (one of the most unforgettable characters in the saga). Soames is the man of property, but not only has he got unanimated properties but he also considers himself the owner of Irene. She will involve herself with another man, and this love affair will affect the all Forsytes in some levels.This novel is a great beginning for Galsworthy's saga, with vivid characters, a well-built plot and charming writing. While the writer is developing the family affairs, he has the chance to portray the changes in the high society life in the early XX Century in England.In the second installment of \\"The Forsyte Saga\\", the writer reassumes the life of the Forsyte family. \\"In Chancery\\" is situated a few years after the events told in \\"The Man of Property\\", in a few pages recaps some of the most important facts of the first book and their aftermath. After that he is able to move on.And on he moves -- but the narrative still concerns on young Jolyon, Soames and Irene that forms a love triangle. While the remaining Jolyon become a close friend to Irene, her ex-husband --from whom she hasn't divorced in all those years -- fells jealous and considers claiming his wife back.Needless to say that this is not the only plot in the novel. Galsworthy develops more family plots. It is impossible not to have the feeling that while he is sometimes depicting the shallowness of the elite from his time, at the same time he has an indulgent look upon the rich and wealthy -- which is not a bad thing as a matter of fact.Those who like \\"The Man of Property\\" will certainly find more pleasure in \\"In Chancery\\". He finishes the book with the perfect hook what will come next.For those who liked \\"The Man of Property\\" \\"In Chancery\\", \\"To Let\\" is a treat. At this point we are in a transition. The old school of Forytes (Jolyon, Soames...) is about to \`resign', while new folks are starting to assume the power and the money (Jolyon's third son, Soames' daughter...). The very old Forsyte school, by the way, is already history.\\"To Let\\" is a novel of transition; it is as if the parents are passing the command to their kids -- at least in terms of narrative. That is why old plots (Irene, Somaes, Jolyon) and new ones are in the center of the narrative.The story is set some twenty years after the ending of \\"In Chancery\\", Soames' and Jolyon's kids are virtually adults but they don't know the plot involving their parents (the story of the first and second novel) and are ready to fall in love. It is not surprise that Fleur (Jolyon's French kid) will fall in love with Jon (Jolyon's third son also named Jolyon).But their main obstacle is not the fact that they are cousins, but the relations from the past. The narrative will focus on this Romeo and Juliet-esque couple whose union --or separation-- lies in a secret hidden in the past.Those who have reached the third installment in the saga are those who have liked it and are looking forward to see what will happen to the Forsyte. So it is no mystery that Galsworthy exploits the family changes as a shadow of the change in their society --set about the 20's of the XX Century. As Britain Empire declines, so does the power of the Forsytes that cannot avoid their hidden skeletons."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"This body of works has moved me unlike any other. I have re-read the Forsyte Saga over and over again. Each time, I am brought to tears. Sadness over Irene's situation and then by the end, for Soames, who wanted nothing more than to love her and lavish upon her all that he could. When Irene and Young Jolyon marry, you want all the best for them, even knowing the pain Soames feels. Throughout the entire history of this family, you share their joys, sorrows and even a little bit of laughter. You just can't help loving Aunts Ann, Julia &amp; Hester. You'll never regret the reading of these books. It took me 4 yrs. of searching thrift stores in order to have all 3 hardbacks. I've never had more fun searching for something!"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Thank you for the excellent service for a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I got hooked on John Galsworthy's Forsyte novels when I saw the BBC TV series in 1969. At that time I sympathized with Irene and Bossinney and hated Soames for what he did to them. Now that I am older I can relate to the Forsytes more and see Irene as a selfish woman who wrecked an entire family - primarily Soames, June, Old Jolyon and her own son, Jon - and whose only redeeming feature was her beauty. And I find it incredible that Galsworthy won the Nobel Prize when so many greater writers - Tolstoy, Twain and Proust, just to name a few - were ignored. Still, as soap opera, \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is fun to read, especially when followed by Gaslworthy's \\"Modern Comedy\\" and \\"The End of the Chapter\\" and even Suleika Dawson's vastly inferior \\"The Forsytes\\".

Really loved it but i don't know if i could continue with the other books in the saga. It was also so informative about that time period (around the Boer War) and the upper social class in England."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"What's a nice book like this doing in a century like the twentieth? In some ways \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is the last of a literary species, that which saw its pinnacle with Anthony Trollope's Victorian chronicles of the middle class and exhausted itself as George Eliot pushed the genre so far past its limits that it had nothing else to do but yield to modernism. Galsworthy, however, does not veer from the traditional style. His saga of a fictional family, intended to represent the English upper middle class (as they are repeatedly and emphatically described), is a compilation of three novels and two short interludes, the entirety completed in 1922, the narrative covering the waning Victorian era and the societal changes that occurred throughout the Edwardian era and the first World War.Thorny and extensive as the Forsyte family tree is, Galsworthy concentrates mainly on a few selected characters and one story line to guide the saga. It begins with a party showing the Forsytes \\"in full plumage\\" as they celebrate the engagement of June, the granddaughter of \\"Old\\" Jolyon Forsyte, the family's current living patriarch, to the architect Philip Bosinney, who has been hired by old Jolyon's nephew, Soames Forsyte, a solicitor, to design a new house for him and his wife Irene. The problem is that Irene is bored with her marriage to Soames and has an affair with Bosinney and then (much later) with \\"Young\\" Jolyon, old Jolyon's son and Soames's cousin.Irene's infidelity leads to her separation from Soames, who mostly wants a son to continue his lineage and implores her to return. Her final rejection of him enables a divorce and gives him the opportunity to marry a pretty French girl named Annette, but he never relinquishes his love for Irene, and her subsequent marriage to young Jolyon causes a rift between the two cousins, exacerbated by the fact that old Jolyon had bought the house that Soames had contracted from Bosinney. Soames and Annette have a daughter named Fleur, from whom he decides to keep his former marriage a secret, which presents a complication when Fleur accidentally meets and falls in love with Jon, the son of young Jolyon and Irene.Galsworthy rescues the story from becoming a trite soap opera by using the particular Forsyte mentality as the supporting theme. According to young Jolyon, who is not as concerned with money as most Forsytes are, a Forsyte has \\"a sense of property\\"; that is, the Forsytes define themselves by their possessions--houses, land, commodities, wives. Soames, the exemplary Forsyte, demonstrates this by being doomed to live a lucrative but loveless life; he is not as pathetic as he is merely typical of his class. The Forsytes compete with each other and become jealous over trifles and perceived superiorities, but, fearful of scandals, they refrain from anything that could bring public disgrace upon the family name.When examined in the context of the contemporary cultural revolution, the saga assumes another dimension. There is a wonderful paragraph in which Soames and Annette witness the funeral procession of Queen Victoria in 1901 and Galsworthy summarizes the \\"transmuting influence\\" of the sixty-four years of her reign, from coaches to motor-cars, the rise of the upper middle class. In the concluding chapter, Soames further contemplates the Forsytian transition at the death of his youngest uncle, which marks the passing of the influential generation of Forsytes that included his own father and old Jolyon. Descended from farmers, a family of merchants, lawyers, realtors, and publishers is coming full circle back to farming and gradually splintering into other families. Eventually, only the name remains."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I got interested in reading this book after viewing the Masterpiece Theater showing of the Forsyte Saga. It was interesting to compare the movie's interpretation of the book, and it gave a little more insight into the motivations of each of the characters. Overall a good book."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I found it a little slow at first and was not used to reading 'proper english'. I found that there is a big difference between English and American/Ozarkien, which is what I speak. But once I got used to it I enjoyed it very much. I was surprised, at first, because even the commentary was written in 'proper english' until I realized that the author was living in that age and was writing as he spoke. The saga takes place at the turn of the century, England. The people are very real and very English. I feel I learned very much about that time and that country. I have since read the next vol (The Modern Comedy) and am now into the final vol. (End of the Chapter). I'm sure I would enjoy them even more if I knew their slang, etc. and many refs to their history. Good reading."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Galsworthy gives his readers a view into the transition between the Victorian culture and the Modern through characters who seem to come alive under his masterful writing.

I thouroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I decided to tackle this book on a recent trip interstate, it's size made it perfect for a long flight, i am so glad i did! This book is often overlooked in discussions about great english litrature which is a shame in my opinion. I know a lot of people might get turned off because it is a BIG book but it is so well written and such an engaging human story that the pages just fly past.The story is very human and eternally relevant, it tells of the Forsyte family in victorian england at the height of upper middle class wealth and privelage. The ownership and increase of property being their main goal in life they are inevitably troubled by affairs of the heart which they cannot control and which make no rational sense to them. The once solid family is torn apart by love and all the hard work which has gone into getting and keeping their property ends up being for nothing.The way the conflict between the emotional impulse for love and happiness and the capitalist instinct for aquiring wealth is told by the author is an absoloute triumph!

And the interlude about Joblen's death so, so rich in the beauty of life and nature. A fine appreciation of life. And one cannot help pitying Soames. What Galsworthy has done here is dissect the nature of a man, and a not very likeable one at that, Soames. But if you read through to the very end, you may come to at least have understanding and compassion for this being, who is caught in his own nature. He cannot help being what he is. This trilogy is one of the best reads of my life. The newer Masterpiece Theatre version captures it very well.

It's a world motivated by keeping up appearances and exercising the strictest control over expression of one's emotions -- that is, if one is to preserve one's status as a proper member of the upper middleclass. Indeed, the only safe emotion is curiosity about how much others have paid for their possessions and whether they are to be congratulated or envied for acquiring something for nothing, or shall they be sneered at and ridiculed for having paid more. The Forsytes are a commercial bunch, everything boils down to financial value for them -- even relationships bear price tags.Old Jolyon is patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Unlike his brothers, he is now scornful of that middleclass ethos they so highly value, often to their detriment. Old Jolyon has lived long enough to regret his deference to appearances, which had cost him his relationship with his only son.The author's indictment against the stern, uncharitable principles cherished by the British upper middleclass is peppered throughout the narration, the characters always replacing any thoughts toward generosity with sound justification (read: excuse) for niggardly self interest. We are used to categorizing characters as victims, villains and heroes. However, in this story it can be argued that everyone is a victim; there are no real heroes or real villains. Because of his unsympathetic nature, cousin Soames might appear a villain, but truly he is as tragic a figure as Mr. Bosinney (the fiance of June, Old Jolyon's granddaughter) who is in love with the tragically beautiful Irene, Soames's wife. Although the reader is generously privy to the thoughts and feelings of the members of the clan, including disagreeable inlaws, it is noteworthy that the reader is only aware of the two tragic characters, Bosinney and Irene, as they are observed by others. The author never allows the reader to trespass directly into their souls to expose all therein. Fortunately for us, these two wear their hearts on their sleeves and others are thereby enabled to read volumes simply by taking advantage of brief observations. We see the reactions of Irene and Bosinney, never their internal motivations.The title of this book begs the question, exactly who is the man of property or to which man of property does the title refer -- and what exactly is the property that is referenced. Ultimately cousin Soames is the man specifically identified in the title, and surely the property particularly stressed is his unyielding wife, the incomparable Irene. Irene is so much the sophisticated lady, so beguiling in appearance and manner, I am reminded of Jane Austen's \\"dear Jane Fairfax\\" (\\"Emma\\") who, like dear Irene, has no money of her own and therefore is compelled to select between the lesser of two (or more) quite unattractive situations. For certainly, when one's station is so reduced, being without the means to _choose_ between this pleasant possibility and that pleasant circumstance, one simply must _decide_ which evil will produce the least harm. In The Man of Property, everyone is selecting -- sometimes their choices backfire and then they must decide the next step. June happily _chose_ to become engaged to marry Bosinney, but later she has to _decide_ how best to keep him or even whether she is at all capable of keeping him.Bosinney also brings to mind another brooding young man from literature -- Mr. Ladislaw of George Eliot's \\"Middlemarch\\", who also was tragically in love with another man's wife. Indeed, when reading the description of Bosinney's high cheek bones, casual manners and the intensity of his emotions, one might be tempted to cast the actor Rufus Sewell in that role; for Sewell's portrayal of Ladislaw was quite memorable in the Masterpiece Theatre television adaptation of \\"Middlemarch\\", another story about keeping up appearances and making happy choices or miserable decisions.The Man of Property moves along very quickly. The author's descriptions of the lifestyle and environment of that time are quite detailed. But for the selfish and unpleasant people who populate this world, the sensitive reader might easily drift into this other time and other place, which for this reader is the mark of a truly rich literary experience."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Re: THE MAN OF PROPERTYStep into the world of upper middleclass London of the late Victorian era, staunchly embodied in the several brothers Forsyte, their sisters, children, inlaws and grandchildren.

Soap opera? Well, sort of -- it's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \\"The Forsyte Saga.\\" While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \\"Saga\\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. One staid family member, Soames Forsyte, becomes obsessed with the beautiful but poor Irene, and finally gets her to marry him -- on condition that if their marriage doesn't work, she walks. Well, their marriage doesn't work. Soames is frustrated that Irene shuts him out of her life and her bed -- even more so when he learns that she is in love with sexy, arty architect Bosinney, who is building them a new house.Soames rapes Irene and ruins Bosinney. His marriage falls into ruins, and Bosinney is killed in a car accident. So Irene leaves permanently, living in an apartment by herself. Then Soames announces that he wants to marry a pretty French girl, Annette, and Irene weds Soames' cousin. But the problems of the older generation get inherited by the younger one -- Soames's daughter falls madly in love with Irene's son, but their parents' secret pasts doom their love.Three novels (\\"A Man of Property,\\" \\"In Chancery,\\" and \\"To Let\\"), connected with two short stories (\\"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\\" and \\"Awakening\\") -- it's a pretty big story, sprawling over three generations and four decades. It's a bit soapy, with all the scandal and family weirdness, but the dignified writing keeps it from seeming sordid.It's a credit to Galsworthy that he can communicate so much without ever getting into his characters' heads. He displays emotion in undemonstrative people like Irene through little mannerisms and twitches. At the same time, he can give us heartrending looks into aging patriarch Old Jolyon's lonely mind. His writing is very nineteenth century, dignified and with plenty of furniture/clothing details. It's pretty dense, but all right once you get used to it.Galsworthy was a solid supporter of women's rights, and you can see in Irene and Soames' relationship -- Soames, who sees his wife as another piece of property, and the determined Irene who only wants her own happiness, but can't afford to live on her own. Their respective kids Jon and Fleur are nice but kind of boring beside their darker, more intense parents.For a look at the social shifts that helped define the twentieth century, take a look at the \\"Forsyte Saga.\\" Or if you just want to soak in a tale of family woe, love, hate and dark secrets, \\"Saga\\" still works."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"It has been decades since I last lost myself in The Forsyte Saga, and this time around, I was amazed at the quality of the writing, its delicacy, its nuance, its depth of feeling and sympathy for an era that was long-gone even at the time of its first writing.John Galsworthy's tale of an upper-class English family spanned three novels and two &quot;interludes,&quot; all of which make up what we think of as the &quot;saga.&quot; Each is a look at the Forsytes, whose family god is property, as they live and die during England's Victorian days up to and including its waning powers after World War I.The story of Soames Forsyte, desperately and tragically in love with his wife, the beautiful Irene, forms the backdrop. Although Soames is supposed to be the enemy--cold, forbidding, and capable of raping his own wife to claim his &quot;rights as a husband,&quot; nevertheless, I have always felt sorry for him, especially in this reading. Would he have been a different man if Irene could have loved him back? Would he have softened, become more human, more able to feel happiness? In later books, he is loved back by his only daughter Fleur (by his second wife), but by then he is too set in his ways to change.And Irene...the modern-day Helen of Troy. The beauty who breaks men's hearts without even knowing it...could she help being so terribly cold to Soames? With her warm, loving nature, could she possibly have found it in herself to love her exact opposite? That dilemma continues through the generations to culminate in a truly intense tragedy involving Irene's only son and Soames' only daughter.I am so glad to have revisited this book once again and seeing it with new eyes. It is so much more than a mere melodrama, and the quality of Galsworthy's writing is much more talented than I had ever realized. The Forsyte Saga should be included among the masterpieces of a certain era. It has the universal truth and staying power that is deserving of status as a true classic."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Everyone's heard of \\"The Forsyte Saga,\\" the BBC family epic of the late Victorian Age. Fewer have read the Galsworthy book, and that's a shame, because it's fascinating on so many levels.On the surface it's the story of Soames Forsyte, the quintessential icon of the growth of the upper middle classes and the decline of the nobility during the Victorian era. Descended from a farmer in Dorset in the not-too-distant past, Soames is a lawyer and a man of property. He buys wisely, sells more wisely, and husbands his wealth and that of the family. He is in control of everything that affects him, except one thing--his wife. Desiring to possess the sensitive, beautiful, genteel but poor Irene, and with the help of a callous mother, Soames pressures Irene into becoming his wife. From this single mistake, the one time Soames let passion rule, his life and the lives of his family and their descendants are changed in unpredictable and frightening ways. Galsworthy's theme is the constant tussle in life between property and art, love and possession, freedom and convention. In the fine tradition of family sagas, these themes play themselves out over and over with each generation.On another level, this is the story of an age, the story of the British Empire at its peak. Galsworthy packs his book with allusions to the great crises of the time, the Boer War and WWI, the rise of Labour, the death of the Queen, the spread of \\"democracy.\\" The Forsyte homes are meticulously detailed, from the French reproduction furniture to the dusty sofas to the heavy drapes, to the fireplace grate, to the electric lights in the old chandeliers. Soames collects art, and Galsworthy showers us with the opinions of a British gentleman of the great and not so great art of the day. The Oxford edition is carefully footnoted, which can be distracting but for this novel, it adds a fascinating level of detail.The saga was written over a period of many years, and on yet another level I found the the changes in Galsworthy's style from the rather clipped, detailed recitations of events and commentary typical of the 19th century to the more expressive style of the 20th. Especially in the first volume of the three, family relationships are painstakingly laid out, the rounds of dinners and family gatherings carefully chronicled. By the third volume, To Let, Galsworthy reveals the love of the countryside and the pain of repressed emotions that the family members a generation ago would have hidden. The writing is very beautiful--as in this sentence: \\"Fleur raised her eyelids--the restless glint of those clear whites remained on Holly's vision as might the flutter of a caged bird's wings.\\"The Oxford edition has an indispensable family tree and an interesting forward, as well as the extensive endnotes. Except for the family tree, these can be safely ignored if you like--the plot carries the reader swiftly along. It took me a good six weeks to plow through The Forsyte Saga, but it was worth it."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I have read most of the great novels and i find this to be far superior to many considered part of the essential western canon. The psychology, subtlety of narrative and memorable characters (Old Jolyon being my favorite in a book chock full of interesting characters) are all above and beyond most novels i have read. There is something wonderful about the scale of the novel and I would often find myself weeping while reading this- people often create their own tragedies and those moments are worth reading about. Simply perfect."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I read the Forsyte saga while I was in college - and was instantly hooked. John Galsworthy wormholes you into a differentworld and time, but as the essence and humanity of his characters unfold, they are extremely familiar even in todays world. What is it about a grand passion that weakens a man of formidable integrity,rigid morals and conservative politics? Irenes forced subjugation to the marital bed leaves pangs, but her beauty is a sinister seduction to all who encounter it, so one falls short of empathy with her... A booming economy, a strong parliament, living in the lap of luxury in the worlds premier city of the time.. can you say AMERICA today? And yet,are we not prisoners of our societal mores? Soames and Irene wereboth prisoners in a marriage - Irenes captivity was more obvious,but he was no less a prisoner - trapped in a passion -shared bymost men - looked at her he really could not see why she didnot return his feelings, and was terrified of losing her, because he was scared of being lonely. Montague and Winifred, Jolyon and Helen - all of them kind of in the same boat. And in the end, the man with the strongest character committed the biggest crime. Or did he? Did Jolyon and Irene not commit a larger crime when they wilfully transferred the feud down to ageneration? Soames and his daughter in the end came to terms withtheir life much better than the more &quot;likeable&quot; characters. John Galsworthy and all his books on the Forsytes read like a treatise on marriage, relationships and a life in society that we must all live in. Ostracism was terrible at the time - it could really ruin lives, and it can even today. He writes about it in its true light and heinousness. I love this series and theensuing trilogy - The White Monkey, The Silver Spoon and Swan Song. It gives me great pleasure to post this review. For a decade almost, John Galsworthy was a staple of my reading &quot;diet&quot;."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"This is a great soap opera sprawling a number of generations from the 1800's to the changing times of the 1920's & 30's. Through this novel we can see the changes that took place in society where money was no object. There is love, lust, adultery, death, birth and friendship. We find in this novel that those with money during this early times were not suffering with the problems of monetary poverty but that of emotional poverty. There are standards to uphold and mistakes are made and status can suffer.You will love this novel, it is a classic and certainly better than any mini series."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Mr. Galsworthy serves up the Forsyte Saga as a sumptuous meal of rich descriptions and savory characters in delightful, bite-size pieces. It is a long read, however, because of such rich character development, these people and their personalities become a subliminal attachment to the reader's circle of friends and acquaintances. Its okay if one is unable to read continuously, because one knows their secrets and stories will keep, and every bit of gossip and story will be saved for the next installment. Galsworthy's story literally leaves the reader hungering for the rest of the story.Why? Galsworthy brillantly reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each of the primary players. While he exposes Soames arrogance and pride, he also reveals Soames confusion, denial, and disbelief, thereby humanising the otherwise 'man of property.' When Irene suggests to Soames the option of dissolving their marriage before they have married, that is, if she is unhappy, one is prompted to read on, carefully, for the clues that explain and support how this might occur.Indeed, this is an oldie... but like a fabulous dessert, it is worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I finished three-quarters of this entire book in less than a week; the first novel of the three in less than two days. That's how good \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is. Galsworthy's writing style is incredible; it's no wonder that this is the novel that won him the Nobel Prize. The story and characters are so captivating that it just drives you onward and onward until the end. The Forsytes themselves are an intriguing lot--especially poor Soames. There's an instinct for the reader to dislike him, and yet Galsworthy shows that he has true human feelings, just like anyone else. His love for Irene and his passionate desire to be loved back is heartbreaking. The morals that Galsworthy incorporates makes the book complete, making it a true monument of literature."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \\"The Forsyte Saga,\\" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \\"Saga\\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to \\"own\\" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than \\"property.\\"The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English \\"Age of Innocence.\\" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (\\"Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl\\") and lushly written descriptives (\\"... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago\\").Yet there are touching moments too, like Old Jolyon paying a visit to his estranged son and his lower-class second wife, and the grandchildren he has never met. The awkwardness, love and pain in these scenes is truly astounding.As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to \\"own\\" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the \\"Forsye Saga,\\" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"I was bored one night and picked up this book that had been on the shelf for probably 20 years. Oh my goodness -- if you love Jane Austen and England, you will love this book. I could not put it down. The characters -- although numerous and many with the same Christian names! -- are kept distinct and are extremely vividly drawn. One realizes how the social sanctions of the day kept people in their place -- just the discussion of what divorce did to a family alone is worth its weight in understanding how social mores have changed. I thought I would be bored stiff and came away 4 days later after finishing this book wanting to start the next one, 700 pages and all. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"This is a must-read! Galsworthy's writing is outstanding. Also read the sequel to the Saga -- &quot;A Modern Comedy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"As stated in other reviews, \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" actually consists of three books and two short stories (or \\"interludes\\" since they are placed in between the novels). Written over a span of more than 20 years, it makes for a rather lengthy work (850 pages). I was indeed grateful for the inclusion of a family tree, because there are numerous Forstyes and their spouses to keep track of. Galsworthy writes in a highly detailed manner such as when describing a character's furniture or garden. In fact, if I could make one criticism, at times, I think each of these books dragged because Galsworthy became too bogged down on some meticulous description of plant life or the like. Sometimes the reader just wants the action (Anthony Trollope, I think, had a better sense of proportion regarding driving plot as opposed to describing surroundings).Nevertheless, I would still call \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" classic British literature because of the author's prodigious skill in creating characters together with the details that surround their lives. Obviously, Galsworthy had some central themes on his mind, especially the never ending struggle between wealth and property verses art and beauty. Or, if you will, realism verses idealism. Galsworthy is no naif though: he understands that without benefactors art can't survive. He also has some rather strong views about art itself - for instance, he mocks much of modern art (through the \\"lame ducks\\" of June). But the representatives of the central struggle are Irene/Joylon/Jon vs. Soames/James/Fleur. With Soames, we have, perhaps, one of the most memorable characters in all of English literature.I found some of the characters a bit unrealistic and dry (to compare with Trollope again, the latter had a much better sense of humour). As far as specific plot complaints, I can almost guarantee that a person like Irene would not be happy with Jolyon, nor make such a good loving mother. The relationship between Irene and her son Jon was a bit too Freudian for my tastes. Plus, in the most dramatic section of the saga, the final novel, I kind of thought that Jon, someone whom I think the author wants us to admire, becomes the quitessential milksop. But, overall, if you, like me, enjoy 19th and early 20th century English Literature, I highly recommend \\"The Forsyte Saga.\\""},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word &quot;ficbe&quot; came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"\\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is a monumental masterpiece reaching the highest level of narrative skills and literary beauty.Mostly known for the television adaptation, this heck of the book is no less amusing than BBC Masterpiece Theater, even more... it surpasses television genre in what it's always appreciated by the readers - art of the written language.Despite its length, events which are taken place in the lives of three generation of Forsytes, are hugely engaging and elegantly placed in the background of Victorian and post Victorian era, wonderfully described by the author. For that reason I didn't have any problem to \\"travel\\" through the book pages without slightest feeling of boredom or exhaustion from reading.As a reader it is so easy to quickly befriend some of the main characters, as well as find almost personal grudges toward less amiable personalities like unimaginative, solicitor Soams (\\"Man of the Property\\"), who's obsession with acquiring goods, degrades even his wives to the level of material assets. In the first group I would definitely include the Old Jolyon, for whom John Galsworthy dedicated entire interlude between first and second part of the book, and which is one of the most charming and poetic sequence in the novel.I found Galsworthy narrative to be extremely clever, elegant, observant, poetic, up to the point of the highest level in art. The only sadness which I feel is that many times I found this beautiful literary creation, to be underrated and not included in the list of \\"must read books\\" of 20 century."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"\\"Was there anything, indeed, more tragic in the world than a man enslaved by his own possessive instinct, who couldn't see the sky for it, or even enter fully into what another person felt!\\" This has to be my favorite line of the whole book which was thought by young Jolyon Forsyte about his tragic cousin Soames. It also sums up what the entire long family saga is about, possessions whether they are tangible or human. This book is so brilliant because it has a little bit of everything including family secrets, adultry, forbidden love, gambling, and scandal. It almost sounds like a soap opera but is only so much better. Another brillant part of the book is the fact that all the characters are so human none of them are perfect and each has their own set of flaws. At first I didn't think I was going to like the fact that there was no real hero but I have to say that it makes for some interesting reading. Another thing I liked about Galsworthy's writing of the book is that readers never really know what Irene is thinking, the only interpretations you get from her are what other characters give you. This makes her as elusive as she is described in the book. You either are going to love her or hate her. I found myself hating her at the beginning of the novel because I pitied poor Soames for receiving no love from her but by the time the interlude had occured, I found myself liking her more, especially because of her treatment of Old Jolyon. I started hating and piting Soames more and more, even his own daughter dislikes him. If you like LONG invloved novels with detailed descriptions about time and places you will love this book. It is really one of the great works of the 20th century and I think this author was way before his time. I look forward to reading the other two novels about the Forsyte family in he future."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"Galsworthy's \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is simply masterful. A society epic, a romance, a satire, a character study, and a concept examination (of the effects of beauty on people's lives), the Forsyte Saga tells many stories but centers on the tragic marriage of Irene and Soames. Irene has married Soames under duress from her stepmother, and she detests him. Soames views all things in his world as possessions, including Irene. The tragedy of this marriage begets more tragedies among other characters who swirl into and out of the narrative. Other, unrelated tragedies in the Forsyte family dovetail with Irene and Soames's as we come to know a great number of aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and cousins. But \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is not all heavy; many of the characters are terribly funny (what could be better than senile aunties?), and Galsworthy's comments on society are acutely witty. Galsworthy draws his characters so superbly that when the books first came out, readers wrote to him claiming that he must have based characters off of acquaintances of theirs. Galsworthy's prose is elegant, fluid, and sparkling with energy, making \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" beautiful and very readable, despite its heft."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"A magnificent sage about a family at the end of the Victorian period. Following several generations of this family as they cavort through society, Galsworthy is a master of storytelling. Although this book is long, you won't be bored, because the action is faced-paced and exciting; Galsworthy can read his characters like a book, so to speak, and presents the Forsyte family as they really are. While Galsworthy postdated the Realism movement in literature, his style is very much reminiscent of those authors in that he depicts everything as it really is: no makeup, no glossing over the dirty facts of life.At the heart of this big, beautiful book are three novels, plus two smaller stories in between. The Man of Property, In Chancery, and To Let discuss the major aspects of the Forsyte Saga- staring with Jolyon Forsyte, the patriarch of the family, then Soames and Irene Forsyte in the 1880's, and leading up to the 1920's. The two interludes, Indian Summer of a Forsyte and Awakening are smaller, but no less important parts of this tragicomic saga of a family as it rises and falls with the times.I haven't seen the film production, but I can't wait to see it, if it is in fact as good as I've heard it to be."},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"The Forsyte Saga will keep you on the edge of your seat! I couldn't put this down until I was finished with it. I had seen part of the PBS Masterpiece Theater on it (how I heard about it), but still did not expect what came next!"},{"Title":"The Forsythe Saga","review":"John Galsworthy (never \\"Sir John\\" only by his own choice, though he did accept the Order of Merit), one of the notable British writers of the first quarter of the 20th century, has subsequently faded somewhat from the canon of British writers in the 20th century, despite his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. Galsworthy was a very traditional Victorian/Edwardian writer in his style, despite making his books social criticisms of Victorian/Edwardian values; his best work coincided with the rise of artistic modernism, which has tended to overshadow his more traditional approach. \\"The Forsyte Saga\\", a collection of three novels linked by two short stories, is Galsworthy's magnum opus, and has been twice adapted by the BBC into major miniseries (first and most famously in 1967, and again in 2002); it has lingered moreso in the public consciousness than its author. This large volume collects the entirety of the original quintology (some spoilers follow).The first (and, originally planned to be the only) novel in the series, \\"The Man of Property\\", was published in 1906, and set in the high Victorian period, focussing on the Forsyte family, the numerous long-lived sons and daughters of Jolyon 'Superior Dorset' Forsyte, and their own descendants. There is Old Jolyon ('Superior''s eldest son), who has estranged himself from his son Young Jolyon for the latter's scandalous affair, and has raised his daughter June, who is engaged to an architect; and Soames Forsyte, the son of Jolyon's brother James, who is married to Irene, and commissions the architect to build a house that he hopes will help revive the passion in his relationship with Irene.Galsworthy's twin focuses, which carry on through the whole series, are the strictures of Victorian values of commerce and proper behaviour (which particularly impact the two Jolyons), and the subordinate legal position of women in society (though the ridiculous divorce laws also hamstring men, as we later see). These carry on through the subsequent novels, published more than a decade after, and the two short stories (the second short story, \\"Awakenings\\", is honestly pretty throwaway, but \\"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\\" is lovely). Galsworthy's writing style is eminently restrained; Soames' decision to force himself on his wife Irene near the climax of the first novel is only described briefly in a single paragraph, and the nature of this act is never verbalized (or even narrated) by anyone for almost the entire remainder of the trilogy, even though it is absolutely essential to understanding what's going on. Stiff upper lip, indeed. The characterization really sells the story; the plots are frequently not anything to write home about (the third novel even opens with a quote from \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", which would tell people in fair detail how the entire main storyline will play out, until the very end, which is more muted).Recommended."},{"Title":"Men at War","review":"'Men at War' is a compendium of war stories edited by Ernest Hemingway. Most of the stories are historical or first-person accounts of actual events. Hemingway has selected the tales for their literary quality, insight and experience of war. He starts with Caesar's invasion of Britain; William the Bastard's 1066 invasion of England; American Civil War accounts and much, much more. He's even included his fictional--but excellent--\\"fight on the hilltop' from \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" A must read for Heminway fanatics."},{"Title":"In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age","review":"This book tackles international computer system threats that face nations and corporations head on. It presents a theoretical framework for action and will be a valuable resource for the next decade.Athena was also a serious topic in ancient times when she was the Greek god with a sword and shield, the one who thought up the first Trojan horse... a legacy that connects well with today's netwars.The authors of each chapter address different issues. Most are from the perspective of military issues. Many use clear historic perspectives to show how one side or the other lost conflicts, for example, the use of smart networks by Mongols to defeat Muslims and by Ho Chi Minh against Lyndon Johnson. Other examples are drawn from the gulf war; the chief of which is that the next opponent will likely not be as dumb as Saddam.Oddly there isn't much in the book about China and Russia, the cyber-bullies of today's world. Even if one did want to look up material on these countries the missing index prevents it. With a new abbreviation on every page it would also be helpful to have a Rosetta stone inside the back cover.The example of the wild west is used and very applicable here. There are only isolated pockets of law and order. Good and bad guys are hard to distinguish. Outside occasional enclaves good guys can only trust their resources and a few friends. This high level discussion can be directly translated to domains, firewalls, and virtual private networks. It argues against lowest-bidder security implementations.Computer network managers will understand diminishing role of government in the direction of commercial systems. This means less traditional compliance-driven security technology will be available. Corporate security, network administrators and infrastructure managers are out there on their own. &quot;Street smart&quot; information behavior will be necessary to survive.Through the book the term &quot;cyber&quot; is overused. It almost never appears in serious government discussions or commercial security where the emphasis is on all aspects of network issues.Security managers who want a superficial self improvement should skip this book. It is very concept-dense and filled with ideas which will cause the reader to stop and think about strategy. Few solution specifics are presented. Concepts in this book are suited for someone who is developing a strategic vision for protecting their organization from network attacks.[adapted from a review published in Security Management.

I used the book in a term paper I wrote for political sciences, in which I examined the coming threats in context with the momentary policy of the german government (as I am German and studying here). The book was of utmost importance to me in this case, as it is, as far as I know, the only book covering this topic on such a high level of quality at the moment. Further research also revealed to me, that the momentary german policy is utmost abysmal, and that, surprisingly, the German Green Party, B&uuml;ndnis 90/ Die Gr&uuml;nen, would maintain the best policy in case of election (just for your information).

Indian Villages is the only major book that traces back Indian names and places for their correct form, origin and history. These 290 pages are filled with the most incredible collection of information ever assembled on the Indian place names of Pennsylvania. In researching his book, Mr. Donehoo, not only went over every available source of printed material about place names in Pennsylvania, but also walked over nearly every Indian trail, from the Delaware to the Ohio, using every trader's journal and maps as his guide. Each Indian name comes complete with historical notes by the author, and as you read, you get a sense about each place; a feeling of walking with the author through each early village, along every river and stream and across the mountains of Pennsylvania back into time. A list of the authorities used is given with each name and a general bibliography follows at the conclusion of the work. Certainly, Heckwelder, Zeisberger, Post, Gist, Croghan, Weiser and other early explorers would be very proud."},{"Title":"Indian villages and place names in Pennsylvania","review":"Not willing to pay that much, sorry.

I have used it very successfully so far, with significant positive changes in my life, both health, career and relationship wise. The monthly predictions for the house we are currently in have been uncannily accurate.What is most useful as well is the author's judicious recommendations which have not only helped bring forward good luck (and suppressed bad luck) but have also helped beautified my house. For example, after following the recommendations to activate my career luck, I have just received another job offer! They are truly testament to her experience and knowledge.I find it sad that people whinge and pick about minor details (and blow it out of proportion). If your house was built in the 1920s, sure .. the charts don't apply but it does not take much effort to change the period of your house (and the author recommends ways to do this as well!!!).My house was built in the late 70s but we have successfully changed the period of the house (given the accuracy of the predictions) with minimal effort and cost ....I look forward to the 2003 book with anticipation!!!"},{"Title":"Lillian Too's Feng Shui Year 2002","review":"Ms Too has tackled a subject that is immensely difficult to learn.

YOU COULD DO NOTHING WORSE! This book deserves FULL attention, and it is great for beginners and experienced numerologists alike. I use it more for a reference book when I do readings for others, and it helps immeasurably. It is very colourful, and very informed. Teaches you how to use numbers in everyday life, what your birthdate means, what your name means in numbers, what the vowels in your name mean etc. etc. etc. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIMPLE YET HIGHLY ACCURATE BOOK FOR NUMEROLOGY, THIS IS IT.

In several decades nothing has. In my mind it's still the one text that covers in a very basic way all the essential aspects of conducting choral music. It includes rehearsal techniques, gives voice instruction guidelines, and focuses on performance practice for each major style period in the western tradition. It even has diction charts for all the major choral languages. There are other excellent texts (which I also use in other courses) that cover a few areas of choral music-making in greater detail, but if you need one text to introduce students to the main topics in clear and authoritative language, this is still the one."},{"Title":"The Choral Experience: Literature, Materials, and Methods","review":"It won't make you a good choral conductor or teacher just by reading books.

He will faithfully do according to His Word the moment you have chosen positively to rest your salvation in His saving power and grace alone. After you have thus believed, he purposes to supply all the enabling power to meet all the problems and the needs of your daily life. You need not fear, only believe His Word. His wisdom, strength and bounty are sufficient for you. -117That is how the final chapter of Lewis Spery Chafer's classic book Salvation: God's Marvelous Work of Grace begins. The book, as the final chapter is called, is an appeal for the sinner to come to Christ and to embrace the gospel. This classic is an evangelistic in its nature, but it certainly is not a track where the gospel is over-simplified. Instead, the theologian walks the reader through every basic aspect of the gospel from sin to the cross to the atonement to the resurrection to redemption to the sinner's response to the believers benefits to the assurance of salvation to eternal salvation and to our final destination.Chafer pounds the pages with Scripture references. He helpfully provides a Scriptural index in the back of the book which reveals just how prevalent the Bible is in this book. Oftentimes Chafer will state and thesis and essentially list a number of passages that defend his argument.There were many moments where I was shouting, \\"Amen!\\" In the third chapter of the book Chafer deals with those who challenge the doctrine of penal substitution. It reads as if he were writing today. He points out the empty rhetoric of his day and ours that suggests that the cross makes Christ a victim of an abusive, vindictive Father (the cross is \\"divine child abuse\\" for example). Chafer rightly condemns and corrects any notion of immorality in believing in substituionary atonement.Though there were many Amens, there is one section in particular that highly disappointed me. Chafer was a leading voice in the Lordship controversy that argued that one only needs to believe, but not repent. This is not the place to fully lay out everything regarding the Lordship controversy of a few decades ago. However, Chafer dedicates a large section of one chapter to this issue. He painstakingly suggests and tries to defend the notion that repentance is not necessary for salvation. His argument is weak. One is hard pressed to read the Old or the New Testament without seeing that God demands repentance from His children.Overall, however, this is a great book. Though I have some reservations in certain sections, this is an extremely helpful book in laying out the gospel. Although I would not put it into the hands of a lost person for various reasons, it is a helpful guide to those who might be considering embracing the gospel and also to believers who need to hear that message again (and we all need to daily!). If you can get by the Lordship issue (and that is an important issue to say the least), this is an excellent read.This book was given to me courtesy of Kregel Publications for the purpose of this review."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"I've read them all, many times over and am a big fan.

L'Amour has woven that story into this tale of parallel worlds and mysterious places to create a western that isn't your ordinary shoot-em-up. Like most of L'Amour's female characters, the two women in this one are strong and intelligent and they help the men accomplish something. I always think that this book and \\"Haunted Mesa\\" are almost companion pieces; this one of parallel worlds during the time of the Old West and \\"Haunted Mesa\\" of the same thing in modern times. An interesting book by a master of the art of storytellling."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"This one doesn't really fall into the Western category, but it's full of hammering action, informative local California history, and mystic goings-on. Seacoast adventures, early Califronia ranching, great good-guys and really bad bad-guys, and mysterious appearances by silent, unknown characters fill this one to the brim! Best of all, L'Amour introduces in this story, for what I believe was the first time in his writings, the famous &quot;portal to the other side,&quot; which really sets this story apart from almost all of his other works. Excellent yarn through and through. You won't forget it for a long time after you first read it!"},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"I have read fourteen books of Louis L'Amour's writings and this one happened to be one of the best books I read. It's different, and keeps you wondering about what's goin' to happen next, and in the end leaves you with a big smile drawn upon your face!. If you haven't read The Californios, then you'd better go get it! It's one of his finest writings! I usually keep my books on a shelf but I stored this one among my most-loved possessions! Louis L'Amour is by far the greatest storyteller, and this is how he's going to be remembered until the end of time!."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"overall, The Californios was a good historical western story, and one of the best westerns i've ever read. the book was set in the 1800s in southern California and Mexico, and used realstic details and events from that time period to add to the plot. it had the perfect cowboy setting - canyons, deserts, mountains, horses, Indians, and outlaws. it also involved things that were happening in the 1800s, including immigration and dispute between Mexico and the US. throughout the book, the author uses these to relate to his characters and makes the suspense of the story a lot better. The Californios has all the basic western themes too - adventure, gunfights, treasure hunting, bandits, and old wise men. it even involves spirits and mystical events to beef up the mystery."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"L'Amour masterfully describes the beautiful California scenery, the situations, and the characters, as he unfolds the plot in his reader's mind's eye. Included in this mix is the ever-present set of challenges facing the protagonists. As one of his characters says in this novel, \\"there is always trouble. One learns to live with it. A man grows through enduring.\\" A few chapters over one of his characters observes \\"men must struggle or they deteriorate.\\" Which leads to the addition of philosophy or worldview, another component of L'Amour's works. I agree with some of his sermonizing, i.e., issues such as a strong work ethic and bravery. I strongly disagree when he tries to subtlely preach acceptance of mysticism which is anti-Christian. Moving back to a more positive matter, L'Amour inserts elements of human relations in his works. For example in talking about Mariana visiting with Sean in this book he notes \\"she listened more to the man than to the words.\\" In synergistically observing people and location, he notes how one impacts the other by writing \\"in New England and in northern Europe the seasons were short and the air brisk. One had little time to do what needed to be done. In California the seasons merged, dreamed one into the other, and what was not done today could be done tomorrow.\\" If taken in context, i.e., specifially if one ignores his advocacy of anti-Christian spiritualism, he has a colorful, adventure story of the old West to tell."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"I often wonder why someone like Steven Speilberg never cared to read such literary talent...I re-read Californios in my late twenties and wondered if SS could make a movie out of this. It would probably become every kid's fantasy in the truest sense of the word if only every word of this book is translated using computer graphics...recall that JAWS and ET were runaway blockbusters that dealt with a shark and an extra-terrestrial as such.

As usual, there is action, light romance, and suspense. However, \\"The Californios\\" has a mystical side that has similar elements as L'Amour's book \\"The Haunted Mesa.\\" Overall, the book is fantastic and one both L'Amour fan, and those new to his writing, will enjoy.The story is about a man trying to help his mother keep her ranch. As she owes money to a scoundrel who would rather own her land, they are in a predicament. Years ago, her husband went into the desert with a man called the Old One, the last of an ancient people, and returned with gold. Now, they believe finding the Old One may help them again.\\"The Californios\\" is an amazing book worth reading. You will learn about life in the early 1800s California without trying. Perhaps the most enjoyable part was the philosophical statements and the mystical elements sprinkled throughout the book. Furthermore, the book peaked my interest in learning more about ancient people who were in America before the Indians. To top it off, the suspense runs from the beginning to end and is truly exceptional reading."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"A fairly decent read, the \\"Californios\\" allows readers to step into the diverse story including sailing and backcountry soul searching. In the story, I felt that L'Amour mixed in an interesting mix on his usual cowboy backdrop by placing an exotic take on the ancient humans of pre-indian California. With this in mind, I believe this book is a good read for anyone who has read a few of ole Louis' books and want to see a slight change in his gun slinging plots."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"Another good Louis L'Amour book but kindle edition had more typos than the book formats I have read and I have read this many times."},{"Title":"The Californios","review":"Just another of Louis Lamour's fantastic westerns.

Showalter's research is thorough, and her presentation of information shows a care and attentiveness to her material that increases the confidence of the reader. Drawing on a cultural sangria of material, The Female Malady traces the systematic (and often blundering) treatment of mental disease, focusing on how women influenced the establishment as not only patients, but commentators in the form of employees and writers, activists and advocates.The majority of the text focuses on the plight of the Victorian woman, and how doctors and the medical profession responded to what they perceived as the nervous energy attached to the rising discontent of women as a gendered class. However, the text does not end there, and moves on to discuss everything from evolving practices in institutions, the feminization of mental disease, the presence and treatment of male patients, psychoanalysis, and the feminist therapy movement. Showalter skillfully blends historical observation and study with careful literary analysis to give her reader and understanding of the material from several angles and increase their awareness of the historical implications of insanity not just for the evolution of women, but for the sciences and literary fields alike. At just 250 pages, The Female Malady is by no means a complete history, but proves to be a useful volume on its own, especially for those considering cultural and literary implications of insanity beyond the straight-forward studies of psychology or psychoanalytic theory."},{"Title":"The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for Nonfinancial Managers","review":"Robert Cooke use humor throughout the book to help nonfinancial manager understand financial reports.

I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a business, is thinking of owning a business or just wants to better understand what the finance world looks like from the outside.It takes a black-box perspective on the subject to avoid dragging the reader into all the minute details while still giving the reader plenty to chew on, like COGS, depreciation, lease vs. buy decisions, and inventory valuation. The intent of this book is not to teach the reader to be an accountant but rather a book to teach the businessperson how to better use accounting as a tool so they can be more effective.And I *love* to use of the example small business of Rosie's Spouse Houses to tie each accounting concept directly to specific \\"real-world\\" situations. The great use of humor really helps break up what can be a relatively unpalatable topic.The only place this book falls a little short (but for good reason - it's already a long book!) is on financial statement analysis. For that, I'd recommend the book \\"How To Read a Financial Report\\" by John A. Tracy.I have (and will continue) to recommend this book to my friends who own small businesses."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins","review":"This book is both an exhibtion catalogue to a show Derrida curated at the Louvre of drawings on the theme of blindness (complete with many reproductions of works) as well as a brillant investigation into the art of drawing by dealing with blindness as evidence of 'blindness' itself in every act of looking (and of course reproduction). As stated by Derrida, &quot;every drawing of 'the blind' is a drawing 'of' the blind.&quot; More than just an example of applied deconstruction, Derrida's reading of these drawings questions the very foudnation of western ideologies of 'looking' and 'seeing' taken for granted as self-evident by artists for centuries. By the end, one wonders who is the author, the artist, the curator?, as Derrida does more with these drawings 'for drawing' than they ever did for drawing themselves. This book is a necessity for any visual artist producing critical work in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins","review":"Although Derrida can be difficult to follow sometimes, this work is extremely intriguing and thought provoking. Well illustrated as well, as should be expected considering it was the catalogue for an exhibition."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins","review":"Here Derrida offers a vision of blindness, that is to say a \\"vision\\" of \\"blindness\\", or even a \\"vis\\"ion of \\"blind\\"ness. By deconstructing the very \\"act\\" of see\\"ing\\", he defers to diff&eacute;rance, grammatology, and \\"&eacute;perons\\", that is to say, the \\"spurs\\" by which we harry, that is to say hurry, the horse(s) of structuralized condescension. Perception, that is, or \\"interception\\", or even \\"interperception\\" of vision--or more precisely, visuality, and all that implies. Reading, and re-reading, this book, we can easily understand why Derrida and his thought were so instrumental in the fall of apartheid."},{"Title":"The natural history of nonsense,","review":"This should be required reading for any critical thinking course. It is a handbook against irrational thought, so-called \\"common sense\\", and a host of other misconceptions of humankind. Though written in 1946, it is still relevant today, if not more so, since so many of us seem to have lost our collective mind.Fun reading, witty, and smooth, it is a great book to revisit from time to time.

I understood what recursion was by definition, but I couldn't construct a recursive function, nor could I spot a pattern that could be defined recursively. With no exaggeration, I had a glorious moment while reading this book when I finally truly understood recursion. It hit me, that epiphany finally came, and my eyes grew wide with excitement as I stepped into a whole new world.This book shows you how to structure your thoughts, and how not to get lost in recursion. After reading this book, I began to wonder how my computer science teachers were so awful at teaching this concept. Recursion is powerful and beautiful. If you're wanting to take your programming to the next level and finally understand recursion, this book does just that."},{"Title":"Woodcraft","review":"This is one of my favorite reads on survival skills in the outdoors.

He writes very well indeed. These 13 stories, mainly about first-generation Jewish immigrants in America, but also about visitors to Italy from America, capture so much of life in a society where one is an outsider---that feeling of \\"being here but not here\\", or of living in a country, but not belonging. The wasted ex-coffee salesman, the harassed landlord, the loner rabbinical student, they all seem to pulsate with failure, with uncertainty, and fatal mistakes. Ah, this is a book about life all right, but it's a book in which the vision is almost tunnel vision. Every single story, without exception, deals with people who cannot rise to their own imaginations of themselves. They meet frustration, failure, death or disappointment, they are deflected from any purpose they might have once had. They are melancholy shades of fruitless endeavor. Does even one reach his ambition ? (They are all male.) No, the student doesn't find a house in Rome, the would-be art critic abandons his research, the would-be lover lies about his Jewish origins and loses the beautiful girl, the buyer on credit never pays back, the so-called reader never reads, the shoemaker allows his daughter to marry an unsuitable man. Only once, after humiliating an angel to tears, does an old man admit his mistake and save his wife from death, and this occurs in the only fantasy among the thirteen. Most of the characters lose, their labors come to naught, they grow wiser, but sadder. I would assume that Malamud himself felt an outsider everywhere, comfortable nowhere. If that is not true, his dreams must have been filled with worry, because this is a most melancholy collection. Does anyone smile ? Does anyone laugh ? Does anyone dash down the street radiant with love ? No. Life is full of personal shortcomings, a bald spot, a stubborn rejection of family, an inability to swim or make money. Frustration and lies run rampant--people certainly do shoot themselves in the foot again and again. Life is a tragedy, life always ends in disappointment-these are truths told in half the literature of the world, but there is more to our humble existence than that. Even when Malamud writes a humorous story, it is filled with underlying doubt in human nature, concentrating on the tendency of people to try to be what they are not. If you want thirteen superb stories to illustrate that sad point of view, here they are. If you think life is more of a mixed bag, then perhaps this book will only depress you."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"'The Magic Barrel' by Malamud contains several (mostly) entertaining short stories involving Jewish (/Yiddish) characters from the 1950s. He captures a culture and way of life today's generation has no memory of. Although well written I cannot quite understand why this book would receive any special accolades.Bottom line: certainly a good read but not the sort of book worth searching for unless one has a special interest in Jewish/Yiddish American life. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot; was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is &quot;sad,&quot; that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"I was looking for a hard to find book in large print. I was shocked to see that they were selling a new edition for about $1.57. I was skeptical but for the price took a chance and was amazed to find that I received exactly what was described in perfect brand new condition. The delivery time was also very, very fast. I'll check out their WEB site in the future for more extraordinary values.Craig Heard, New York, NY"},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"I selected the complete short stories of Malamud and this book is only a selction of short stories. I was disappointed but we decided to keep it and be more careful in ordering."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"I would suggest before sitting down to read this book that you brew a large pot of coffee. Or better yet, don't sit down to read it at all. This is dry stuff!"},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"It was such a pleasure to read these stories. Each story grabs you quickly, and makes its narative thrust accessible. His stories don't stray from his simple narratives; there is very little excess or digression.The stories are very personal and moral without being preachy. He knows how to capture people's moral ambivalence without judging them or resorting to stereotypes.I found this book to be both an easy read and very moving."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"Since this book won the 1959 National Book Award, and I had not read it, I found a copy and was amazed at the power of the stories. I usually am not too enamored of short story collections, since I don't appreciate starting anew every few pages in a book. But this book is an exception. I was amazed at how quickly one became caught up in each story. The first story is The First Seven Years, and is a most touching story, setting the reader up most felicitously for enjoyment of each of the following 12 stories."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"This set of stories surprises one with breadth of understanding which it exhibits. From the first story (&quot;The First Seven Years&quot;) which deals with a father's desire to provide the best for his daughter through the last story (&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot;)which provides an interesting contrast to the first, all of these stories expand on the single theme of human experience.The frustration built upon in &quot;The Key&quot; and &quot;The Last Mohican&quot; if offset nicely by the humor in &quot;A Summer's Reading&quot; and &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;. &quot;Take Pity&quot; and &quot;The Mourners&quot; offer great insigth into growing old and dealing with lonliness. While &quot;Angel Levine&quot; is probably the most off beat of the set it still manages to increase hope, whereas &quot;The Prison&quot; causes an equal loss of faith in the human race.The 12 stories here provide a wonderful evening's reading, however if your looking for more they are included in the books of his complete stories."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"These stories are pervaded with a certain sadness and disappointment, a sense of life as largely a trial in suffering. They are also however deep in a kind of quiet beauty, a unique language of slightly Yiddishized American colloquial restraint. The title story, and the most famous one tells of the hopes and disappointments of poor Jews seeking to find their ' bashert' their destined mate. It touches upon the world of tormented souls selling illusions to themselves and others. It really moves us with the sense of how the dreams of life turn bitterness into greater bitterness, with longing disappointment beauty. These stories are for those who are willing to read and take inspiration from the sadnesses of life, that nonetheless enrich our human meaning."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"These stories about New York, even when read fifty years later by someone like me from a totally different demographic, in Los Angeles, are still relevant. There are universal self-loathing themes for all immigrants, at all times. I wouldn't call it immigrant lit, but it's more like human diaspora lit, the transience of people, and how people make sense, however limited, of the world around them. Strongly recommend. Malamud is able to make writing about trash untrashy, but not in a falsely glorifying way, but in a humanizing way. These are real short stories, not failed novellas."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"I wasn't sure about this book but decided to give it a shot and I am so happy I did. All the stories are entertaining and well written. You never get bored. I felt like a kid again wanting to know what happens next page after page. Great writer!"},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"Flannery O'Connor is responsible for my purchase of this book. In one of her letters, she mentioned that she had justfinished reading The Magic Barrel and stated that &#34;this guy makes the rest of us look bad.&#34; (Or words to that effect;can't recall the exact quote.)Many years ago I read Malamud's &#34;The Fixer&#34; and never forgot it. Its message has stayed with me through many politicaltrials of my own. The only other book which has never been forgotten is &#34;The Arms of Krupp.&#34; Have not finished all thestories in The Magic Barrel but so far they are all wonderful. One cannot go wrong with truly gifted writers."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"This book was interesting. I feel not everyone gets these short stories.

While the first 25% of the book has a number of pages that are very, very basic, I guess Jay needs to do the CYA thing. Nevertheless, I was disappointed with this aspect of the book. Give me the joint cranks, and let me work on those. Write another book filled with Philosophy, etc., . I assure you, I will buy that one too. Don't mix the focus.As well, for people my age, there is a need for reading glasses. But reading glasses, and falling in the dojo don't go well together. So, I think that a larger book would be appropriate, e.g. 8.5\\" x 11\\". But, there are DVDs apparently. Maybe that would be better for me.As for the remaining 75%, they were filled with techniques. Unlike some other reviewers, I WANTED to see more and more techniques. They were not problematic to follow, rather easy actually. There were several panels with exceptionally close photography for some techniques, and I would judge them as being required.I was very pleased with this purchase. It has earned a permanent spot in my library - Self-Defense section. It has helped me with my learning and never ending quest to perfect my Combat Hapkido joint lock studies.VERY MUCH WORTH THE PURCHASE !!!"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I am an experienced martial artist who knows plenty of grappling,throwing,kicking,striking,blocking,falling, and joint locking techniques. I reccomend this book for beginner and intermediat practitionars of juijitsu and other grappling styles (8th to 5th kyu). If you are a blackbelt or advanced student this book will contain alot of things you already know. But this book should not be used as a learning guide and should only be kept a reference guide. You need an instructor to correct a technique you have trouble with, something a book can,t do. A great book!"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Wally Jay is the guru of all Ju-jitsu. I've studied Ju-Jitsu for 4 years and this book was a great companion to my classes. Now, I study Gracie Ju-jitsu and this book is still helpful even though the systems I've studied are different. A must for all practitioners of the art."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This is a very good book on the basics of Wally Jay's Small-Circle Jujitsu method. Remember that a book is not a teacher. Lets start with saying that the man knows his stuff and can turn even the simplest tweak of the finger into a painfully mind-numbing experience. The book has lots of easily followed photos and explanation to the techniques. Covered in the text are Preliminary exercises:the art of falling, movement and resuscitation techniques. A chapter on the weaknesses of the human body does then follow. Now techniques are explored including wrist and finger locks, arm/leg bars, arm/leg locks, throwing techniques and choker holds. The final chapter concerns us with self defense techniques.Overall I rate this book as worthwhile especially to the grappling student. One failing is that the techniques look on paper rather static and the self defence applications are very basic, but remember the basics are to be built upon and practised. The techniques shown inflict pain and fast. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Small-Circle Jujitsu is the best pocket jj book on the market and also the closest book to traditional, real, ju jutsu. The photos are good (black and white), but the quality of paper can be better (maybe in next edition). All you need for to begin train is in this book."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I found this book to be very well authored. It shows what you need to know and gives a very detailed method of teaching you the same technique. Though I think the overuse of wrist locks to be inneffective the overall method is great and proven in competition by wally jay and his students (see the history provided in the book)"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I Like this book. I think that is great for introduction to Jujitsu as well as a supplementing reference to jujitsu for one who is already practicing the martial art. The techniques covered in the book do work for appropriate situations. While no martial art is so complete as to deal with every conflict situation in which one may find oneself, Small Circle Jujitsu offers a good range of techniques to deal with many common assault scenarios. Small Circle Jujitsu Offers the defender the potential advantage of achieving control over an attacker with minimum effort and an option of not causing injury to attacker once he has been subdued. Karate, Kung Fu, and Boxing do not have these optional advantages.All the technigues are labled, described and explained in english as opposed to many other books which label techniques in Japanese. I think that this serves well the beginning student of Jujitsu who may know nothing of Japanese language or culture; but may still want to learn an efficient means of self defense. I suspect that the use of Japanese terminology in an English culture might even intimidate many prospective Jujitsu students from ever taking up the martial art simply because they cannot even pronounce the words.The book itself is divided into 5 chapters. Beginning students should pay attention to the rules of safety included towards the front of the book. This is because some of the techniques can cause serious injury.Topics covered in the book include falls, exercises, resuscitation, weak points of the body, wrist locks, finger locks, arm bars, arm locks, leg locks, throwing techniques, chokes, as well as defenses against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs.The explanations and pictures of techniques are easy to follow and understand.I think one of the things that make this book such a good value is because the reader also has the option of buying a series of videos and DVD's by the same title and author which show the student the motion and application of smooth, continous transition of techniques which cannot be captured by still pictures and explanatory text. The DVD's can be played back in slow motion which is a learning advantage in any sport. The VHS videos and DVD's can be bought from Amazon.com or direct from Black Belt Magazine at WWW.Blackbeltmag.com.Videos and DVD's can be bought separately or as a complete set. Black Belt Magazine sometimes offers the whole set of 5 VHS tapes or DVD's at the price of 4 tapes or DVD's. Look for the offer if interested.I give this book and the videos 5 each stars because it is evident that Professor Wally Jay really invested much time and effort into making sure that students will be able to understand and make use of the contents of the book and videos of Small Circle Jujitsu as a means of an efficient and effective means of self defence.Small-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 1 - FoundationsSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 3 - Grappling TechniquesSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 4 - Tendon, Tricep, Armbars and ArmlocksNihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 1Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 2Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 5Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-DefenseChin Na In Depth - Courses 1 - 4 (YMAA grappling)Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8Chin Na In Depth - Courses 9 - 12"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Great book, techniqes you can use!

Professor Jay's personal philosophy pervades this martial art. It is simple, direct, strong but effortless...like it's Grand Master. As there is no question that the techniques when applied inflict severe pain, however, it is actually how little pain is required to make an attacker yield that is the true spirit of this art. Finesse rather than raw power is the underlying greatness in Small Circle Jujitsu. Every dedicated student of any martial arts should have this book in their libary."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This book is excellent as a companion to the DVD series. Short and to the point in the text and plenty of technical demonstration pictures.

If you need a reference or teaching aid book, then you should definitely get this book."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Wally Jay's small circle Jujitsu is a must have for all Jujitsu practitionners. You do'nt have to practice the same style, but you can take ideas and concepts from Wally Jay's small circle Jujitsu and apply them to your martial arts style.Excellent book for those into Jujitsu and wrestling martial arts in general."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This book is more useful as training reference for a Small-Circle Jujitsu practioner as while the principle of the small circle is quite interesting and so is Wally Jay's history the book really doesn't cover many principals of grappling in depth.The best books to get to understand the grappling arts isThe Canon of Judo: Classic Teachings on Principles and TechniquesandTotal Aikido: The Master Course (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)as these books go into the details and strategy of grappling arts where as this book is more for advanced practioners."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"The book has great instruction and drills. It is good for those who have a solid foundation with joint locks and submissions and an overall solid grasp of the body and movement. It has given some good variations of techniques I already teach and use."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"As a Marine Corps Close Combat Instrtuctor, I can tell you that the majority of these techniques work well, and may be learned and applied by anyone. I do, however, beleive that much practical application and sparring/grappling against many different opponents is necessary to become proficient in any fighting art. Nearly ALL of the Marine Corps Close Combat techniques are found in this book. As our system was a collaboration of many SME's (subject matter experts), that has to speak for something. In addition, Wally echos one of my main points to my students, do not ever become subbornly commited to one technique. You must be able to flow from one to another based partly upon your skill, but primarily the actions of your opponent. Great book, although the pictures and descriptions could be better for beginning practitioners. If you are familiar with basic Jiu-jitsu techniques and principles, you should have no problems."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Wally Jay is an original, as well as a Hall of Fame martial arts instructor. This book must be one of the 5 or 10 best martial arts books available. It includes 11 wrist locks, 7 finger locks, 10 arm locks, 5 leg locks, 17 throws, 11 chokes, and 45 self defense moves against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs, and arm bars. The step by step explanations are clear, and the large photos are helpful. All you need is a willing partner and you are well on your way to learning Wally Jay's awesome fighting system based on a simple twist of the wrist."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"The novice may not appreciate the conservation of motion and simplicity that Dr. Jay brings to his technique of Small circle. Effortless effort! The STRENGTH of these techniques are contained in the subtle, minute changes in body position rather than brute force that seems to be the trend of the &quot;pedestrian&quot; martial artist today. If you have personally studied with Dr. Jay, you can appreciate the beauty behind these techniques.A great book to dissect over and over again."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This book should be a part of every martial artist's library. I bought it several years ago and have reviewed it several times. The techniques are practical and efficient. It really doesn't matter what style you train in, the fundamentals of this book can enhance any style. If you are a current Jujitsu or Judo student or technician, this book take techniques you may already know and increases their effectiveness. It is truly amazing what a difference a degree or two and a little push-pull action can make in a traditional technique. Wally Jay has made a wonderful contribution to the martial arts world by writing and putting this book together and sharing his years of study and research with the rest of us."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Most of us who study martial arts will never, whether we want to admit it or not, find ourselves in a life-or-death, kicking-and-punching fight. Those who do will probably only do so once or twice in a lifetime. However, much more common is the \\"tense situation,\\" where someone begins to get out of hand and you need to calm or subdue them without escalating the level of violence. When your uncle gets drunk at the family barbecue and starts horsing around, for example, you can't punch his teeth out. It just isn't done.I studied small-circle ju jitsu for several years as a suppliment to Wado Ryu karate, and I have used it to defuse several tense situations. It works well, and without any of the spiritual mumbo jumbo associated with aikido. The falling and rolling techniques are even more useful, especially if you are a skiier or a mountain biker and, like me, fall down a lot. Wally Jay's book is a great reference. The techniques are effective, the explanations are clear, and the photos are all of good quality.It should be emphasized that this is a reference, not a complete set of lessons. If you have no previous martial arts training or are not part of a dojo, you can't learn ju jitsu from any book. If, however, you are an instructor and want to suppliment your class with this material, this is an excellent sourcebook to work from."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Having praticed this form of martial art for over ten years, I have to say that anyone who understands the basic principals of jujitsu can vastly improve by reviewing this book. Loaded with simple instructions and pictures, Wally Jay makes this a quick review guide for the accomplished and an excellent instruction manual for the beginner. He has included several simple exercises, which can be done anywhere without drawing attention, which help improve certain aspects of your techniques. Having been fortunate enough to attend several classes given by this Master, I can say that the techniques are simple and quite effective in controlling an opponent."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This book is filled with technique, but most importantly, the techniques biuld on the principles presented in the beggining of the book. The small-circle idea is one of the most universaly effective in martial arts, specifically grappling. The book starts off with a short history of SCJJ, and included the principles behind it. It then goes into preleminaries, basic excersises for practicing any JJ style, really, and included breakfalls, art-specific movements, and resuscitation. The next chapter is on weak points of the body, which is an eye-opener. Who knew the cuticle was a pressure point? Prof. Jay then goes into the techniques themselves, and the specific self-defense situations. The variety of moves in this book allow you to chose the level of force you use, and all the holds/throws end in a standing possition, so that one can leave the scene, if desired. I have no real complaints about this book, although I wish the principles were explained in more detail, and most judo books can better explain the throws. Also, all the work is done in gis, so most of the throws, as presented, require a jacket, as do most chokes. This book appears written specifically with self-defence in mind, and in that it succeeds, but those involved in sporting events that use submissions will find it useful as well. Buy it for the principles and holds."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This is an excellent brief work on Prof. Jay's system. Although the book is comparatively short, at least 50 and probably more like 100 techniques are shown. Techniques are divided between throws, wrist locks, elbow locks, leglocks, and finger locks. Vulnerable areas of the body and how to attack them are shown also.Another nice feature is Prof. Jay discusses his overall theory of jujitsu and mechanical and martial principles involved, of which there are 10, which he goes into in some detail. Some of these will not be new to any experienced martial artist, such as the importance of balance, but others, such as his push-pull method of doing holds and locks, may be new.Of course one can't learn a martial art from a book, but if you have some previous knowledge, this book is an excellent introduction and/or review of many of the techniques in Prof. Jay's system. The system I practice has enough overlap so that I found this book a great way to reference and learn somemore about it. I've also had the opportunity to attend two of Prof. Jay's seminars over the years, and would like to say they were great as I expected, and it was a honor to finally meet and get to learn from such a great teacher. And he has put a lot of that knowledge into this book."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"As student who intergrates small circle in my Discipline, I would recommend this book to all martial artist. Professor Jays 10 principles and wrist techniques leave you in a AW. The finger lock techinques works wonder no matter how big or small one is. This book is a must have."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"When I began taking Small Circle Jujitsu, I looked for a good book to find out more information. I came across this book, and was quite impressed. It's no wonder, since I later learned Wally Jay founded Small Circle Jujitsu. The techniques shown in the book are not only applicable to students of Small Circle Jujitsu, but are also incredibly useful for those in other martial arts. I was so impressed by all the information from this book, I found it necessary to go to one of Wally Jay's seminars. I even bought a second copy just so I could get it signed by him. I think Professor Jay puts it best with his famous quote, &quot;Pain makes believers.&quot; If you try just one finger lock from this book, you will definately be a believer."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Having not only read the book, but personally studying with Prof. Jay and some of his students, I find the usefulness of this book great because it deals with the conflict at the beginning, instead of after being thrown on the ground by the opponent as in other styles."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I am a judoist and wanted to learn jujitsu because it teaches more ways to save yourself from dangerous situations.This book is great for all jujitsu and judo practitioners and even better for women and children.This book is easy to learn! Great pictures and directions. Prof. Jay is the best!"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This book is great! It shows several techniques using Wally Jay's Small-Circle theory that work effectively and can be learned quickly. This book is great for people who have experience in the fighting arts or for people who don't. The techniques are clearly described with easy-to-follow, step-by-step illustrations. I highly recommend this book, one of the best martial arts books I've read!!"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I became interested in learning about Jujitsu when I watched Royce Gracie for the first time in the Ultimate Fighting Championships. My interest was sparked even more when I saw Rickson Gracie's video &quot;Choke&quot;. DO NOT buy this book if you expect to learn the techniques that the Gracies use, because this is a very different style. The book does not deal with any kind of ground fighting...it is strictly stand up combat with a few throws. A lot of the moves would be very difficult to perfect without a partner to practice on, so be sure that you have someone that you can train with."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"The Small-circle of Wally Jay is a very basic book about Ju-Jitsu. As a Ju Jitsu sensei myself, I want to catalogue this book as a program for 6 to 3rd Kyu (white -yellow and orange belt)."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"No book could ever hope to be capable enough to deliver the knowledge and expertise that Professor Wally Jay holds. This book is marginal at best at attempting to impart the knowledge of such an expert as Wally Jay. The book is published in a style popular in the 1970's by karate publications, in that it is presented via numerous black &amp; white photos demonstrating techniques. The book is an acceptable text to those individuals who are already acquainted with Jujitsu and its concepts, for the novice it is somewhat more difficult to comprehend the techniques. I have attended seminars presented by Prof. Jay and know him to be one of the best martial artist living today and a great instructor with a hell of a personality. Maybe, thats why I am some what disappointed with the quality of the book, there are much better books available to those interested in martial arts, jujitsu, or self defense than this one. If you are a student of small circle jujitsu then you should own this book. I hope someday soon another more informative book is published by this truely talented and gifted instructor"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I did not find what I was looking for here. I was hoping to find an entire book on \\"Small Circle JuJitsu\\" and instead found a book that was 80-90% standard Kodenkan JuJitsu at maybe the Shodan Level and only 10-20% of what I would consider \\"Small Circle JuJitsu\\". I was 20% satisfied and left feeling empty. Maybe I just lack the experience to understand what his two books convey?

Now that I have been training a bit more and reading more I realized that this book is lacking a whole lot. I do not really recomend this book unless you can get it for free."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I would like to say that I admire any one who puts in the time and effort to learn a martial art and master it. That takes a lot of dedication and hard work. So I really have a great deal of respect for Wally Jay. Having said that though, I think small circle Jujitsu is really an ineffective grappling system. And I also think that it is no good in the street. Reading this book confirmed all of my worst suspicions about this art. Buy it only if you are looking for a good laugh and have money to burn. If not, and you actually want a good book about fighting try anything in Kid Peligro's Brazilian Jiu-jitsu series. Or go buy some Mario Sperry Vale Tudo tapes. Just don't get this book!"},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"This book does a good job of explaining in print, what Wally Jay demonstrates so well in person.

The author improved upon certain moves to make them more effective. Overall a good book."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I am proud to say that I was personally acquainted with Wally Jay thanks to the introduction by former Canadian National Karate Champion, Patrick McCarthy. Later, I was fortunate enough to have hosted several of Jay's seminars and produced an article or two about him for national martial arts magazines. Besides being a talented martial artist Wally Jay was a decent and kind man. In fact, he had once told me that if we injured our opponents in a fight then we have an obligation to take care of them. As a combat veteran and tournament fighter I had trouble with that concept then. Over the years I have come to see that perhaps that's another side of his wisdom and compassion that as an instructor he tried to pass along to those of us knuckle draggers who hadn't caught on that fighting was more than just about belts and trophies.When he was working on this book he asked if I would help out and I agreed. I had nothing really to contribute or add but was honored that he had asked. Having been in the mixed martial arts for over 40 years and written hundreds of articles for martial arts and military publications I can honestly say that Professor Wally Jay was truly one of best people I met along the way. His passing was a tremendous loss to the martial arts world but his soul and spirit live on in this book.As for those critics who think any one book will teach you to be a real fighter...well, maybe if you study what's in it and then perhaps if you will also give it 20 or so years of work on the mat fighting against good opponents from any and every fighting style or martial art."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"great as a review book - love the many pics of techniques similar to zujitsu; master zulu's re-developed style of jujitsu."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"Jay Sensei is a martial arts living treasure and his book provides a great deal of useful instruction.

Anyone who meets Professor Wally Jay can easily see how excited he is to teach his masterpiece. This book provides a good foundation into the Principles of Small Circle Jujitsu that took Professor Jay over 50 years of study and research to perfect. No secrets or mysteries just simple, efficient, and effective self-defense.

This book does have some very good techniques in it, but it is also flawed in that it doesn't tell you how to apply them on a person fighting them. As far as techniques go, there are many that would never work on a live,resisting opponent, but many many more that could be made to work. you can pick up the tech's from this book, but after you get the basic mechanics down, you'll need to get a partner and practice moves in a more real environment. IE have him react when he attacks you, don't just have him grab you and stand there like an idiot,have him grab you, then throw a punch at you, or grab you and jerk you around etc. Then you get to see what tech's can work and what can't."},{"Title":"Small-Circle Jujitsu","review":"I think this is an excellent book on self defense where you'll really need it...close up.

When a cousin gave me an Amazon gift certificate, I decided to buy a book on the martial arts. I ended up buying two books (The other book is a different approach to this topic and is the best of it's kind that I've ever seen, but it's not available at Amazon... .

Heinlein : A Reader's Companion","review":"Finally, somebody has written a truly useful book about that most important of American science fiction authors, Robert A. Heinlein. In the past, sloppy criticism and the grinding of personal axes have ruined every single attempt to produce a book discussing Heinlein's works (I have the misfortune of having read them all). Gifford has produced what has to be the groundwork for all future studies of Heinlein: a basic categorization and numbering of every single published and unpublished work in the canon, along with the insiders' story on each entry. Readable from cover to cover, or as a reference work, Gifford has also performed the one invaluable goal of every reader's companion: he's sent me back to rereading the original works, but with fresh perspectives and insights. A perfect score, after twenty years of utter failures in Heinlein scholarship. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Robert A.

Anyone with more than a very casual interest in the work of Robert A. Heinlein would do well to order this book ASAP. We can only hope that we won't have to wait another 5 years for further work in this area from Mr. Gifford. Anyone seriously interested in Heinlein may also want to check out sff.net. Mr. Gifford frequents the Heinlein oriented discussions there.

Heinlein : A Reader's Companion","review":"I fancy myself quite knowledgeable in Heinlein's works yet I learned a tremendous amount in just the first five minutes flipping through this book (with many things making me chuckle--like &quot;Heinlein 3:16&quot;). Each of Heinlein's works is itemized and described, with insights about what went into its creation. There are many fascinating tidbits of information you probably wouldn't otherwise know, with inside information provided by Mrs. Heinlein, among others.The format is very readable--either straight-through, or to jump around through the book. The writing style is very clear and readable. This is a first-rate piece of Heinlein scholarship that avoids the trap of being ponderous. Well worthwhile for both the casual and serious Heinlein reader."},{"Title":"Robert A. Heinlein : A Reader's Companion","review":"This is an absolute must have for any serious Heinlein fan. Gifford obviously put a lot of work and thought into crafting the Heinlein Opus list, which provides a complete compendium of everything Heinlein has written. There are also tidbits about Heinlein work not published as well.Gifford's precise, clear, and unbiased commentary on nearly all of Heinlein's works is interesting and concise. It does a great service by providing a clear chronological progression of Heinlein as a writer, which gives the reader a fuller understanding of the works produced at a given time in Heinlein's career. I often felt nostalgic when going through commentary because I could remember the work and the period of my life that I read it, and the enjoyment that it brought me at the time.This book is indeed a companion for Heinlein fans."},{"Title":"Robert A.

Heinlein : A Reader's Companion","review":"I read the book in it's entirety the day I received it. At $24 I thought I'd be getting a comprehensive & possible critical review of each short story or novel RAH ever wrote. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the book. It's a fun read and there is a lot of information there. Just no critical review or analysis of the stories. I started reading RAH back around 1960 (early teen years) and immediately fell in love with them. He introduced me to Science Fiction and I went on to read and enjoy many other great writers. I've lost count as to how many times I have read each of his works. There is no question that RAH is the Bard of the genre. I had hoped that in this book there would have been information and a point of view that I hadn't already read or known about for all these years.However, if you are a new reader or just have read a few of his works this book can help you find some of his \\"stronger\\" works to read. But, I strongly recommend that you find (it's out of print and somewhat difficult to find) an early work entitled \\"The Past Through Tomorrow\\" which contains most of his \\"Future History\\" stories. This one I've read many times and never get tired of reading it. From very short to novel length each story is a gem. They remind me of a Beatle album in that every track is a 5 star gem.

Heinlein : A Reader's Companion","review":"From the charming opening sequence of memories from Rosemary and L. Sprague de Camp to the interesting list of Heinlein's \\"Unwritten Works\\", this volume provides a fascinating insider's look at Robert Heinlein's life and work.It purports to cover every one of Heinlein's published works ... short stories, novellas, and novels all ... and I believe that claim. If it is missing anything I would be unable to name it. The book generally assumes that the reader is a Heinlein fan and has read all or most of his work. You won't find much in the way of plot summaries here. What you will find is information about various drafts of novels, where information is available, and for these it is interesting to see how an original concept was molded into published form.There are some notes and tidbits about every work, often including information about Heinlein's inspiration for the work as a whole, or for elements used here and there in the story. Other pieces of trivia are liberally mixed in.Oddly, the author makes a number of mistakes when trying to enumerate various plot ideas. For example, when listing Heinlein works which use time travel as a device, he forgets \\"Farnham's Freehold\\". In listing books that use the surface of Venus as a location, he forgets \\"Space Cadets.\\" However, I can forgive these oversights. If nothing else, it gives the reader a chance to \\"participate\\" by knowing that you remember something about Heinlein's work that this researcher overlooked or forgot. ;-)If you haven't read at least most of Heinlein's novels and many of his short works, then this book probably isn't for you. You'd be completely lost in not knowing the context of the discussion for most of the works. Without an abiding love of Heinlein's fiction, much of this could be deadly dry.For someone like me who literally grew up reading Heinlein (I read \\"The Star Beast\\" during the first month of 4th grade, when I was nine years old, and I'm pretty sure that was the first sci-fi I'd ever read) this book is a treasure, and I wish I had happened across it long ago. I don't agree with every conclusion drawn by the author, but there are many things about Heinlein's writing that even two die hard fans will disagree about.If you haven't read a lot of Heinlein, the information in this book is not of the type to often inform you or inspire you to read particular Heinlein works. For folks like me who have devoured his every word, often many times, each page contains interesting information.Highly recommended for every Heinlein fan."},{"Title":"Robert A.

It is obviously a labor of love, but I would recommend it only for Heinlein fans who have already read most of the Grand Master's works.It basically consists of an alphabetical listing with comments on all of the published works of RAH and it appears to be quite comprehensive. Some of the remarks and anecdotes are very interesting, but virtually all of them assume that you are already familiar with the plot of the particular story or novel. This is why I recommend it only for die-hard fans. It is no help at all for the reader who has read only a couple of Heinlein's works. I think there should have been at least a basic plot synopsis for each item so those folks could have been pointed to Heinlein pieces that would have been new to them that they might have found interesting.No work, not even Starship Troopers or Strangers in A Strange Land, gets more than three or four pages of comments (most are less than a page) and the book is only about 250 pages long.

There was new information even for me on a few of the never-reprinted stories, on his non-fiction and on the background of some of the works.This book specifically takes a \\"no spoilers\\" appraoch, so no need to wait to get it until you have read them all.Since the publication of \\"A Reader's Companion,\\" the first volume of the sweeping Heinlein biographyRobert A.

Each time I re-read a Heinlein story, I flip open Gifford's book to see what he has to say about the story."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"As I read this book I was taken back in time to the coffee plantations in El Salvador. Benitez is a story teller who's style takes you far beyond the written word. The celebrations and disapointments are felt with each chapter. A powerful and vivid journey of strong and determined women throughout several decades. A novel well worth reading."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"This was a very impressive tale covering three generations of women of different classes in the history of El Salvador. Even if you have never been to that country nor know a lot of the history the story is gripping. The relations between the various women are beautifully drawn and are good and interesting enough to overcome the sometimes tedious effort to tell the history of the country. The book contains many jewels of small and simple things people do for and with each other. The letter of Caecilia at the end of the book is an example of absolute literary beauty and I will not forget that scene for a long time.In the best traditions of Isabel Allende and G.G.Marquez. A book which I not only enjoyed reading but one that I will give friends as a present."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I read with interest this book and was glued to my seat. I fell in love with the country and the characters and Benitez is a master story teller. I was a little disappointed that I did not have more information about the civil war, but if you read between the lines you will live the struggle of the Salvadorian people."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"The story was told by an experienced storyteller. The outcome somewhat predictable given the fact that tragedy struck in the very beginning. I loved the characters and found them to be believable. The political situation hasnt changed much in some of these latin countries"},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Wow, I can't believe all the great reviews this got. Although I must admit the book starts out with a bang and drew me in quickly, it quickly fizzled into a soap opera and I soon felt like I was reading a script from one of those overly-dramatic soap operas you see on Univision. I was hoping to read a novel that would provide me with some rich insight into the history of El Salvador. Instead, I was given an unoriginal family drama that could have really taken place anywhere. Although the book does use a realistic description of El Salvador as its BACKDROP, there was nothing in the writing that gave me any striking details into the economic or political history of the country or its people. Unwanted pregancies, cheating spouses, backstabbing friends, unrequited love...its all been done before. Just because it all takes place in El Salvador doesn't make it a historical novel.I also wasn't overly impressed with the writing. I guess it was technically adequate, but definatley not very sophisticated or poignant. Nothing in the book made me stop, put it down, and think. Nothing stuck with me. As a student of Spanish I also thought the author way abused the Spanish phrasing. She should learn to use it sparingly, and only when there is something deep to get across. She uses a Spanish phrase about 3 times a page and it quickly becomes seemlingly pointless. Bottom line: I could rattle-off a 100 historical novels that better than this."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. If you like novels that are vivid and descriptive, that clearly paint life of women in other countries and cultures, then this book is for you. It offers a glimpse of two very different families in El Salvador - rich coffee plantation land owners and peasant coffee pickers/servants. I specifically liked how Benitez had the action and every day life ~ with joy, sorrow, love, births, deaths ~ take place in the context of major historical events. I loved how the \\"telenovela\\" and its characters took on a life of their own. Anyone who has visited a Latin American country can vouch that they can really take a whole nation by storm! (Just think, how many people in America were waiting to see which David won American Idol?!) As a person of Salvadoran descent it served as middle-age introduction to the tumultuos and rich history of the country and it left me longing to learn more and reconnect with my roots."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"It has been a while since I read this book (maybe two months), but I just wanted to add to the body of reviews that if you love Latin American fiction or books that might read like the old Masterpiece Theater productions, you'll probably enjoy reading this book, and otherwise you'll probably be bored to tears. The writing is not very sophisticated, as is covered by others. Actually, given the quality of the book, I'm surprised by the number of reviewers! Many better books even in latin american fiction like Belli's The Invisible Woman have far less coverage. However, if you are thinking of buying the book to be well read in this genre(or if you want something specifically on El Salvador), you won't do wrong."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book since it came so highly recommended by a trusted book catalogue. On the positive side, the book gives an interesting account of the historical struggle between the rich coffee plantation owners and the uprising of the poor Indian workers. However, the author fails, in my opinion, in developing her characters beyond the superficial, and thus I remained uninvolved for the most part and detached from all the human tragedies. In summary, Ms Benitez had a wonderful premise for a story, and the history and description of El Salvador are enlightening and in part very beautiful, but the plot and characters ultimately remain shallow and mimick the sub-plot soap opera."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. It captured me from the beginning."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I wish I had more time to write a review worthy of this book! I will say that this book is fulfilling and rich read. The stories of the women and their families in this book provide insight into the contrast of the social classes in El Salvador in times past. The very personal stories allow the reader to connect with the characters while learning a great deal about the history of El Salvador from the 1930's on."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Bitter grounds, coffee, a harvest many of us crave and one who many in the land of the Savior or El Salvador depend upon as Sandra Benitez tells us in her three generation saga, Bitter Grounds. This richly textured American Book Award Winner, is a sort of rich man, poor man, upstairs, downstairs, set in El Salvador from 1932 through 1977.It is a compelling read and Sandra Benitez grabs the reader and transports her to El Salvador with the first sentence:\\"The parakeets ascened in a rustling roar of wings from the amate and primavera trees. Chattering rowdily, they hailed the rising sun. They flew toward the southern sea cresting in a line of shimmering foam tha broke and then evanesced along the black volcanic shore. The birds wheeled, banking in a long graceful turn before heading back over the forest they had roosted in; they soared toward breakfast in maicillo fields twenty kilometers away. Jabbering, the birds glided and dipped over the alluvial plain furrowed by rivers and streams coming down from the highlands. Across the plain, they trailed a hasty shadow over squares of cattle ranches and rectangles of scattered farms; they sailed past the spot where four hundred years before, don Pedro de Alvarado and his conquistadores defeated the mighty arm of the Pipil. But such a victory exacted its toll for in the fierce skirmish, Alvarado took an arrow in the leg, a wound from which he would never recover.\\"And that wound to the leg portends the history of the characters which inhabit Bitter Grounds. Sandra Benitez fleshes out her heroines of each generation, Elena and Mercedes, Magda and Jacinta and Florencia and Maria Mercedes. All are strong and vulnerable, wise and foolish and all are haunted by decisions that will shape their paths and those who follow them.The familiar structure of the family saga worked well to bring an understanding of the mid-twentieth century history of El Salvador. Sandra Benitez, skillfully fleshed out the intricacies of the culture, the economy and social structure of the country for a reader unfamiliar with it can gain understanding and insight, while at the same time entertaining with a wonderful story. She infused her story gracefully with small elements of magic realism which inhabit many books by Latin American authors.I would not hesitate to pick up another book by this author."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"After reading this book I knew I needed to share it. So I shared it with a friend, who shared it with a friend, who shared it with a friend. . . and I have now bought my fifth copy as I still want to share this, and those who read it want to share it as well.A wonderful story of 3 generations of women. Their stories are ones you will want to share with the universe.Buy it. Read it. Share it."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Having cherished A Place Where the Sea Remembers, I was eager to read Bitter Grounds and glad that it was so much longer. I was not disappointed. This is a powerful book, reminiscent of In the Time of Butterflies by Julia Alvarez, yet still a story that stands on its own. To say I was moved is an understatement. The lives of Benitez' characters are once more irrevocably intertwined and fascinating as they face the challenges of a life in El Salvador in times of military and political injustice. The strength of Benitez' women is exemplary. I highly recommend this book, one from which I take another set of priceless friends. Brava!"},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I have just finished reading this book not 20 minutes ago and I can not see a day in the future where the story will be forgotten. My heart is aching and the book moved me to tears. The characters are a permanent part of me now and I haven't been able to sleep well the past few nights as I read this book. The story will haunt you especially when you remember that though it is fiction it is very much based on true happenings such as la mantaza and the civil war.El Salvador is a beautiful country with many man-made conflicts and the book depicts that as true and honest as can be told. It opened my eyes to both sides of the conflict and told stories that many Salvadorans still hold deep down not wishing to ever speak about again."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"A very moving book, with a captivating story"},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement.

It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!"},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"&quot;Bitter Grounds&quot; starts off with a bang--the juxtaposition of a beautiful poem and the senseless murder of Jacinta's father. I naturally thought that I would be learning something about a part of the world that I know very little about. As soon as Jacinta and her mother enter the employ of a wealthy plantation owner my interest dwindled. It was like a Latin American &quot;Thornbirds&quot; with a great deal of attention given to the romances of both the wealthy and their servants, and very little to the society in which they lived; even the glimpses of life on the plantation were frustratingly brief. The writing, too, was adequate but hardly sophisticated; I was never taken by surprise by any of the language she used, or indeed, of any of the details Benitez used to describe her characters's world. This won the National Book award? It was a kitchen sink drama masking as social commentary--a type of book that I really dislike. Three stars for an interesting topic, but if it had been part of the world that I had been more familiar with, it wouldn't have gotten that much."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"This is the first book I have read by Sandra Benitez. I have done much research on the the 1932 matanza in El Salvador and some on the civil war. I am Salvadoran and began reading the book critically and from a historical point of view. It began quite slow for me and somewhat sided, but as I read on I began to feel as I knew the characters and their realities. This is an excellent book. The realities of life, love, family, death, and war are presented strongly and passionately. The ending is gripping and seems unlikely, but definately portrays the difficult times of the civil war. Read it, it will provide a fictional story of the lives of some in a war torn country."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"My bookclub decided to read this book as a follow-up to the non-fiction From Grandmothers to Granddaughters by Michael Gorkin that follows 3 generations of Salvadoran women through the civil war and into the 90's. This book was an excellent fictional follow-on. It follows the paths of 3 generations of one lower class family and one upper class family through the turbulent 20th Century in El Salvador. Benitez does not hesitate to share the gory details of Salvador's turbulent history from 1933-1977.I found the book very easy to become engrossed in, despite my dislike of violence and blood-drenched descriptions. Her descriptions of life in El Salvador are true to life in every detail. I live in San Salvador and found myself searching for &quot;Tresores&quot; or the carjacking spot on the road to La Libertad in Santa Tecla.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in what it is like to live in this country, what the Salvadoran people have experienced, or who just wants a beautiful, albeit sad, story of human survival in adversity."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"As a big fan of Sandra Benitez's A Place Where the Sea Remembers I eagerly looked forward to reading Bitter Grounds. What I found was a very different book although equally as satisfying and enlightening. As in A Place Where the Sea Remembers Sandra's intoxicating lyrical style leaves an indelible mark on you as you read Bitter Grounds. But in this story I felt myself being pulled much deeper into the lives of the families whose existence is inextricably connected to El Salvador's politics and coffee trade. Moving quickly, the story covers many miles, tragedies and celebrations and suddenly you're at the end-not quite ready to leave, and never able to forget the rich stories within the story. A wonderful journey and well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Having been born in El Salvador in the same year as Bitter Grounds' last two heroines, I can say that this book is a rarety: one which combines truth and fiction and lays bare the soul of a people caught in tragedy and turmoil. I was mesmerized by the details of life the author chronicled concerning day to day life in San Salvador and Santa Ana, by the intimate details which revealed so much about the two worlds which exist side by side in this tiny, bustling country. Coming from a family in which my father was a self made man, ultimately the highest ranking diplomat from El Salvador and in which my mother was part of the landed aristocracy of Santa Ana, I was amazed at how Ms. Benitez was able to weave so many weighty subjects into her story and yet emerge with a fable for the ages. Had I remained in El Salvador, I wonder on which side of the fence I would have landed: Maria Mercedes' or Flor's. My father's humble beginnings pulled me one way, my mother's the other. Growing up eventually in the U. S. made that choice unnecessary, but still my roots pull at me, and this book has unlocked memories I didn't even know I had.I thank Ms. Benitez for enriching my world with her novel of times that were, times that could have been, times of unrivaled tragedy and sadness. It is the story of El Salvador."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I really like the way Sandra Benitez writes. It is the first of her books I read and was nice to see the combination of reality and fiction. A fiction novel based on a reality that darkened the beautiful country of El Salvador."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Author Sandra Benitez wraps readers up tightly in the tale of a poor family and a rich family tied to El Salvador's coffee plantations, but don't get too cozy: the terrors imposed by gov't forces as well as the guerrilla soldiers lurks somewhere on the pages ahead. The story follows pairs of mothers and daughters caught between passion and politics.The author grew up in the 50s in El Salvador and was a witness to the heartbreak of illiterate women who left villages and families behind to find work in the capital. Then, in the 70s, as friends and family became targets of the growing revolution, she experienced firsthand the repercussions of oppression. This is a powerful book, one that will stay with readers long after they've turned the last page and turned off the reading lamp."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"I am always looking for hispanic women authors, and sometimes I am disappointed by their stories, but this was definately NOT the case with &quot;Bitter Grounds&quot;. I was so haunted by certain parts of the book that I kept re-reading certain sections to savor the words and the sorrow of the characters.The rich and the poor intermingle and learn from each other the value of riches that are in the heart. Wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Stories from central americal often seem surreal. How could it be that people so rich can live in such close proximity to those so poor? How could people motivated by such high principals commit such barbaric acts of violence? Insulated and liberal in America we so much want to empatize with the poor when in fact we have so much in common with the rich. I found this book so very compelling in that it provided much empathy for all sides of this conflict. One could not demonize any party. Instead I watched helplessly as the events unfolded and greived each needless loss. I recommend this book for your soul as your heart needs the exercise."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"Sandra Benitez's beautiful book, Bitter Grounds, is set in the El Salvaldor of the 1930's through the 1970's, and it protrays the lives of three generations of the privileged Tobar and Contreras families, coffee and cotton barons, and the Prieto family who serves them. Throughout the novel, the relationships of the three families intertwine as their destinies are worked out and revealed. In the eighty years that the novel encompasses, we witness the growth of unrest and eventual revolution of the campesinos against the huge land owners who enslave them with low wages and poor living conditions. We come to know with affection and sympathy members of both levels of society as their lives are joined in daily work as well as in shared confidences and joys. Two girls, Maria Mercedes and Flor, are raised together as sisters in the lovely home of the Contreras family when both Magda, the lady of the house, and Jacinta, head housekeeper, become pregnant at the same time. However, their differences in station prevent their continued closeness as one steps into the life of privelege and the other is left to follow what destiny she can make for herself. This is a book for rereading and certainly one that provides insight into the complex world of Latin America where class distinctions still remain in many areas. Thematically, the bond between women, and between mothers and daughters, is one that is universal and cross cultural. The joys and sorrows that women understand collectively and instinctively surmount any class or color barriers, and as we read Bitter Grounds, we are able to share the universal bond once again."},{"Title":"Bitter Grounds: A Novel","review":"This is a truly deep view of El Salvador's soul and the elements that pushed this tiny country into a civil war. Poor and rich are seen through the eyes of a sensible woman --Sandra Benitez-- who spent her childhood in El Salvador. It's very rich, moving and awakens social feelings. It's maybe because I am Salvadorean that I have enjoyed it so much. Still, it's a pretty good book even if all you know about El Salvador is the slanted headlines you saw in the U.S. media during the eighties. There's good and bad in El Salvador, and this is a good book to learn about what made its people go into a painful war. It's a good and entertaining read as well."},{"Title":"Doctor Dolittle's zoo","review":"Dr. Dollitle story is the first book I read, written English.Dr. Dolitle can speak animal languages.First Dr. Dollitle is a doctor for human being.But his behavior is very strange, so nobody came to his clinic.One day he speak to animal with an animal language.Many animals came to his house.After that his house is like a zoo.I like Dr. Dollitle story because of his simple sympathy to animals."},{"Title":"Combined Operations: The Official Story of the Commandos, with a Foreword by Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten.","review":"This is really a review of the seller.

Known as an iconoclast and an excellent satirist, Bierce is best known for his Devil's Dictionary. He's also known for the disappearing act he pulled in Mexico in 1913. I decided to give this short anthology a chance. If I liked his stories, I figured I'd buy some more of his writings. I will be reading more of his writings.The recent movie _The Blair Witch Project_ has brought scary stories back into vogue. After reading this book, I realized you can make a direct connection from this film to Ambrose Bierce. The connection would pass through Stephen King and H.P.Lovecraft along the way. I've seen things in both of these writers that could have been lifted directly out of one of Bierce's stories. In Bierce's story, &quot;The Damned Thing&quot;, with its talk about colors that can and can't be seen, I could have sworn I was reading Lovecraft. Bierce is a master at quick twists and shocking violence, and delivers scares fast and furious. I got chills with several of these short stories, which certainly makes for good horror reading.The book gives the reader a sample of Bierce's short stories. Most of the stories are tied around American Civil War themes, which is no surprise as Bierce served in the Union army during that conflict. His experiences gave him the necessary frame of reference to write these dark stories. And when I say dark, I mean DARK! Some of these tales will make your jaw drop. The violence in them is extremely unsettling. Chickamauga and Oil of Dog are sickening, describing blown open heads and dead babies in graphic detail.Did I mention Bierce's prose? Some of the best you'll read. His prose is so amazing that I found myself rereading some of his passages just so I could make sure I was getting the full meaning. It is that rich and textured. It's also extremely funny in places. In the introduction it is written that Bierce lived in England for several years and was embraced by the English, who are masters not only of the language, but also insults. I'm not surprised when I look at how he writes. He can pen an insult that would bring tears of joy to an Englishman's eyes.Finally, Bierce's stories show incredible depth for the short story format. He ridicules false courage, irony, lawyers, and even unions in the story, &quot;The Revolt of the Gods&quot;. I highly recommend that anyone not familiar with Ambrose Bierce give this book a read. It reads fast and you'll laugh and be shocked within the space of one page. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Tales of Soldiers and Civilians","review":"Ambrose Bierce's collected stories, mostly of the Civil War but also of peacetime America in the last half of the 19th Century, are amazing not least because of the fact that he was one of the first to write in this genre. No doubt much of his inspiration for his Civil War stories were based upon his own observations as an officer in the Union Army while other stories may have been ones he came up with while living on the Pacific coast.Ghostly occurances, strange machines, unexplained episodes, monsters... Bierce seems to have lived in a strange world of shadows all his own. It is somehow fitting that Bierce simply disappeared in the early 20th Century.Great book. Definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Ski Tours in the Sierra Nevada Carson Pass, Bear Valley and Pinecrest, Vol. 2","review":"This book has 59 tours in the &quot;central&quot; Sierra Nevada of California.

I was looking for a version of the ESV that was extremely compact, which I could drop in my pocket and not even feel it was there. My Gideon's New Testament (New King James Version) had previously fit this description well, except for my reading I prefer the ESV for many reasons which are beyond the scope of this review.Crossway has released a compact thinline bonded leather, which I was about to order, but when a girl in my small group showed me hers I decided that it was a great little package but still a little too thick and too bulky (containing the whole old testament...which makes me still want to buy it and maybe put up with the inconvenience for the privilege of having the entire scriptures available to me in my pocket). Then I got an email a couple of weeks later from discerning reader, saying that the trade paperbook ESV was for sale for two bucks. I jumped on it and bought two, one for me and one for my wife.It has now become my daily companion to classes, to work, and pretty much anywhere else I go. My only complaint is that it does not include Psalms like so many other New Testaments do. I appreciate that in such a small package Crossway did not skimp and provided red letters for the words of Jesus.As a final note, apparently Crossway is getting better with their binding. After two months of extreme use, the binding is holding up fine with no apparent signs of wear.My advice, for such a little cost, go ahead and buy this one. Maybe add it to your wishlist or your cart for that day when your order only hits twenty-two bucks and you need that extra little bit to get you to free shipping. :-)In Christ,-Jacob Hantla"},{"Title":"The New Testament: English Standard Version","review":"I love the ESV translation and rate it five stars. I am upset that the publisher of this translation so poorly packages its product. This edition is a \\"shirt pocket\\" edition that seems well bound but has impossibly small print.What is needed is a \\"coat pocket\\" size edition of the New Testament that is bound in such a way that it will lie open of its own accord. The print size should be 10 or higher. This present edition will not lie open, and, what the more, the print is so small that only an ant could read it.Crossway publishes only two editions of the New Testament alone, and both are inferior.

This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose."},{"Title":"Trust No One","review":"From the first page to the last, this enjoyable book will keep its reader interested.

The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. &quot;Midworld&quot; was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"My eight year old son came home with this and after reading a little I took it away from him. This is the kind of stuff that warps minds and is only appropriate for those already warped. There are plenty of those.Make sure your kids don't read this untill they are older. Its all about killing and screaming in a tour of hell."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"No one intended to settle the nameless planet covered by seven levels of steaming tropical forest. A colony ship wound up orbiting it by mistake, giving the stranded passengers no other option except to land and try their best to survive. A few of them did that for long enough to have children. Now, generations later, their adapted descendants include a hunter named Born. He's a curious young man, so much so that his people call him mad. For what good is curiosity, in a place where seeking to see the sky involves going to a place called Upper Hell?When two giants drop out of the sky, only Born cares enough about the mystery to climb down through the trees and rescue them from their crashed flitter. Although they know less than the smallest child about surviving in this perilous place, Born manages to keep them alive long enough to reach the relative safety of his Home Tree. His tribe thinks it's seen him for the last time when he sets out to guide the strangers to the \\"station\\" from which they say they came - no one ever traveled that far before. As Born learns more and more about these fellow humans whose thinking is so very unlike that of his own people, and as he discovers how they mean to use the awesome power they've brought to Midworld, the young hunter's curiosity turns to horror. These invaders have to be stopped from carrying out their plans. But how?The world-building in this book amazes me. Parable and adventure tale, it works well on both levels; and it ends with a chilling twist that turns what had looked predictable squarely onto its head. Followers of Foster's Flinx books - the more recent ones, especially - will find some delicious foreshadowing in that twist."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I actually read this book a long time ago - I think it would have been in the late 70s (Note that it is a re-issue now). My local library had a copy and I re-borrowed it a number of times because I was so enamoured with the imagery of the planet Midworld. It was probably responsible for my ongoing interest in SciFi/Fantasy literature.The book is filled with vivid images of strange, alien lifeforms that are mind-boggling real. The characters are constantly threatened by death by unusual means, making it hard to find a spot to put the book down. In ways the book is similar to the more recently written &quot;Sentenced to Prism&quot;, although set in a quite different landscape. I was also interested by the revisiting of Midworld by the author in &quot;MidFlinx&quot;, although I think I prefer the original, Flinx is just too good at surviving so I knew he would make it."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"No one describes a creature like Alan Dean Foster! Hands down, the very best. His silverslith sent shivers down my arms. I've read it many times, and I even use it to teach my students how to write a descriptive paragraph. His mind knows no bounds when inventing animals, plants, and humans. Probably my favorite fantasy book of all times (though Mid-Flinx) comes in a close second."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"This is a wonderful, imaginative work about a verdant, tropical world of some truly amazing flora/fauna as conceived out of the mind of A.Dean Foster. His descriptions are encompassing, and the world is fully realized for such a short piece. I recently saw Avatar with my husband, and was struck at home much of Avatar's story was lifted from Midworld, Ursula Le Guin's \\"The Word for World was Forest\\", and other writers exploring bio-vegetative themes during the 1950s-1970s.The only part of this story I have a problem with are that there are some seriously stereotypical characters that are annoying (i.e., the super-hot moron female, muscle-bound \\"jock\\" male, etc.) but A.Dean Foster uses these stereotypes in almost ALL of his books, it can be ignored as they are a small, small portion of this books content.All in all, I recommend reading this for the sheer genius of description and creativity."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I usually am a hard science fiction reader. But my brother recommended that I read this one. WOW! This was one of the best stories I have ever read, I thought I was actually there on Midworld. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I first found interest in ADF when my father told me he was a friend of Mr. Foster. Aparently, dad actually had the honor of building Foster's garage. It's true. This was the first of his books that I read, and I loved it. The concept of a world where the defining line between the plant and animal kingdom is faint is an excellent one. And there is also a valuable lesson to be learned from midworld. I'll leave that to the reader to find out, though. I reccomend anyone who likes Sci/fi reads it."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"Long before the concept of world building gained currency among science fiction fans, Alan Dean Foster built one of the most imaginative worlds in the genre. Midworld takes place on an unnamed planet covered with dense vegetation, rising from the surface (Lower Hell) to the sky (Upper Hell) in seven layers. Although it is filled with predatory plants and animals, humans -- the descendants of a crashed spacecraft -- have carved out a niche in the middle levels. They have adapted to the world to such an extent that they seem to communicate in an almost worshipful way with the trees and vegetation that make their survival possible. They \\"emfol\\" with plant life, an empathic form of communication that assures the plant's willingness to be used for their purposes. A science station, illegally established on the world by a corporate entity, is unaware of the world's human population until a skimmer flown by two scientists is swatted from the air by a flying nightmare. The scientists -- Logan and Cohoma -- are saved by Born, who eventually leads them on a dangerous journey back to their station. When Born learns what the science station is doing, conflict ensues.Midworld combines a nifty story of corporate greed with a lost world adventure. Most of the novel -- the best part of the novel -- pits humans against the many dangers that Foster imagines on a world that is both treacherous and (for those who understand it) welcoming. In the final quarter of the novel, the humans who have adapted to the world and the newcomers who want to exploit it are not playing well together. In that regard, Midworld develops a less-than-subtle pro-environmentalist message, one that cleverly transplants theGaiatheory to an alien world. The human inhabitants of the world take only what they need, and only after they emfol with the plant life to determine whether the plant is ready to be taken. The corporate outsiders are, of course, taking whatever they want, without regard to the world's needs, and are thus (at least in Born's opinion) set on a path that will lead to the world's destruction. The heavy-handedness of the \\"good versus evil\\" storyline is offset in the final pages, which challenge the reader to reconsider the nature of good and evil in the circumstances that Foster imagines.Foster's writing style is lively; it occasionally has a literary feel that is uncommon in genre fiction. For that reason, and for the brilliantly conceived world that Foster envisions, this largely forgotten novel comes close to meriting the status of a science fiction classic. I would give Midworld 4 1/2 stars if that option were available."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I've read nearly everything Foster has written and this book is my absolute favorite (Into the Out of is a close second) The flora and fauna of this world is what grabbed my imagination and the different levels of the rain forest is very well thought out. I'd love to see Jim Hensons production company make this into a movie"},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"Make sure you have time to finish this book in one sitting -- you won't be able to put it down. The story is different but holds to a basic logic that shows itself a little at a time as the story unfolds. The few loose ends are tied up neatly at the end -- it makes sense, but, what a concept! I loved it."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"This book, like Heinlein's Starship Troopers, is a book I keep reading again and again over the years, and for similar reasons. As previous reviewers have stated, this book is quite compact, yet rich and complete, and operates on several levels. It's the description of a fascinating world. It's an adventure story. It's a character study. It's a parable. The concept is intriguing, and the characters are multi-faceted. It's a compact classic, and until today I hadn't realized that Midworld had shown up in any other books. Those books (all of them) are going on my Amazon Wish List today.Read this book, and read Starship Troopers. Both are SO much more than bugs-in-space. They're worth far more time than they actually take to read."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I first read this book as a teenager, many, many years ago, and I still dig it out of my bookshelf every other year to re-immerse myself in Foster's wildly imaginative world. He has such a great talent for inventing intriguing flora and fauna!Only two little flaws come to mind:1. Midworld seems a little too lethal for any colony to survive long enough to discover the Home Trees and make use of them.2. In Mid-Flinx, the author describes fire-extinguishing flora. They apparently don't exist in Midworld because if they did, the corporation couldn't have built their R&D; complex."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I just got a hold of an excellent library copy of Alan Dean Foster's early Commonwealth novel \\"Midworld\\" and it's brilliant. The only other novel from the so-called un-named planet is the equally brilliant novel Mid-Flinx. I happen to love rainforests as I work in an Australian one at the moment and the globe spanning rainforest covered in incredibly gigantic trees really intrigued me. The story was also an intriguing flag bearer for all environmentalists over the world without shoving it down your throat. In fact, most of Alan Dean Foster's Commonwealth novels are absolute classics in their own right. A good example is his most unusual novel \\"Sentenced To Prism\\". Silicon based life forms create an unusual planetary surface to say the least and the protagonist inadvertently shows us how you can become too reliant on technology while missing out on important life experiences. You can safely purchase these books if you enjoy world building like this. Enjoy mates!"},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I have read this book four times, and each time I find something new that I missed. Foster does a fantastic job of immersing you in the ecology of another world, populated with wildly imaginitive creatures and processes. One of my favorite books, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on SF.Alan Dean has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.You MUST read this one.

Last night, I saw \\"Avatar\\" for the first time (yeah, I usually wait for movies to come out on DVD), and like other reviewers of this book, I was shocked at how \\"Avatar\\" was more or less the same story. My significant other wondered how song writers can be sued over a handful of notes sounding the same as some other song, and \\"Avatar\\" just slides by. (Guess a big Hollywood name and tons of money are good for something.)By all means, whether you've seen the aforementioned movie or not, read Midworld. It's a great ride that leads to a truly surprising revelation. No, there's no 3-D or knockout special effects in a book, but I'd like to think the human imagination can beat the socks off enormously-expensive atttempts to replace it. The images and ideas of Midworld have stayed with me for several decades, and as an aspiring writer, that's an accomplishment I would give my right arm to match."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I have enjoyed this book for years. Imagine my surprise when Avatar, the movie, came out and the plot was essentially the same as this book. They should have given Alan Dean Foster credit for the plot.

Foster doesn't waste words here and all the &quot;fat&quot; that's prevalent in later works is completely absent (of course its short length partly accounts for that, but no complaints here).

The characters are developed okay, but the world that is created is amazing. I also loved the language that the author used and found myself using the Kindle dictionary to look up words more than I've ever used on a book before.At first, I was a bit surprised by the abrupt ending and some of the motivations and decisions made by the main characters, but after taking some time to reflect on it, there was foreshadowing well in advance and it does all make sense.This book really made me think about our world and how we live in it. It's kind of eye opening in a way.The one negative I have is for the Kindle edition for this book. I'm assuming that the mistakes were made in the translation to the ebook and are not in the original novel. Many times, one of the main character's name is misspelled (Bora instead of Born). There are also some strange characters thrown about and sometimes (admittedly, rarely) where it seemed like there were even words missing from sentences. I hope these mistakes get cleaned up in future editions of the Kindle version. This probably won't bother other people as much as it bothered me though, and even with these annoyances, I'm very glad I read the book."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"Chlorphyllous cliffs and cellulose canyons.... life erupts, no explodes in this verdant magma...

It really seems like it could have spawned Avatar."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"I've waited a long time to write this. I can count on one hand the number of books I've read more than once. Midworld has the distinction of being the only book I've read four times in my life: once as a child, again as a teenager, then a college freshman, and finally again in mid-life. Each time I discover something new, something I missed.The world is wonderfully portrayed, a character unto itself populated with creatures and plants of wild imagination. The journey of the heroes transects it both horizontally and (uniquely) vertically. On my latest read through I find the station administrator Hansen wonderfully detailed. His weariness at having to keep the station running, dealing with natives, equipment shortages and impatient, expectant bosses off-world is depicted beautifully through action and dialog.I do hope it never finds a film adaptation - that would ruin it for me. Instead it deserves to live on in print as a wonderful tale of the inter-dependency between man, animal, plant and planet. When I found this kindle edition, I didn't hesitate to purchase, and am now glad I can have this treasure to enjoy for years to come.Incidentally, I hope the kindle editions of Foster's other earlier works come to light. I particularly enjoyed Star Trek Log Nine (long out of print) and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Midworld."},{"Title":"Midworld","review":"One of my favorite books of all time.

This is a great book to get a child into the genre as every kid that I have recommended the book to has just loved it.

I read a short story years ago, back in the late 80's I had a collection of short Catholic Fiction, I read it ad enjoyed it, but there was a particular story that has haunted me. I can only describe it that way. Yet I no longer had the book. It was lent out and not returned back in the early 90''s and yet this story would come to mind again and again over the years. I did not know the author of the story, the editor of the book, all I could remember was that the book had a black cover with yellow writing.A few weeks ago I was at a retreat at Mount Carmel Monastery in Niagara Falls, and this story came to mind again. So I decided to try and find it. I did searches on Amazon.ca and Chapters.ca and tried to find the book. I searched '\`Catholic'' and 'fiction'' also 'Catholic' and '\`Short Story'' and tried many other searches. Nothing matched what I remembered but there was a book from 1984 that they did not have a cover image for The Substance of Things Hoped For edited by John Breslin S.J. so I interlibrary loaned the book at school, and found the story I was looking for. It was called, The Warm Sand by J. F. Powers and was very much what I remembered. I also found out that it had been made into a novel that won the National Book award in 1968 so I am now reading the book Wheat That Springeth Green of which the short story is chapter 6 in the book almost exactly.

Chavez's grandfather immigrated from Mexico and fathered 14 children. Cesar's father was the last one to leave the family home and married rather late, at the age of 38.Cesar did not like school, nor did he like the English language.He fasted three times for over three weeks each. This must have been tough and may have indelibly harmed his health.So, this book of course was published before Chavez's birthday became a state holiday in California.

I will simply note that the writing style used by this author is not one I enjoy reading. He is a fan of the comma and consistently breaks up his sentences with several of them to accommodate his overuse of parenthetical elements and interrupters. To me, a comma is a speed bump in prose; it indicates a pause. There a lots of speed bumps in nearly every paragraph of this book.A couple of examples: \\"How can one respect, let alone adopt, the values of a people who do not, on any level whatever, live the way they say they do, or the way they say they should?\\" and \\"It happened, as many things do, imperceptibly, in many ways at once. I date it - the slow crumbling of my faith, the pulverization of my fortress - from the time, about a year after I had begun to preach, when I began to read again. I justified this desire by the fact that I was still in school, and I began, fatally, with Dostoyevsky.\\"For some people, this is beautiful prose. For me, I can't take it. I want to dive in and rewrite the entire thing to strip out hundreds of commas and extraneous nonrestrictive modifiers. Perhaps I was a Spartan in a former life."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"James Baldwin's novel The Fire Next Time is a narrative of Baldwin's thoughts and perceptions of society throughout his life. This book expresses the point of view of a man who grew up in poverty. Poverty for Baldwin was the streets of Harlem and all of the drug trafficking, prostitution, alcoholism, and crime that took place on a daily basis. The atmosphere in which Baldwin grew up in directly affected the man he became and his views on certain issues.Baldwin was a young man during some of the most critical times in United States history and his outlook on the Civil Rights Movement is the focus this book. Growing up in Harlem, the inequalities of the black man become painfully apparent to Baldwin. He struggles with the black leaders of the time and their preaching. However, an invitation to meet with the leader of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad, provides important insight to this group. Baldwin and Muhammad's perception of white people are clearly different but the two accept each other and continue on with their lives. Muhammad and his followers believe that the white mans reign over the earth is coming to a close and blacks will soon be superior. The relationship between these two men is complicated; Muhammad seems interested in recruiting Baldwin to his cause but Baldwin remains focused on equality.W.E.B. DuBois once said, &quot;The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line&quot; (103). This issue of power and the color line is constant throughout the novel and it becomes apparent that the struggle for power seems to be drawn with racial lines. The key black figures in the novel struggle against the white culture to gain a foothold to launch themselves out of the wings and into the spotlight of the nation. Dialogue between Baldwin and a few characters question whether power is obtained from the number of followers, &quot;it is now absolutely clear that white people are a minority in the world&quot; (70), or the amount of money available, &quot;He spoke to me...of the amount of money that is annually at the disposal of Negros-something like twenty billion dollars&quot; (79).Baldwin seems partially interested in joining the Nation of Islam but rethinks his decision and draws his own conclusion of how equality and justice will be obtained. His brilliant insight has the strength to change lives and lead to equality. This novel would be perfect for a reader who is looking to understand how people of different social and economic classes perceived the civil rights movement. As a college student interested in history, the historical changes presented in this book held my attention. This book requires the reader to think of their own society and how it evolved to its current standing. This book demands the reader to think and to understand the meaning of Baldwin's words. With thought and consideration, Baldwin's theories on equality and accepting others will become clear to the reader."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"I was born in 1968, six years after The Fire Next Time was published - I lived the period that Baldwin chronicles vicariously through my parents. There are few essayists who equal Baldwin's gift for finding the right phrase to communicate a concept, both intellectually and emotionally. Indeed it's the emotion that Baldwin so effectively weaves into his prose that gives The Fire Next Time its impact. At its core, this essay is a plea.Baldwin dissects the nature of Black-White relations in the early sixties. He rejects the both the pandering of White liberals and the separatist rhetoric of Black radicals as simplistic; the former as condescending and insincere and the latter as unrealistic and reactionary. The conclusion that he reaches is that Blacks and Whites, whether they realize it or not, are locked in a symbiotic relationship, and destruction for one will mean destruction for both. Put positively, however, the key to their salvations are linked. No one is free until all are free.Baldwin focuses on two important anecdotes. The first deals with his seduction by the church, his brief career as a child minister, and his subsequent rejection of Christianity. The second deals with an encounter with Elijah Muhammad, then leader of the Nation of Islam. Both show religion as an escape mechanism, and both are told with a convincing immediacy and a sense of candor.Baldwin's rejection of Christianity appears to be a crucial step in his awakening, and in his rejection of the beliefs that 60's White society expected Black people to hold. The church for Baldwin was an escape mechanism, but having been consoled he soon fled the church, overwhelmed by its hypocrisy and abuses, both historical and current. He concludes \\"...whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being...must first divorce himself for all of the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church.\\" In the end Baldwin refuses to accept Christianity's (and, by implication, White society's) definition of him as the descendent of Ham, cursed forever.Baldwin turns the same critical eye on the Nation of Islam. He's sympathetic to the emotions and suffering that have pushed Black people into internalizing the NOI's separatist rhetoric, but he recognizes that this will not be the salvation of the Black community. Baldwin writes \\"...the Negro has been formed by this nation, for better or for worse, and does not belong to any other - not to Africa, and certainly not to Islam. The paradox...is that the American Negro can have no future anywhere, on any continent, as long as he is unwilling to accept his past.\\"Despite his cutting commentary on 60's White society, Baldwin in his heart is an integrationist. His rejection of the Nation of Islam and their philosophy is his rejection of the idea of adopting the very tactics that Whites have used against Blacks; \\"Whoever debases other is debasing himself\\", he states emphatically. Baldwin understands imitation and aggression as a tactic, but he finds awe not in an eye-for-an-eye, but in a community who's dignity has produced children of kindergarten age capable of walking through a mob to get to their schoolhouse.Not every metaphor which Baldwin uses in this essay works, and he does at time stray in his musings, but as a snapshot of the state of America in the sixties The Fire Next Time is a powerful piece of writing. As I read this book there were passages with which I identified personally; sentiments that I myself have felt but could never have articulated so effectively. There were other passages in which I was an outsider looking in. As a Black American reading this essay some forty years after it was published, this gives me a good yardstick as to how far America has come, and in what areas we are still lacking."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"James Baldwin caused quite a stir in 1961 when he published \\"Letter from a Region in My Mind\\" in The New Yorker, followed by \\"A Letter to My Nephew\\" in The Progressive the next month. He collected these two essays in this small volume, and it's considered (along with \\"Notes of a Native Son\\") his best work. His biting, heartfelt analysis on race relations flings its barbs equally at the legacy of American white supremacy and the duplicity of liberal white guilt; although it was written more than forty years ago, it reminds us both how far we've come and how far we have yet to go.Baldwin frames his observations around two thematically related biographical episodes: his brief three-year stint as an adolescent Pentecostal preacher in Harlem in the early 1940s and his journalistic visit to the headquarter of the Nation of Islam in Chicago's South Side twenty years later. Both institutions, Baldwin finds, suffer from an ambivalent myopia: Christianity in general \\"helped to protect and sanctify the power that was so ruthlessly being used by people who were indeed seeking a city, but not one in the heavens, and one to be made, very definitely, by captive hands\\"; the Nation of Islam \\"inculcated in the demoralized Negro population a truer and more individual sense of its own worth\\" through the \\"fearful paradox\\" of creating a hopeful future with \\"an invented past.\\" Blacks, he seems to say, have traded in the belief system forced on them by their oppressors to a understandable longing for an illusory past. His conclusion is aggressive but perceptive: \\"the Negro has been formed by this nation, for better or for worse, and does not belong to any other--not to Africa, and certainly not to Islam.\\"But that's only half the story--or certainly less than half. Baldwin has far more to say about this nation's white majority; the underlying subject is the predicament of \\" 'the so-called American Negro,' who remains trapped, disinherited, and despised in a nation that has kept him bondage for nearly four hundred years and is still unable to recognized him as human being.\\" Baldwin correctly posits that, historically, the usual recourse by an oppressed group in such desperate circumstances has been violent upheaval. Throughout history--white history--it is incontrovertible that \\"violence and heroism have been made synonymous,\\" from the Norman Invasion to the American Revolution. And, indeed, in such a nation as ours, \\"there is no reason that black men should be expected to be more patient, more forbearing, more farseeing than white; indeed, quite the contrary.\\"Despite the historical legacy and Baldwin's dire warnings of the potential for bloodshed, Baldwin nevertheless remains cautiously hopeful for the future, and he predicted--correctly, notwithstanding church bombings and assassinations and riots--that integration and civil rights victories and black advancement might be achieved with relatively little violence, certainly when compared to the horrors other revolutions have engendered. For one thing, blacks had--and have--an advantage: they understand, all too well, white Americans, while the reverse is not--and has never been--true: \\"Ask any Negro what he knows about the white people with whom he works. And then ask the white people with whom he works what they know about him.\\"For another, American black history has, if anything, been testimony \\"to nothing less then the perpetual achievement of the impossible.\\" Only by acknowledging the past and confronting the future Americans can \\"achieve our country, and change the history of the world.\\""},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"Of all of the great authors of the 20th century, James Baldwin was probably closest, both in style and moral authority, to some of the prophets of the Hebrew Bible. &quot;The Fire Next Time,&quot; first published back in 1963, represents Baldwin at his most impassioned. This book consists of an open letter to Baldwin's nephew, along with an extended autobiographical essay. Throughout the book, Baldwin writes with insight and compassion about the complexities of race in the United States.Baldwin writes of his spiritual crisis as a teenager--a crisis which led to his career as a youth minister in an African-American Christian church. He writes bitterly of his ultimate disillusionment with the emptiness and hypocrisy he found in the church. Baldwin also writes of his meeting with Elijah Muhammad, the fiery leader of the Nation of Islam sect and mentor to controversial Black leader Malcolm X.Baldwin's testament is a harsh critique of 20th century Christendom. Reflecting upon the rise of the Nazis in one of the world's most &quot;Christian&quot; nations, Baldwin declares, &quot;From my own point of view, the fact of the Third Reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of Christian superiority, except in technological terms.&quot;&quot;The Fire Next time&quot; is both an illuminating historical document of a turbulent era, and a superb piece of literary craftsmanship. All those interested in the art of nonfiction prose should take time to experience Baldwin's mastery of the medium. But even more importantly, we should all take time to consider his ideas on race, on religion, on prejudice, and on hope."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"Originally published in 1963, James Baldwin's, \\"The Fire Next Time\\", is an indicator of what society was like as many viewed it, and forces questions about the degree of change that has happened since he originally wrote the work. The position or the perspective of the reader, will greatly affect how each reader reacts. One issue that I do not believe can be doubted is that this is a powerful, and passionate book, written and published at a time the Author risked all manner of hatred and violence upon him. Published when Mr. Baldwin was 39, the book is not the rose colored view of youth, nor the writing with an entire lifetime to reflect upon. It does not suffer from the first, nor does it fall short do to the latter. It is writing that will elicit powerful emotions by all those who read it.Great change for the better has taken place. Former Joint Chief Of Staff Colin Powell will soon occupy the most powerful post ever held by a person of color in this Country's History. This was probably unmanageable in 1963. However this example does not represent the state of change in our Society. As an argument for how much change has taken place for the better between the races, a person pointed out to me the march on the anniversary of the sick events in Selma Alabama, and the lack of any violence. My feeling was that if the President Of The United States had made the same march with the same people in 1965, as the President did recently, the violence would surely have been different. The participation of The President and all that surround him tend to minimize Civil Rights abuse in his presence.There is no definitive measure of how much change has taken place, who is responsible, and who if anyone is to blame. The ease with which \\"The Race Card\\" is played by individuals of any color, at any level of our Country may not measure change, but it certainly does indicate that whatever change is needed is not yet completed.A very powerful work about a conflict that still occupies too much time as an issue in our Nation. This book is one man's views, and his shared personal experiences. He writing is not the final word, but after 38 years, the fact that his work and his thoughts are still relevant, speaks for the work and the man who wrote it."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"This book by James Baldwin left me with more than just the simple enjoyment of a good read, but it also left me to think deeper about the issues and reasons behind racism and races, power and control, and the even the various proposed resolutions to end racism. In the beginning, Baldwin shares how he (and a lot of minorities) come into knowing racism as a child growing up. A lot of what he shared I can remember feeling or questioning when I was growing up. Baldwin also analyzes the solution proposed to end racism and also gives his opinion on what it would take for all races to actually achieve total equality amongst all. Even today, this book makes you look deeper into this issue and at the people involved and why we all act and react the way we do. Only after understanding can we begin to apply valid solutions.

Through Baldwin's efforts, I feel that the black community made tremendous strides in seeing who they really were. Blacks during this time were taught to be ashamed of who they were but Baldwin taught them to embrace the heritage and to love being black. Along with other civil rights leaders Baldwin preached the belief to love your enemy. Baldwin left behind a blueprint for future generations of what can happen if one race ignores another race's needs and the chaos that can emerge from the ignorance."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"Beautifully written in prose form, Baldwin writes of race relations, and the awakening of one's mind to the differences, perceived or otherwise, of race, color, and their political ramifications. Very candid, and yet ultimately subtle, too---the book, which is written in the form of a letter, makes one think about the trials that many minorities (primarily African-Americans) go/went through and how far we've come today......and, yet sadly, how much further we have to go.

After reading and subsequently re-reading this powerful book, I am convinced that racism will always be an issue for this country. As a result, this book has widely opened my eyes and patently directed my path as to what my purpose is on this earth. Further, it has sharply increased the acuity of my auditory skills in that I now carefully listen to what people are really saying or not saying to me, and thus, about me. No longer will I allow anyone to \\"assault\\" or \\"murder\\" me with their definitions and expectations of who I am!

Baldwin informs to his nephew that because of the color of his skin, white America has cast him in a role in which he has no control:\\"You were born into a society....You were not expected to aspire to excellence; you were expected to make peace with mediocrity.\\"The selection that follows, \\"Down At The Cross\\", offers a flashback to Baldwin's most impressionable adolescent years where he vividly recounts the state of affairs of black folk in Harlem:\\"For the wages of sin were visible everywhere, in every wine-stained...hallway, in every clanging ambulance bell..., in every helpless, newborn baby being brought into this danger, in every...fight on the Avenue, and in every disastrous bulletin: a cousin, mother of six, suddenly gone mad, the children parcelled out here and there; an indestructible aunt rewarded for years of hard labor by a slow agonizing death in a terrible small room...\\"This then broadens into a frank discussion concerning faith, which consumes the remainder of the book. From Baldwin's religious enlightenment and conversion, to his meeting with Elijah Muhammed, to his views on the treatment of the American Negro, you will discover what makes this book such an interesting read.The Fire Next Time is an exploration into the complexities of the 1960s through the thoughts of one of the most significant Black writers of the time."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"James A.Baldwin Doesn't Pull any Punches with this Blazing&amp;Very Much Right on Time Book.this Book Speaks Volumes about the Continued Racial Divide in this Country.He Writes With Pure Honesty&amp;RIght too the Point.He breaks things down to a Science.A Must Have&amp;Timeless Book."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"If you want to know what is wrong with this country and how we got there, this book is a must read.

There are so many psychological and existential insights that I didn't expect to find in this book, some of the things he said resonate very closely to existentialism. Reading through these insights truly resonate with my spirit. Not only was James Baldwin insightful about his personal life but his social critique was simple and penetrating in exposing the charade of the racial dichotomy of \\"White/Black\\" that is politically constructed to impose socioeconomic stratification based on arbitrary colors. Baldwin knew too well that while people may be their own free agents they are still part of the larger historical process and genealogy that deeply entrenched and influenced the way they interpret and understand the world. In a sense, there is a kind of helplessness that Baldwin saw in everyone including himself, the kind of helplessness of being susceptible to the historical forces and to our own unconscious anxiety of death.This is indubitably a very insightful and profound book..."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"My number one all time favorite book. Clarified many things about racism and religion in America, by the most eloquent voice I've ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"Perhaps the most significant indictment on racism in America written in the twentieth century, The Fire Next time ignites the mind and soul, causing the reader, whether black or white to reexamine the state of human relations in this country. With the intensity of a million flames and the insight of a prophet, Baldwin details the struggles faced by African Americans (American Negroes then) in a culture that has brutalized, vilified, and rendered us powerless. His insight into the white psyche and its dehumanizing effect on African Americans is frightening and yet as real today as it was in 1962 when this essay was published. How unnerving it was to read this book in 1999 and be faced with the realization that some 37 years later we as a nation are no closer to bridging the racial divide in this country.I particularly applaud Baldwin for his eloquent discussion of what must be done, by both black and white America to release this country from the shackles that prevent us truly becoming the greatest nation on earth (in deed, not just rhetoric). I highly recommend this book as a must read for the country. In 1962, Baldwin's level of candor may have been somewhat off-putting to white America (the government considered him a Communist), for the truth can be an awfully bitter pill to swallow. Still, it's my hope that at that some point, white America will reckon with their own physiological, spiritual and political ills. Until then, African Americans must continue to hold a mirror before the face of injustice of this nation, while struggling to claim a place in a country that seems dead set on keeping us a drift."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"Now I have been, as is my wont when I get \\"hooked\\" on some writer, on something of a James Baldwin tear of late, reading or re-reading everything I can get my hands on. At the time of this review I have already looked at \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\", \\"Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone\\", and \\"If Beale Street Could Talk.\\" Frankly those works, while well written and powerful, did not altogether remind me why I was crazy to read everything that Baldwin wrote when I was a kid. The Baldwin black liberation manifesto (and, maybe, white liberation as a by-product), \\"The Fire Next Time\\", \\"spoke\\" to me then and after forty years still \\"speaks\\" to me now in so-called \\"post-racial\\" Obama time.Back in the early 1960s I used to listen to a late night talk show on the local radio station in Boston. Many times the host would have Malcolm X on and the airwaves would light up with his take on white racism, black nationalism and the way forward for the black liberation struggle- and away from liberal integrationism. Now in those days I was nothing but a woolly-headed white, left liberal \\"wannabe\\" bourgeois politico kid who believed in black liberation but in the context of working within the prevailing American society. I was definitely, and adamantly, opposed to the notion of a separate black state on the American continent if for no other reason that it would look something like the then existing ghettos, writ large, that I was committed to getting rid of and a set up for black genocide if things got too hot. And I still am. So, on the one hand, I admired, and I really did, Malcolm X for \\"speaking truth to power\\" on the race question while on the other disagreeing with virtually every way he wanted to achieve it.Now that scenario is the predicate for James Baldwin's assuredly more literary, but seemingly more hopeful, way of getting the thread of the Malcolm X message about white racism out while posing the possibility (or, maybe, necessity) of joint struggle to get rid of it. In my recent re-reading of \\"The Fire Next Time\\" I was struck by how much of Baldwin's own hard-fought understandings on the question of race intersected with The Nation Of Islam, Malcolm at the time, and Elijah Mohammad's. Oddly, I distinctly remember debating someone, somewhere on the question of black nationalism and using Baldwin's more rational approach as a hammer against the black nationalists. I probably overdrew his more balanced view of a multiracial American then, if not now.Still, Jimmy was onto something back then. Something that airy-headed kids like me, who thought that once the struggle in the South was won then the struggle in the North could be dealt with merely by a little fine-tuning, were clueless about. Don't smirk. But do note this: while only a fool or political charlatan, would deny that there have been gains for the black population since those civil rights struggle days the pathology of racism and, more importantly, the hard statistics of racism (housing segregation, numbers in the penal system, unemployment and underemployment rates, education, and a whole range of other factors) tell a very different story about how far blacks really have come over the last half century. A story that makes \\"The Fire Next Time\\" read like it could have been written today. And to be read today. Thanks, Jimmy."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"This book would be an excellent choice for required reading for High School juniors and seniors. It deals with the real issue of race in a responsible, intelligent manner, in a way that is easily understood, yet not simplistic. We get enough cut-and-dried morality thrown at us, as well as much pathetically vague garbage about \\"tolerance\\", but not many people in primary public education deal with the main issues straight on. Baldwin views things in terms of the long-haul, but warns that things cannot remain as they are without serious repercussions. In a time when black youths have less and less to look to in the mainstream, I think it would be a great move to get this book put into the public High School curricula."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"I think Balwin is a renowned author that displayed his talent in this book."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"If this book offends you then it has done it's job amazingly written and very enjoyable, makes you think about this nations future."},{"Title":"The Fire Next Time","review":"James Baldwin is one of the great American writers of this century.

But jokes aside, this book of quotations demonstrates that even if the numbers are not equal, men too have been the target of commentary but amusing and attacking for centuries. The illustrations are simple black & white drawings of a \\"Victorian\\" style, rather satirically in itself considering the gender roles at that time. The book is organized on the premise that males are a extincted species and this is a pseudo-historical view of them by the survivors, females. The book has five chapters where the quotations are organized by subject and tone. I found it actually quite interesting but not necessarily funny, but them I'm a historian and a feminist so I was over-analyzing the content, I'm sure. I find it to be a good source for bitting commentary when I write some of my fiction."},{"Title":"Eve's Revenge: Saints, Sinners, and the Stand-up Sisters of the Ultimate Extinction of Men","review":"This book reaches a new high in male-bashing, albeit with a tongue-in-cheek bent. I laughed aloud over some of the quotes, but honestly felt that it got too mean-spirited toward the end. By that time, all the humor was gone, and what was left was simply female chauvanism. All men aren't that awful, but it is interesting to see how long woman have been complaining about them!

Many people lament the fact that Tess is somewhat of a weak woman, not a strong woman, defying Victorian convention and fighting for the rights of women. I'm not entirely sure why Tess's tragic and weak personality has people so up in arms enough to say that the book is terrible and unrealistic.Personally, I found this to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. I didn't find the text to be as easy to read as some of the other reviewers, and I was an English Lit major in college! It is difficult to get through in parts, you will yawn every so often, but fight through it-- use your brain and you won't regret it!The story is tragic and offers very little in the way of an explanation for Tess's extreme punishment. So if you are looking for a book about a woman who fights convention and social injustice, go read something else. If you want a story that illustrates the cruelty of fate, comments on the injustices of the world, or a shows how, if one doesn't fight, one can be trapped by the past... read this book.I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This was the first Thomas Hardy novel I read, and it is still one of my favorites. The hypocritical late 19th century society views, and the strains they put on the human spirit. Hardy had a keen eye for what went on around him, and he was aware of how the old ways were being replaced - Edwardian enlightment was on it's way but Tess is the symbol of land of Wessex itself, violated, forsaken, and like the wounded birds she finds, longing to be put out of her suffering, despite how she endures until her situation becomes even more unbearable. Christian versus pagan, rural versus urban, her true love's struggle from his family's religious views and the restrictions of society's rules, end up costing Hardy's herione more than himself. Young Tess Durbeyfield, daughter of a poor farmer, finds herself at the mercy of a ne'er do well scoudrel, Alec d'Urberville, thought to be a wealthy relative. The girls' parents, in their naivete and ignorance, put their eldest child on a disasterous path in an attempt to improve their situation and trade on the ancient and noble family name. Tess's situation makes her an outcast, after giving birth to the cad's baby son who dies not long after birth, but she never asks for pity, and finds work at a dairy farm, only to fall in love with a provinicial minister's son, Angel Clare, who cannot forgive her past. Tragedy ensues at nearly every turn.***some spoilers herein***I think both men were unforgivable, both were terrible to Tess in different ways. Granted, Angel was nowhere near the controlling cad that Alec was, and yes Tess loved Angel. Alec thought his wealth could buy Tess's affection and possession was love. For Angel, since Tess didn't fit his idealized version of her, and that she wasn't a virgin (never mind the fact that she was raped), he couldn't bear that and took to the hills like a coward. His hypocrisy is maddening, especially since he considered himself to be such a free thinker and more open-minded than his pious family. He did see the error of his ways, returned her and they had a few days together before she was executed, but too little, too late. Tess is the most extreme victim in the novel, with Alec next, being the cause of her hardship and downfall, and for being the villain. And yes, I did say that Alec is a victim, a murder victim, but not an innocent victim. He had no qualms about manipulating situations, taking Tess against her will and using her father's death, her family's destituion, her husband's desertion and her hardships to possess her. In a time when women had virtually no rights and the fact that he had taken her virginity and fathered a child with her gave him a totally wrong sense of ownership and his determination to get her any way that he could is what lead to his fate. Both characters are doomed, while Angel must live with the fact that his actions toward the woman that he loved led to this tragedy. Not that Alec had no part in it, if he hadn't violated Tess and impregnanted her, no doubt there would have been a different outcome to her life and to his. But of course, there would have been no story, and no commentary on the standards of the time in the novel if those events had not taken place.There can be no happy ending, as this is a Hardy tale. But it makes its mark, and was immensely popular at the time of its publishing, despite the brutal critical response it received. The aching misunderstanding of longing love, the loss of innocence and a herione victimized by the standards of her era.A timeless masterpiece of literature. Tess lives beyond the pages of the book, as though Hardy knew a girl who embodied his most famous character. Worth adding to your library."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Published in 1891, this book was Thomas Hardy's best seller, and has become a literary classic. This was why I chose to read it, and I must say that I really liked it.When the middle-class Durbeyfield family learns that they are genealogically related to the noble family of d'Urbervilles, they send their beautiful daughter Tess to meet them and possibly receive a fortune from them. Tess discovers the d'Urberville family is actually of no relation to the real d'Urbervilles, and simply bought their prestigious name while they made their fortune. Tess stays and works at the d'Urberville household, and gets to know Alec, their son, who, er, treats her quite badly. I won't give away any details, but Tess has to deal with the results of Alec's treatment, and tries her best, though unsuccessfully, to move on.Though I don't usually go for many of these sappy character dramas, I really like how Hardy brought forth this novel. One develops immediate sympathy for Tess and her plight, yet she can at times be a very strong woman. The character development here is fantastic. I also liked the way Hardy juxtaposes the issue of social class (I think there must have been a law in England that every book in the nineteenth century had to confront social class in some way). Hardy also brings in symbols regarding Christian sin as well as paganism in this novel.I can see why some people would criticize this book as being slow or dull, but those readers would also probably say the same about any piece of 19th century British literature.

Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I think part of the reason I kept so interested is because I had heard some horror stories about not being able to get through the book. So, in turn, I dilligently read and looked for the hard parts. I really didn't find anything. It kept my attention. I loved seeing the journey that Tess was on. I watched her character change drastically from beginning to end. It was fun to see that change. I will read more Thomas Hardy because of this experience."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"In today's permissive day and age, it may seem far-fetched that 'Tess' was received as a bit risque by the British readership of the time. To readers a century later, the tragic story of Tess is very moving, and the nobel heroine evokes extreme sympathy from us.The novel also artfuly portrays the dynamics of life in 19th century England. We are presented with a crude, colloquial variety of the English language then spoken, in stark contrast to the stuffy, self-satisfied brand of sophisticated English that modern authors and film-makers would have us believe is all- pevasive amongst the English, in contrast to the bland, pedestrian English spoken by their brethren overseas.Hardy artfully portrays the dynamics of rural life on an English dairy farm; life that, despite the industrial revolution, is here probably not so different as it was centuries earlier.His characters are beautifully portrayed, with signicant depth. &quot;Tess&quot;, like the &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, depicts the thoughts, hopes and dreams of those consigned to a rual existence; those who are peripherally aware that the industrial revolution and the opportunities presented thereby, are radically altering life only a hundred kilometers away.Both 'Tess' and the 'Mayor' are brilliant tragedies. The astute reader knows that tragic events will ultimately prevail, but the dynamics, twists and turns of the plot in 'Tess', make it more of a compelling page turner: an excellent piece of 19-th century British lit. (If I had been forced to read it in high school, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it immeasurably less, so I commisserate with those students who were undderwhelmed by the book- read it again ten years later!).A brilliant story of an admirable, virtuous girl, who can only withstand the castigation visited upon her for the sins of others, for so long. A classic, tragic, heroine."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"There are people who will start reading this book then about 100 pages into it realize that it's going nowhere fast.

If you find yourself a little bored in the beginning- don't give up. I almost did, but I am so glad that I forced myself to read on. By the third phase I was hooked.

Hardy's style is not to everyone's taste; some argue that it is laboured and far too flowery, and this may be true in some cases, but the moral message and the profound nature of this novel far outweigh the archaic style of writing that Hardy chooses to adopt.The novel, as the title suggests, focuses on one woman in Victorian England. Her foolish and drunken father finds that he is the descendant of the ancient and landed family of the d'Urbervilles, and Tess is sent by her parents to meet one of her descendants in order to get some help from the family's financial difficulties. Alec d'Urbervilles then seduces Tess, and she is left, with illegitimate child, to deal with the consequences.After her child dies, she finds work on a farm and falls in love with Angel Clare. She feels that she cannot marry him because of her past, and, after his insistence, gives into her heart and marries him, although consumed by guilt. Eventually she confesses her past, and Angel leaves her, travelling to Brazil without her.This is not, as one reviewer described it, \\"like a bad TV movie\\". Hardy's novel is a comment on Victorian society. Tess is the ultimate victim, as many have pointed out, but she is not the victim because she chooses to be, but because society puts her in this position. Those who criticise her for being weak and being unlike any other \\"feisty\\" women in other nineteenth century novels forget that, unlike characters such as Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennet, Tess was poor; and that, unlike Jane Eyre, Tess was raped. Tess is the perfect example of a blameless woman who cannot escape from the confines of society. Arguably the point of the novel is that Tess cannot change how people perceive her, and, because she has no means to support herself, she has to hide the truth and battle on with the terrible injustice that has been done to her. Victorian society would simply have ostracised a woman who had had an illegitimate child and not married the father, no matter the circumstances, so I find it deplorable that people feel that Tess was spineless when she was placed in such an impossible position.Also, any new reader, and, indeed, any old reader who hasn't accepted this point yet, should perhaps try to understand that Tess is suffering, throughout the novel, from terrible grief, guilt and depression, which is surely enough to earn anyone's sympathy, not their scorn. Hardy did not invent a \\"cocker spaniel\\" of a woman; she is a literary construct and is used in a wider sense to illustrate those taken advantage of in Victorian society; and the only reason she comes back \\"for more\\" punishment is because she cannot escape it, no matter how she tries.Additionally, it has been claimed that Hardy's characters are one-dimensional and contradictory. I take issue with this. Alec may be one-dimensional in some senses, but he is an unremittingly unpleasant person; it destroys the comment being making if Alec was an abused child, or in any way a redeemable person. And yes, Alec is turned into a preacher, but anyone who believes that he sincerely let go of his previous persona must not have understood his character properly. It is a perfect way of introducing him again into the story, and a perfect way to illustrate his own falseness, by comparing him with Angel's father, who is the Good Samaritan. It is the contrast between what Tess could have chosen and what she did - in fact, arguably, not meeting Angel's father is the only mistake that SHE makes (opposed to outside forces placing decisions upon her).Angel on the other hand is in no way one-dimensional. Although his opinion of Tess does change rapidly, it is not unbelievable on careful reading. He likes to think of himself as a maverick and someone outside of society's rules, but he is an excellent portrayal of how we all are constructs of our society. Angel, although he loves Tess, keeps referring to the fact that she is \\"pure\\", which she is not (through no fault of her own). This is a clear indication, early on in the novel, that Angel has painted himself a false image of his bride-to-be, and, for all his good qualities, he is as flawed as the next person. I fail to see how this is a shallow portrayal of a character.Tess is also not a nonsensical, weak being, but a beautiful, sad creation of Hardy's used to show injustices, and highlight practises that should be stopped. Besides that, in her own right, she is a clever, melancholy character who really should inspire the reader's pity.I have no objections with people who dislike this novel because they dislike the style or because they dislike some character development for sensible reason; but when people decide to abuse a novel because they don't seem to have bothered to read into it properly, I find it irritating to say the least. This novel requires people to put themselves in the place of another and feel sympathy with another person.One reviewer commented that the novel was ill-received when it came out, and should have stayed that way. The novel was considered offensive because of the implied sexual context and because of its criticisms of Victorian morals, but this does not make it a bad novel; this means that it encourages people to think, to question and to re-evaluate. Any novel that is so brave as to find an injustice in society and write a whole novel criticising it deserves our praise; and Hardy's writing, far from doing the idea down, only helps to elevate the moral: that society can be wrong."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Having just finished this book a mere few hours ago the pain of it is fresh in my mind, but I'm sure it will distract me for weeks, such is the intensity of this tragedy. The only other novel of Hardy's I have ever read - Jude the Obscure - was a good book, stable and interesting, though not compelling until it's heart-wrenching twist three quarters of the way through the book. It was, in essence, more a social commentary, so it was with some surprise that I absorbed the constant emotion and passion that was this book. The basic storyline is as follows: Tess Durbeyfield, a young woman of a poor country family, is sent to visit her rich cousin, Alec d'Urbeville, after learning of her (perhaps mythical) relation to the ancient family which bears his name. In the obscure randomness that fate casts over life, innocent Tess is then pursued by perhaps the only man she could never tolerate (Alec), who is as his most evil in the early parts of the book. At Alec's house Tess works as a keeper to the poultry and is assaulted by Alec's constant sexual attentions until finally (and this is suggested rather than explained), exhausted and numb, she submits to intercourse with him. She later gives birth to a baby, whom she names Sorrow, who soon dies; and then meets a man she had glimpsed once years before at a dance: Angel Clare. Working together at a milking farm, they become drawn to each other despite Tess's unwillingness to incite the attentions of any man. Their love for each other grows but Tess knows that she dare not enter into marriage considering her past and a society that is both ludcrously religious and prejudiced. The strength of her love finally wears her down and they wed. However, on that very night she confesses her past, and is cruelly thrown aside by Clare, who now begins to view her as an impure woman separate to the Tess he had always loved (despite his past containing a similar history). After suffering years of solitutde and hardship, Tess finally gives up on Clare and falls in the way of Alec d'Urbeville again, relying upon him for the care of herself and her family. Sick and wasted, Clare eventually realizes the mistake he has made in casting Tess aside and finds her at d'Urbeville's mansion: too late. This brings the story to its close where greater tragedy ensues.The book was brilliant in its emotive persuasion and its depiction of Tess, who is impossible to not feel for, and, indeed, love. The misfortunes of her life are never self-inflicted, and we are left to wonder at the end at the awful nature of a world that would bring such sorrow upon one person. Tess is wonderful, stoic, and pure in her unyielding love for Clare; d'Urbeville is horrible in his initial portrayal as the villain who will singlehandedly destroy Tess's life, though is perhaps a little less repulsive at the end as one understand's the depths of his feeling for her; and Clare is the one who holds in his hands the ability to restore all past wrongness and find joy himself, but tragically fails to do so because of pride and convention.Overall, there were only two problems I had with the storyline: the first being Tess's succumbing to Alec's sexual persuasion in the beginning - if we are to believe that she is repulsed so many times by Alec's advances so completely and bodily, how are we to believe that she so easily concedes in one (unmentioned) incident? Her strength is greater than that. And the second is one which has been mentioned by another reviewer here: the ending, where a minor, unimportant character is introduced as a means through which to resolve everything, where in fact she is incapable of doing so, since we know nothing about this character, and can therefore put no faith in her.Despite these minor quibbles the whole of the book, with its engaging plot and brilliant prose, is worth more than the sum of its parts, with the pain of lost love being the principle effect one experiences long after the reading is over. Tess is beautiful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction. Despite Tess' best efforts (like Jude in the other Hardy novel), she is unable to escape the poverty and misfourtune which she attempts to leave behind. Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is an intensely depressing but brilliant depiction of the connections between love, fear, and guilt.

Her parents (and especially her father) are greatly heartened by the news that they are, however distantly, nobility. Tess is therefore sent to her richer relations, the d'Urbervilles of Trantridge, to claim kinship and benefit from their superior finances.Upon taking her position as a bird-tender, Alec D'Urberville is captivated by Tess's natural country beauty and seduces her. Tess is an innocent, and she returns home to bear her child. After bringing shame upon her family, Tess must attempt to build a respectable life out of a situation that denies her every particle of respectability she once had.Hardy writes in a rather long-winded, flowery style. His vocabulary is rich, but it can become tediously melodramatic at times. The plot of this novel is full of coincidences that seem rather implausible, but it is a wonderful portrayal of the prejudices of society. Tess is an absolutely heartbreaking character, enduring trial after trial silently, feeling it is her due.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is a solid read, but be prepared to be thoroughly depressed and disillusioned with society at its finish."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"One of my friends recommended that I read Thomas Hardy, but she cautioned me: &quot;Thomas Hardy isn't for everyone.&quot; I discovered while reading &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; that what she may have meant is that Thomas Hardy didn't write light works to be read and then forgotten about. Through this book, Hardy addresses issues that society in his day didn't want to face: the fate of the farm worker in the increasingly industrialized society, predjudices held against minority groups, and the inequality of women. All of this is not to say that this is a dry or boring work -- &quot;Tess&quot; is gripping, riveting, and almost overpowering in its emotional appeal. One cannot read this book without becoming involved in Tess's situation. I have never been so angry with a character in a book as I was with Angel Clare at a certain point in the novel. So, in conclusion, &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; isn't for everyone. . . but it should be for every thinking person, everyone who isn't afraid to face issues, think deeply about them, and apply them to life."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Some great discussions come out of this book. Thomas Hardy has a very distinct style, and uses the environment essentially as another character, so it may be beneficial to at least have some familiarity with England before reading. No one can read this book without having strong opinions about the characters, especially the two main men. This is one of the standout pieces of literature of its time and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" describes the experiences of a woman who, through no fault of her own, falls outside of the moral code of the Victorian era in which she lives and suffers long-reaching consequences as a social outcast. Hardy's novel is carefully well-drawn, but the novel's content demands far more than Hardy could acceptably give it in the nineteenth century. For example, the rape scene is only is carefully stepped around, inferrable only from the fact that Tess subsequently has a child; Hardy also has to carefully frame some of the scenes, such as that of Alec d'Urberville's murder, in order to avoid too closely examining the psyche of the criminal. Hardy's writing is at its best in the scenes surrounding Angel and Tess's estrangement - a safe enough environment - when he can freely move within the minds of his characters. In short, \\"Tess\\" is the stuff of a twentieth-century novel written in the nineteenth, which leaves some of the emotion that modern readers are accustomed to lacking."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Even reviewing Tess makes me choke back tears. Hardy develops one of the most truely beautiful female characters in all of English literature; then, like an evil wizzard, slowly tears her to shreds and finally grounds her into dust.A modern young woman growing up now might find it hard to identify with Tess. She is a poor farm worker and a product of the cultural changes at the beginning of the industrial revolution in England. But there is enough of a study of basic human nature here to make her story valuable to just about any reader.Hardy's prose is gifted, deep descriptive narative and character development. You may end up loving Tess; it's hard not to hate Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I can't believe how tragic this book is!

A month later, it was drivng me crazy not knowing how the characters fared, and I took it out and finished it. But this time, I knew how to read it: I didn't try so hard to relate to the characters, I just read their story.

Ok, that's all."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I first read Tess in preparation for my IB high school exam (9 years ago). Thus, like many other of the reviewers on this page, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read. I must admit that at first the reading was quite tedious. It must have taken me two months to read through the novel. If I had written a review after this first encounter with Tess I might well have given the novel a two star (**) rating. I believe one of the explanations for this lack of enthusiasm is that I did not get along well with my English teacher and I felt that I could not allow myself to enjoy Tess, lest I let my teacher score an important victory.As the exam period itself approached I read Tess four more times with increasing enjoyment. The last few readings were truly enlightening. I knew exactly what I would encounter on the next page and yet I shuddered with anticipation, reacting to the words even before my eyes caught them.It seems clear to me now that the reason I enjoyed Tess so much was not only the familiarity bred by multiple readings but also the dissection of the novel in the classroom. I must confess that although we had problems getting along, my English teacher was excellent.The only advice I can give those of you who doubt Tess' greatness is to muster some courage and give the novel another chance. Tess is on my all time Top 10 list along with The Grapes of Wrath, which, incidentally, I was &quot;forced &quot; to read in my high school English class."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A must read. Thomas Hardy's diction is unforgettable. Just like a Shakespeare play, every sentence must be savored. Despite the seemingly overwhelming amount of detail included, the novel is extremely readable. All this detail allows the reader to have vivid pictures of each and every scene painted in their minds. From the action filled beginning to the somewhat predictable but nevertheless fantastic ending, the reader will be on the edge of his or her seat, wondering what misadventure Tess will fall into next. The protagonist, Tess, can easily be classified as a heroine of the Victorian era. Her character is impossible not to love, tragically selfless, humble, and beautiful inside and out. The events of the novel make one feel an anger towards not only some of the characters, but towards what they represent and the society which they live in. From the misogynistic, deceitful character of Alec to the well-intentioned but foolish character of Tess's mother, even to our main character, the wide eyed, innocent, ever altruistic character of Tess, every character has a statement to make about the world that Hardy places them in. And with Tess's fatal flaw, one can't help but think of how applicable it is even in today's time. Making bold statements on gender lines, social status lines, and the inevitability of fate, this novel transcends time. A quick recommendation-though at times the book may seem to drag out, it is certainly worth it to continue reading and finish the novel. Also, as the novel progresses, the wording certainly gets easier to understand."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The stories and the characters may seem simple and dramatic, however, of the classic nature of Greek mythology, consistent with other books by the author, such as The Return of the Native, and the Mayor of Casterbridge. The essence of the book seems to me, is about the tragedies humans suffer, caught in the conflicts between nature and culture. The nature is harsh but straightforward as love is, but the culture presents hypocrisies and judgment, separating people between splendid star and blighted one. Whether to worship the sun, or to worship the standards of Judeo Christianity? There are different judgments in wealth vs. poverty, religion vs. spirituality, men's honor vs. women's purity. And there is plenty of ambiguity in all of them but ultimately, the \\"anachronism of love and chance\\" leads the characters to classic tragedies in the end. Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The title character Tess journeys across the rural English countryside amidst a stark voyage of discovering exactly who she is. Her story is one filled with various sorrows, cathartic or otherwise, punctuated by only fleeting amounts of peace and happiness tossed somewhere in-between. It's not an easy read--nor is it meant to be--for a few reasons. Hardy thrives on description, some of which might seem unnecessary to the modern-day reader (particularly the extended glimpses of the dairy farms), though we do need to understand the Victorian world we're in. Consequently, the author wants to garner as much support as he can for his protagonist, who loses her innocence quickly and spends most of the book scraping up the pieces of a wreckage that was never her fault in the first place. And these glimpses into her troubled consciousness ache and resonate with us a century on. So if we understand the atmosphere she has to contend with, we begin to understand Tess--and sympathize with her plight and misfortune along the way.When the meat is torn off the skeleton, it's a solid (albeit lengthy) read about the meshing and clashing of various characters in nineteenth-century England. The choices of some of the characters throughout, some of which might be construed as twists, are not entirely believable though add definite color to the work, especially the last two \\"phases.\\" These culminate in a conclusive ending that is both haunting and beautiful. This won't be for everyone, though if you can withstand some archaic language here and there, you might enjoy this tragic tale about love, loss, and a stringent society that tried so desperately to dictate both."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is a great book. The desriptions are beautiful. I was shocked to see how many people trashed it.Look, Thomas Hardy was portraying the tragic struggle of a simple country girl living in the 19th century. Women weren't treated well, let alone poor women. In my opinion, he spoke of Tess with tenderness and compassion. He was not trying to say she deserved all that anguish, but the reality is that that's the way it was. If anything I think he was trying to advocate respectful treatment of women."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I first read this book as a teenager.

I understand why and how she came to do what she did."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This review is for Amazon.com - don't read if you don't want a spoiler for the ending. I loved this book - it had great character development, a truly elegant writing style, and a plotline that kept me enraptured right up to the end. Hardy's forte was capturing the irresistability of temptation even with the most staunch of intentions. However, I'm quite irritated at the amazon.com editorial review that gives away the entire ending. What's up with that? Thinking that Amazon of all places wouldn't be so daft as to give away the ending in the review, I was expecting the ending in the middle of the book and was sorely disappointed to learn that WAS the ending and that I had known it all along. Please update the editorial review and remove the details of the story ending.As for the ending itself, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending wasn't quite as expected. While the plot of the ending wasn't unexpected (especially having read the editorial review), the turn of events and seemly strong character traits of Angel and Tess appear to have evaporated in an instant. While Angel had to spend a year away from Tess to work up to his acceptance of her prior transgression, he doesn't seem to think more than a blink of her having killed a man. And Tess holds such a strong belief in her own low self worth, that she is unwilling to marry the man she loves for disgracing him. And then, kills a man without as much thought as deciding to boil a cup of tea. So, even though the writing style and the majority of the book were fantastic, the ending is the spoiler and the reason for only 4 stars. This book is still very much worth a read simply for the enjoyment of the journey."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Just a fantastic novel. The larger issues it addresses, as is the case with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, are the very largest that we face. But the detail is also there, all the way down to every scent, sound, and emotion of the daily commute of a young milkmaid in Victorian England. That such strikingly detailed imagery sits easily atop the largest issues of our existence is a marvel. An amazing, important novel. One of the best."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels. Hardy expects you to be intelligent enough to understand the classical references in his novel without having to explain them to you. Even if you miss all of those however, it's still an excellent read. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading.Eric Gundberg"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Exquisite writing, fascinating story, a rural English world so real it's as if you're walking through it, smelling every meadow and farmyard, hearing every hoof beat and raindrop, feeling the sun and the mist, seeing every color change as the light shifts. Readers who like Tom Clancy will probably find Hardy too slow. Readers who like James Joyce will probably find Hardy too old-fashioned. The more time I spend in Hardy's world, the happier I am, even when the outcome is unhappy, as it is with Tess. It's hard to pick a favorite of his books; they're all so wonderful, but if I had to choose only one to take to a desert island, this would probably be it (though a tough choice between this and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\"). My husband and I dream of going to Dorset because of Hardy. I hope one day we make it. You simply can't do better than Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Also highly recommended is Roman Polanksi's film \\"Tess,\\" probably the most faithful and beautiful film adaption of a classic novel ever."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Timeless story of a woman and her struggle to care for those she loved. Fighting against the male dominated society of her time, Tess sacrifices her own interests to provide for her family and attempt to stay true to the man she loves. Hardy does a wonderful job of painting the landscape and using it to enhance Tess's physical struggles. His portrait of Tess as a strong woman is balanced with her vulnerability, pure heart and hope for a better future.Norton's version includes insight into Hardy's background and the writing of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Very helpful towards understanding the dynamics of the story."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book is a n excellent read.

Nothing could top Pride & Prejudice, but this is a real literary masterpiece. The way Hardy creates depth of character leaves you feeling utterly heartbroken...like it was happening to one of your own loved ones...or even yourself. Even Alec, as the antagonist, becomes something more than just someone you automatically hate.I would recommend this book to everyone that enjoys well written literature with captivating stories. However, I would say that is isn't at all for the faint of heart. I was nearly inconsolable for an entire night after I finished this novel, and I still find myself thinking about it a week later.

I like to read books other authors have read or recommended or quoted. I like reading period pieces and about the lifestyles of how people lived and viewed the world at different times in our history, and this book falls into that category. It's a love triangle with serious characters and story line. Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking people were not sophisticated 2 hundred years ago, but they were and had difficult issues in which to deal within their cultures. As the author was an Englishman, there were loads of vocabulary learned with reading this book, but it was fun because it's so easy with the Kindle to look up a word. It's a story of innocence lost, love found, lost, found again, and ultimately lost again (and ever so tragically).

Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on &quot;Tess..&quot;"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The whole tragedy is in the fact that I was NOT forced to read this book but actually picked it up because I WANTED to read it (or so I thought at the time). I have read many books in my life, quite a lot of them classics, but I have to say that this book just about drove me bananas. I think there is a general misapprehension in thinking that a classic must be good.I dare not even think of how many times I probably came close to being committed to an asylum for acting suspiciously on the train while reading \\"Tess\\" (every two seconds I would sigh, roll my eyes, scoff or just plain throw my hands in the air from frustration). Many reviewers had rightly pointed out that the character of Tess is the shubbiest excuse of a woman in the whole Solar System. How can anybody, in any age, on any continent, be as spineless and masochistic as she is? This woman is more of a martyr that Joan of Arc, for crying out loud.The excuse that this book takes place in Victorian England doesn't quite cut it. I saw more strength and backbone in Hester of The Scarlet Letter (which story took place in a much more prudish and puritanical setting than England of 1800's).I think Thomas Hardy invented himself a woman who would act like his cocker spaniel; no matter how much he beat the crap out of that 'faithfull friend' the poor dog would always come crawling back and lick his boots, which is pretty much how Tess acts throughout the book. The whole scenario smacks a lot of a perverted male fantasy. Maybe Hardy had a nasty mother, who knows. I bet psychiatrists would have a field day with the author.I am disappointed and feel cheated of the time that I could have used to read something else; Dickens, for example. Or just Maeve Binchy, if I wanted female driven narrative. \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" would have been a much better book if that idiot-of-a-husband and Tess herself would fall into that bloody river in the middle of the book (exactly as Tess wanted it) and have done with it. I know I would applaud such a great ending!In short: steer way clear of this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"fascinating story of an ancient civilization"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Having a degree in English Lit., it seems sinful for me to accuse Thomas Hardy of being a terrible writer, but there it is. Any writer today submitting a manuscript like this would have it rejected out of hand. This is not a book for an audience seeking a good, fast-paced story that speaks for itself. If you read this book, you will have to interpret every word, description, and action, try to guess what universal message the author is attempting to convey and what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given time. In short, the kind of book that college English professors love, and try to emulate, and remain college English professors because they will never get such a thing published.First of all, character development is not only lacking, it is absent altogether. It might be assumed that the book's title character, at least, would be strongly drawn, someone we could sympathize with, empathize with, or relate to in some way. Not the case. While Hardy expounds upon Tess' physical appearance ad nauseum throughout, never did I gain any real insight into her thoughts and feelings, her motivation. Maybe the insight is hidden in these endless physical descriptions or her inane actions, but frankly, if I'm reading for pleasure I don't want to take the time to search. Sorry. And it follows that if Hardy failed in his title character, forget about all the others.Secondly, his wordiness is irritating. One paragraph of half-way interesting action is followed by a full page of useless description and genuflecting. Perhaps essential to hidden meanings and motives and social commentary, but again, I'm not taking the time to search. I found myself skipping over these, the result being my finishing the book in two evenings.Conversely, Hardy seems to gloss over the most important event in the book, cloaking it in overly subtle tones. Granted, this was written during the sexually-repressed Victorian Era, for an audience with \\"delicate sensibilites\\", but come on. Something as traumatic and life-shattering as rape, in fact the event that is supposed to drive the entire novel, deserves more than an allusion to medieval knights taking advantage of peasant girls. Not that I want graphic details, on the contrary. But please, give me a break; even if her society deems she take it as a matter of course, let us see, clearly, her inward rage, hurt, bafflement at what has happened to her. Something. Anything. Make her human, in other words.If you really must read this, a synopsis would be enough. The novel's idea is a good one, and could have probably been done brilliantly by someone else. Hardy fails it miserably."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A great windbag of a novel, Hardy seems to think that not only does a grassy meadow take half a chapter to describe, he thinks that everyone else agrees with him. Please. Not the largest complaint I have, but surely the first, is that Hardy's style is like looking up looking up &quot;stone pillar&quot; in a thesaurus, then two others, and then writing down every single synonym. It takes pages for him to describe a dairy farm, and at some point you wonder if he's introducing the farm as a character, it gets so much time.Not that he seems to spend that much time on his characters; they are created with little that interests, and contain less development that a homeless shelter under President Bush.Tess is described, at great length, and quite often, as a beautiful woman. Okay, so what? Her personality is so weak I wonder if he even thought about what she would do in a situation, or just had her do whatever the other characters wanted her to do, until the very end, when she makes an out of character action that is supposed to be shocking, but is more perplexing; the character described in the rest of the book wouldn't do that, and there is nothing to indicate why she has a sudden change of being.Angel is built up as the &quot;perfect prince in shining armor&quot; until he finds out about Tess's secret, when he suddenly acts like a selfish and snotty child that is the very opposite of what he has been in the rest of the book. Then he switches back at the end, with little thought as to why by Hardy, at least not much that is apparent in the book.Let's see, boring writing style and poorly done characters, what else is there? Ah, plot. The only way to describe plot is that it made the description seem riveting and his characters thought out. He's spend the time to talk about Tess getting a job, then the next chapter she is suddenly running away from it; I felt robbed of the time spent in the build up, and knowing more in detail of what happened in the intervening time from when she got the job to when she quit would have helped with her character. And when you think there is no need for detail, Hardy's got more than enough. He spends ages talking about Tess and Angel's time together at the dairy farm, but none of their actions change the way they feel about each other. He could have cut our some of their horse riding, and no one would complain.In short, Hardy's the kind of writer who is analogous to a storyteller that likes the sound of his voice; just because he can say something, he does. And in his endless drivel, what might be interesting is skipper over. This guy could have used and editor.When it first came out, this book was ill received, and I see no reason for anything to have changed since."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

Beyond the story is Hardy's description of the English countryside, which, in themselves, are masterpieces. Granted, it is not an idealistic in tone, but still, it is an astounding novel.

Her quest to ask the aide of recently discovered, distant kin leads Tess unwillingly into the arms of Alec her &quot;cousin&quot; and from this action her life falls into a spiral of difficulties. Her misdeeds and those of others lead again and again to trials in her life. Hardy creates wonderful full-bodied characters and sets into motion one of the greatest stories of a woman of all time.

I was in awe of Hardy's ability to flesh out this woman, Tess Durbyfield, and just give her total realism. The other main character, Angel Clare, is also brilliantly flawed, and shows you that in real life there is no such thing as a prince charming. If you can sit and work through the sometimes tedious 19th century style of Hardy, you will come away from this book moved.

However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign.

It is a pastoral - the set-piece descriptions of nature (the play of light at differing times of the day, the verdant plenitude during Tess and Angel's courtship, the astonishing effect of bonfires at dusk etc.) are among the most overpoweringly vivid in literature, genuine word-painting - and an anti-pastoral, with even the natural world infected with poisonous, unnatural social conventions, with the growth of Talbothays petrified into the sterile limbo of Flintcomb-Ash.As in Shakespeare, there is a conflict in 'Tess' between the surface, linear plot, which tells a transient, austere tale of some people whose existence is short and ultimately barren, and the movement of the imagery, eternal, self-generating. The abundance of the latter makes the relentless grimness of the former just about tolerable (although the Flintcomb-Ash section is painfully unreadable) - as in Shakespeare, the burden of sexuality and emotion denied by society is placed on the natural world, on the language and the imagery, so the emotional deprivation in the plot starkly contrasts with its potent, lubricious surroundings.The plot is not 'realistic', but ritualised and patterned, set in heavily symbolic, paganistic sites, human nature stylised in pageants and tableaux. The climactic part, where Hardy twice startlingly changes narrative point-of-view, ushers in a new age of anti-Victorian fiction."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I was forced to read Tess for summer reading. I have possibly never been so glad to finish a book, not out of joy at a good reading experience but because the novel was such torture to wade through, in all its melodrama, sensationalistic elements, unlikable characters, and gaping holes in the plot, especially towards the end. Tess is a weakling who acts illogically, vacillates and secures the reader's complete disgust before the end. One should already know it from the title and the first few pages, where Tess's father, a peasant, finds out that he is the relic of an old noble family (his real name is Durbeyfield). Why cannot books have sense? All through the novel I longed to be reading Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch. The time this book was written in has nothing to do with it; both the two books just mentioned were written considerably before it. I was left with a very poor impression of Thomas Hardy's talents as a writer. (Incidentally, it should tell you something that more than one reader/reviewer compared it to the movie Titanic.)"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A true joy to read, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is filled with situations that paint pictures of real life. Hardy knew that Tess' reality was filled with enough emotion and drama that there was no reason to add to it the things fairy tales are made of.When reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles you are brought into the story by Hardy's suberb way of sketching the scene. Though Hardy's descriptive writing can sometimes be hard to digest, his choice of words allow you to enter the landscape and smell the glen yourself.Overall, an excellent book for the more ambitious reader, and for the one who isn't afraid of the less popular unhappy outcomes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy is one of the best books I have read in the past five years. It combines love and tragedy wonderfully. The characters leave memories enbeaded inside your mine. Especailly, Tess and Angel. Their love for each other is magical. It truly is a wonderful love story. By saying this you have to have a thought-provoking mind to understand the different subject matter. That is why most people read the book because you have to think and it is a sad story. I personally had to read it for class, and what honestly surprised me is the cleverness Hardy portrays to make his heroine more real rather than just another character. The way that it starts off how Tess and Angel don't seem like they are going to get together and how they eventually do. When they finally get together Tess has a confession to make to Angel. In the book we find out that Tess may have been raped or seduced by Alec. We are not sure but Angel leaves Tess because either way she isn't pure anymore. This is so hypocritical of Angel because Tess forgave him for having an affair with an older woman in London but he doesn't forgive Tess. So basically he's a jerk to be blunt with it. Eventually Angel forgives his wife, Tess and they leave Brazil. Tess goes back to Alec and murders him, so she can be with Angel without any worries. Due to this they hid away but get caught and the tragic ending comes. Tess is exacuted for what she has done.I like how the plot is not really &quot;realistic&quot; but follows a designed pattern, using heavy symbolic means. Hardy writes the book to leave an effect of you. You feel Tess's agony and confusion. You want to help her and wish you could show her the right path to take. I found myself talking to her when I read the book so she can do the right thing. That shows how Hardy gets you really involved. Difficult or not, if you like to read, I strongly recommend reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles. It is deservinly allowed to be called a classic. Hats off to Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a master craftsman.

Such is the power of Hardy's prose.\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\", was published in 1891. It was one of the last -- and arguably the best -- novels from Hardy's pen. It's the story of Tess, a country girl in a fictitious English county,Wessex, and her tragic struggle against destiny. As somebody has already mentioned, Hardy has chosen the backdrops of the story with the same care with which he describes people: valleys and moors are also portrayed as if they too are characters of the novel. The Vale of Blackmoor, Tess's birthplace, is described as \\"an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape painter\\", and \\"in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry\\". The Flintocomb-Ash, the place where Tess was subjected to some very rough manual work, is painted as \\"a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin\\". And the place where Tess fell in love, the Vale of Froom, is \\"that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts.\\"There are several tearjerkers in the novel but I found one moment particularly touching where Tess decides to baptize her illegitimate baby herself. And when the baby -- named Sorrow -- dies, Hardy becomes a little bitter: \\"Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of little brilliancy - luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginning\\".To put forth the case of an unwed mother so passionately in &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; was something of a stir in the English society of late nineteenth century, which was so obsessed with feminine virginity. The novel received some severe criticism initially, which ultimately forced Hardy to stop writing novels and concentrate on poetry."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book was a good book at times and a somewhat boring book at times. I was assigned this book to read for english class. In my class there were those who liked it and those who didn't. I on the other hand thought it to be just Ok. Tess had her moments when you wanted to cheer her on but most of the time was spent looking back to try and understnad what happened, and many times the book was such that it put you to sleep ( which happened to me on 7 occasions ). In all it is not a bad book, but I would not recommend it to younger readers, and if any english teachers are reading this please think about what your students would like to read not yourself and what you think is good."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat!

Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"What is the point of reading classic literature if all you are going to do is analyse it? What a waste. Hardy, Austen et al would be turning in their graves if they knew that their work would be treated in this way by self-proclaimed experts. Classic novels are to be enjoyed; they are written for the satisfaction of all readers, not just to massage the egos of academics.Yes, I've studied classic literature, and it isn't the genre I am typically interested in. However, \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\" is the novel that has inspired me to give this genre another try. I found it to be incredibly moving; dismissing the idea that it was poorly written. I've found English literature too stifled by its own airs and graces, but this is not the case with Thomas Hardy. He paints a picture of great hope in a way that allows us to empathise (unlike some of his contemporaries) with the characters of a different era.I recommend anyone who wants to start reading classic English literature to begin with \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\". You will find it an easily accessible read. It is beautiful, hopeful and tragic."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"It seemed to me that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a bit dull at times, but the storyline as a whole was quite interesting. There is a great deal of imagery, so much that I deemed it to be in the way of my actually getting absorbed in the novel. Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring. I recommend this if you have plenty of time to devote to a novel (not looking for a quick read), and if you like Hardy's style; if you do, you'll find this to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A love story that has all of the makings of a made for TV movie.

A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a novel remarkable only in its quality to inspire hatred from those unfortunates forced to read it. Melodramatic and unrealistic, it meanders interminably exploring the theme of a &quot;pure woman&quot; before finally finishing with an ending that has little impact on the disgusted reader.Tess is, in short, a useless book. Apart from keeping a healthy fire roaring in my hearth, Tess contains little of merit. Well, I suppose one could improve one's vocabulary by reading Tess (fun, but completely useless words like &quot;prestidigitation&quot; abound), but reading &quot;How to improve your verbal scores on the SAT&quot; is inarguably more concise and probably more entertaining.Not to say that there is nothing to be learned from the characters. Simply observe their actions in certain situations and do the opposite. The three main characters, particularly Tess, are just begging to have a little common sense smacked into them. However, Tess can be considered enigmatic in one respect. Hardy seems to be unable to decide whether she is just ordinarily pretty, or 'a dazzling fair milkmaid' so it is up to the reader, should he still be awake, to decide. At any rate, her big, multi-colored eyes and Pre-Raphaelite hair and figure hide a complete vapidity painfully evident to the modern reader. She only develops a spine near the end of the novel, when such a change is unconvincing and thoroughly out of character.So...a predictable and heavily padded plot, infuriating characters, too much symbolism, inappropriate philosophical discussions and a great dollop of Victorian fluff. The result? Tess of the d'Urbervilles roasting on an open fire."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"HARDY HAS A MAGICAL WAY OF CREATING A CHARACTER THAT EVENTUALLY BECOMES REAL TO US.

I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end.

Through his exquisite use of imagery, his reflection of Tess in nature, and the continuing thread of tragedy which he weaves throughout the novel, Hardy is able to present to us one of the most memorable figures in English literature. Despite her sincerity and integrity, Tess is forever destined for disappointment, and Hardy's immensely lucid and descriptive writing allows the reader to appreciate this. I would recommend this tremendous piece of fiction to any readers interested in reading the work of a brilliant Victorian author, or for those who appreciate the paradox of sadness and beauty represented in the figure of a strong protagonist."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy employs nature as a tool in helping him depict and develop the tragic nature of his protagonist, Tess. At least two aspects of nature are central to achieving this end: First of all is the establishment of a correlation between Tess's mental state and natural settings. Second, the use of natural phenomena as a prediction of Tess's own fate. Hardy has fully exploited the use of nature to illustrate that Tess is the victim of her uncontrollable and predetermined Fate.Hardy establishes from the beginning the notion that the world is a mere &quot;psychological phenomenon&quot; (Hardy 101). One can, therefore, deduce from this &quot;fact&quot; that nature, as it is seen through Tess's eyes, is only the physical image of Tess's inner emotions during a particular period of time. It is during the intercepting period between her devastating seduction by Alec and her encounter with her future husband, Angel, that Tess feels most deje! cted. &quot;The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary&quot; (Hardy 100). Indeed, Mother Nature is the only place where Tess can attain &quot;absolute mental liberty&quot; from all her worldly troubles (Hardy 100) and where she can find her peace of mind.After her seduction by Alec, Tess gathers her strengths, recollects herself, and starts a new life as a milkmaid in a quiet countryside at a farm called Talbothays. This is a deliberate attempt on Tess's part to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of another event on such a castatrophic scale. Now, working closely with nature (cows to be specific), she has succeeded in &quot;shunning mankind&quot; (Hardy 101), and truly believes that she is laying a new foundation for her future (Hardy 124). Surrounded by serene natural settings, this &quot;fresh and virginal daughter of Nature&quot; (Hardy 137) finds tranquillity in her surroundi! ngs despite the fact that she is in the midst of misery. In! Tess's eyes, nature is beautiful because it brings her joy-- and because it is where she belongs to.Angel comes from a very religious and educated family. Although he would never think of &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity for religion (Hardy 284), he is in actuality a very convention-bound individual. The moral code and the &quot;arbitrary law of society&quot; (Hardy 297) that accompany religion are deeply rooted in Angel's thinking. His presence at Talbothays disturbs the natural settings with the social customs he brings into the village &quot;which had no foundation in nature&quot; (Hardy 297). Hardy introduces Angel into the novel in order to signal a transition in Tess's life. Unfortunately, it is a transition for the worse. From this point on, as Tess' and Angel's relationship grows, Tess's relationship with nature, which has come to symbolize all that is good for her, has declined in proportion. Tess has allowed her relationship with the society (Angel) to take prec! edence over that with nature (by falling in love with and marrying Angel).&quot;Nightfall, which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer, as a lover&quot; (Hardy 368). Angel's passion for Tess in the summer does not carry beyond its boundary. Tess's dream of a happy life is shattered into a thousand pieces when her worst nightmare comes true-- Angel is unable to accept her past. As Tess's mental state changes, so does her perception of nature. The beautiful scenery at her once cherished village of Talbothays is no more. &quot;The gold of the summer picture was now grey, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold&quot; (Hardy 269). In the place which Tess had once thought of as a place of rebirth after her disastrous experience with Alec, she now sees only the dullness and helplessness of a dead winter. Tess's view of nature is purely perceptual. What should have been natural-- fallen leaves and bare tree branches-- have become depre! ssing and unpleasant. These natural phenomena are, in truth! , nothing more than physical manifestations of her sadden and broken heart. Nature has taken on a melancholy outlook not because it is indeed melancholy but because Tess is projecting feelings upon it. This is Hardy's so-called &quot;psychological phenomenon.&quot;Another important method besides relating Tess' feelings with natural phenomena is the use of imagery to mirror Tess's own fate. In two instances, long before the end of the novel, the stage for the final act of Tess's life has already been inauspiciously set up. In the first instance, Tess is symbolized by different animals being hunted down in a field :&quot;[U]naware of the ephemeral nature of their (the animals') refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day, when, their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled together... till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every one put to death by the sticks! and stones of the harvesters&quot; (Hardy 103).Hardy speaks of &quot;doom that awaited them later in the day&quot;; Tess knows exactly what awaits her. &quot;She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little every day&quot; (Hardy 212). Tess, like these animals, is unable to defend herself from the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Tess's attempt to escape her fate in her &quot;refuge&quot; (Talbothays) proves to be futile. Without any question, Angel and Alec are the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Although they do not kill Tess in a physical sense, they must bear the responsibility of forcing her into the &quot;horrible narrowness.&quot; What is this &quot;horrible narrowness&quot;? It is the only option left for Tess to liberate herself once and for all from her past-- the killing of Alec (Hardy 406). Tess has done just that; and this is the fatal act t! hat destroy not only her past, but also her own ephemeral e! xistence.In the second instance, Hardy presents to the readers, in a graver tone, an even gloomier setting in which Tess is symbolized by pheasants-- also being hunted down: &quot;Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some stretched out-- all of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more&quot; (Hardy 296).One must admit that this scene best reflects and symbolizes the horrible experience Tess has gone through in the whole novel-- her struggle for survival, her indescribable agony, and finally, her &quot;luck&quot; that nature is unable to sustain her painful existence any longer. Hardy notes that the hunter of these birds has a &quot;blood-thirsty light in [his] eyes&quot; (Hardy 296). He is, however, civil and gentle for most! of the year-- except in autumn and winter (Hardy 296). This is where the change of seasons takes part in Hardy's shaping of a predetermined fate for Tess. Angel is &quot;civil and gentle&quot; to Tess during summer; but one also must also note that his rejection of her comes during winter. One can fairly say that Hardy leaves his readers no other choice but to convict Angel as the killer of Tess. He presents the end of Tess in his bloody account of the pheasants. In doing so, Hardy has revealed the unshakable destiny of his protagonist.Hardy is able to make use of his materialization of both the mental and fatalistic elements in the novel through his clever descriptions of nature to draw a portrait of a great tragic heroine. In the face of unbearable misery, only nature testifies to the sad story of this simple country girl. The speechless speaks for the inside of Tess. And the readers have been given a chance to realize that what will come is predetermined and inevitable.!Reference: Hardy, Thomas. Tess of the D'Urbervilles. New!

What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

When Angel finally repents and sees how he is wrong, it is too late. Tess has already fallen back into sin with the man who caused her to fall many years before. Once she finds out Alec has deceived her, she not only despises him, she kills him. I just thought it was a good way to say that there are always consequences for our actions. I kept wishing the whole book that she had told Angel about her past before she married him. It would have spared them a lot of grief. I think he would have handled it better and hopefully been man enough to forgive her. It would have saved a lot of the grief that came later. What was really bad was how hypocritical Angel was when he confessed his own sin, she forgave him; yet when she confesses hers, he cast her out of his life.

Infantile criticisms by teenagers (who might change their minds later) disrupt the rating system used by Amazon. The fascinating aspect of Hardy - in this work, as well as in others is the manner that Charaters and setting intertwine. Relationships are seemingly established but what renders Hardy a literary tragedian is his capacity of substantiating the relationships into pre-determined moulds; the ending is somewhat predictable but the psychology leading to it and how it is developed is the interesting part. My only problem with Hardy is how he characterizes Brazil - Curitiba and then follows with him being in Rio de Janeiro. I would have liked to see more written about the actual experience there - but that is a minor complaint. PS - for some of the readers out there: Brazil is NOT just a rainforest. There are dry plains, extensive wetlands, moutainous forests (not the same as rain forests), snowy peaks, deserts, etc..."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess is such a weak character, one you'd love to hate.

He sends his older daughter, Tess, to live with the D'Urbervilles, unaware that the current family of D'Urbervilles are imposters.At the home of these imposters, Tess is raped by the eldest D'Urberville son, Alec. She flees and gives birth to a child conceived by the rape. The infant dies and Tess buries him in secret.In an attempt to escape her past and start anew, Tess takes a milkmaid job at Talbothay's Dairy where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Angel is a beautiful man who loves Tess deeply, but when he proposes to her, she is torn between lying to him by omission versus telling him of her past with Alec -- a choice that would likely alienate him in the strict morals of Victorian Britain.After they are married, Tess breaks down and tells Angel of her shameful past. Angel can't cope with it and leaves Tess penniless to travel to Brazil. When both Angel and Alec return to her, she is faced with the choice between them and the disastrous consequences of her decisions.Overall, I was disappointed by the lack of theme. The story is just unrelenting bleak, which wouldn't have bothered me except there didn't really seem to be a point to it. A lot of the text is spent repeating things that really didn't need to be repeated, especially in the entire section devoted to the lead-up to Tess agreeing to marry Angel. We knew it was going to happen, so I quickly lost interest in all tension-building that didn't really build any tension.I guess it might have been about the tragic fate of principled people. Tess is a moral woman, she desires only to be happy -- and both lead her to nothing but tragedy. I realize this was a bit cutting edge in the late 19th century when people wanted their stories to have happy endings no matter what happened in the middle. But explorations on the unfairness of life are only realistic if they rest on the capriciousness of fate. Murphy's Law just doesn't kick the hell out of people like it does to Tess.There is the class confusion element; the \\"what constitutes a true gentleman?\\"; the critique of basing the aristocratic label on either blood or money. But, really, I'm getting burned out on the theme that poor people are just inherently better than everyone else. It's not realistic so it doesn't do much for the development of a class conscience.There isn't even any feminist theme. Men dominate Tess her entire life, but this isn't the factor that leads to any of Tess' problems. Her problems are shown to be entirely the work of cruel fate (who apparently has it in for her to an extreme degree).Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. This is just what really prevented me from really loving it. I did enjoy the story and the writing itself. I just think there are better classics out there."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I did not lose any weight, however.

The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires \\"cousin\\" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just \\"confessed\\" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a \\"bad woman,\\" but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now \\"impure\\" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess is typical of Hardy heroines, pathetic/victim.

I love this story passionatly. It is so easy to identify with Tess, hate Alec and be ashamed of Angel. I only hate that Tess has to pay for her wrong doing as it is so hard to sympathize with Alec or to find anything redeaming in him. I love some of the passages in the book that show Tess's ideals, compassion, and proud nature, like when she takes sympathy on the injured quails by puting them out of their misery. It is odd but it shows part of Tess's selfless nature and endears her to the reader. The story also has much to say about hypocrisy with out being preachy.

They make bad decisions, and suffer for them, and we suffer along with them. How refreshing!This book is incredibly rich, and there would be much to discuss in a class or book group. I actually think one of the most interesting characters is Alec d'Urbervilles. He is utterly contemptible, of course, but he goes through such changes in the book that he's fascinating to watch. A great bad guy.Not surprisingly, Tess's and Angel's theme, the Double Standard one, shows up all over the place. I caught 3/4 of Sweet Charity on TV last night, remember that one with Shirley McClaine? Great dance numbers. She confesses her past in a fit of passion, and guess what happens? A scene certainly as heart-wrenching as the one in the crumbling d'Urbervilles mansion.If you love classics, what are you waiting for? It's worth it, as are Hardy's other novels. If you are new to this sort of thing, reading it for a course or a class, you have a treat in store. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel makes a heroine out of a simple girl. Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a nearly extinct noble line, leads a life of heavy responsibility where her impoverished family is concerned. At the behest of her parents, she seeks assistance from the D'Urbervilles who are, supposedly, relatives. This assistance yields disastrous results and Tess feels compelled to find work as a milkmaid where she meets Angel Clare, the son of an evangelical pastor, who is gathering experience in order to become a farmer.Hardy does a splendid job of illustrating Tess's strength as she goes from innocent girl to pure woman. Though she is not as educated as Angel, in terms of theory, her experience with Alec Stokes D'Urberville has given her a deeper knowledge of life and acceptance. Ironically, it is this experience which captivates and, predictably enough, repulses Angel.Hardy's narrative is a powerful one in this particular tale. It is clear that this is Tess's story and we, as readers, witness her painful journey. Through his subtle and understated use of irony, we come to realize the hypocrisy of Angel and wonder about the diabolical nature of Alec.What Hardy does emphasize in this novel is the unwavering hand of Justice which allows the novel to come to a bittersweet end and lets no one escape its strong, yet objective, sense of judgement."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is a wonderful book written by Thomas Hardy.

I was actually weeping audibly at times. These characters are so real you feel as if you know them. I found myself yelling at them as if somehow I could intervene in their lives. Thomas Hardy is a poetic genious with the ability to create people and places vividly awake in your mind. Is there anyone out there who can write like this anymore?

In short, it is a passionate statement about man's cruelty to a woman.This book understands the differences between man and woman, and for the most part, it is not complimentary to men. Exceptions exist. \\"The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.\\"And during the hard times inflicted upon her, Tess refuses to reproach those men who made her life a miserable existence. It starts with her father, whose newfound nobility engage him in a mead house where he misses a deadline, requiring her to carry on the family business, which results in a horrible accident and family economic loss. From there, she must endure hard work, be sexually mistreated by an employer, move away from her castigated self from a problem to which she had no cause, live a life as a simple milk maid, and then marry.When she marries, it seems that all is well. But, her husband, when discovering during their honeymoon that her flower was violated (even though without permission) by one before him, immediately exiles himself to Brazil and leaves her in poverty and public humiliation. Her life is not good - and she knows it: to the point where she contemplates suicide.But, one day, when walking in the woods she sees maimed birds (hunting's collateral damage) which slowly walk about to a cruel and painful demise. When seeing their tortured final moments on earth, she says, \\"Poor darlings - to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o' such misery as yours!\\" \\"And not a twinge of bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and not bleeding, and I have two hands to feed and clothe me.\\" She is miserable, but she understands the relativity of such emotion.Men in this book really have to take the blame. Like the hunters who irresponsibly leave half-shot birds to limp to their graves, her husband must atone for his terribly misguided and failed judgment of her and her unwelcomed sexual experience. She was by modern standards too young to consent, and certainly did not consent. And, after years of review of the issue, her husband concludes what modern men would have been capable of doing in moments - ask for her forgiveness and pity her. \\"Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.\\"But, this is not a love story with undertones of happy endings. Shakespearean in many ways, devoted to tragic ending, this book raises the title character to sainthood. And, like most tragedies, only the cold can complete the final pages without welled eyes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", first published in 1891, is set in Dorset (or \\"South Wessex\\" as Hardy called it) during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It tells the story of Teresa (\\"Tess\\") Durbeyfield, a beautiful and innocent country girl who is seduced by a wealthy gentleman, gives birth to his illegitimate child, and is eventually, after numerous vicissitudes of fortune, hanged for his murder.This was a controversial subject in late Victorian England, although perhaps not as controversial as we might think. Today we like to flatter ourselves that all great nineteenth century writers were effectively twenty-first century spirits avant la lettre, voices crying out in the wilderness against the hypocritical moral code of their contemporaries, and therefore doomed to be misunderstood by a scornful bourgeoisie. The truth is always more complex than that. In the case of \\"Tess\\", the subject of illegitimacy and unmarried motherhood was not unprecedented in English literature; Dickens, for example, had dealt with it in \\"Bleak House\\", as had Elizabeth Gaskell in \\"Ruth\\". The reception afforded to the novel was by no means uniformly hostile; indeed, Hardy himself admitted in the preface to a later editions that \\"by far the majority\\" of reviewers had \\"generously welcomed the tale\\".Hardy was a countryman, and all of his novels are set in the rural area of South-West England which he named Wessex. He had not only a deep feeling for the English countryside but also the ability to convey this feeling in vivid descriptive prose. This is not, however, mere description for description's sake; the landscape becomes a vital part of the structure of his novels- at times it can almost be regarded as a character in them- and Hardy uses description of the natural scene in order to amplify his descriptions of his characters' feelings.There are two passages in \\"Tess\\" which particularly exemplify this. The first comes when the heroine, following the death of her illegitimate son, is working as a dairymaid on a farm in the Frome valley in southern Dorset; it is here that she meets Angel Clare, the man who is to become the great love of her life. The second comes when Tess has been abandoned by Angel, after he discovered the truth about her past, and is forced to find work on a farm on the Dorset Downs, slightly further north. The scenes set in the valley take place in summer, and Hardy's writing is dominated by images of heat, of ease, of fertility and of luxuriant growth, symbolising the burgeoning growth of Tess's hopes for her future happiness. The scenes set on the bare, stony Downs take place in winter, and the imagery is of cold, of hardship and of bleakness, symbolising the dashing of those hopes.In this novel Hardy's powers of description are matched by his powers of characterisation. There have been few, if any, male English novelists who have had such a gift for creating memorable female characters- Dickens' heroines are pale and insipid by comparison- and Tess is perhaps his greatest. The author used to speak of her as though she were a real person, and wrote \\"I have not been able to put on paper all that she is, or was, to me\\". If it were possible to fall in love with a fictional character, I would have fallen in love with Tess and so, I suspect, would most of Hardy's readers.Another feature of the book is that it reads as both of its time and timeless. It is not set in some unchanging Arcadian landscape but in the real English countryside of the late nineteenth century, a period of rapid social change. Agriculture was becoming increasingly mechanised; one key scene takes place while Tess is operating a steam-powered threshing machine. The position of the traditional landed gentry was being challenged by the rise of a new moneyed class, a phenomenon illustrated by the history of Tess's own family. The start of her tragedy is the discovery, by a local antiquary, that she is a descendant of the aristocratic and once-powerful d'Urberville family, of whose surname her own is a corruption. Her seducer goes by the name Alec d'Urberville, and Tess mistakenly believes him to be a distant cousin, but in reality he is neither a relation nor an aristocrat, but a parvenu. His father, a wealthy financier from Northern England, changed the family name (originally Stoke) when he purchased a Dorset country estate.The countryside has also been changed by new learning and ways of thinking which have challenged the power of old ideas. Although Tess is from a poor family, she is significantly better educated than her parents' generation. Hardy describes the gulf between Tess and her simple, superstitious mother Joan as being as great as that between the Victorian and Jacobean eras. Angel, the freethinking son of a pious clergyman, represents the growing force of religious scepticism, although his views on sexual morality turn out to be just as puritanical as those of his father's generation. Indeed, Angel's Puritanism may be connected with his personal philosophy; he seems to have kept the Christian injunction to hate the sin while rejecting that to love the sinner.The book's timeless quality derives partly from Hardy's prose style, formal even by the standards of Victorian novelists (although Hardy can be demotic when writing dialogue for his rustic characters). This style is characterised by an elevated vocabulary and by allusions to the Bible, to Greek and Roman mythology and to Shakespeare and other English poets. These allusions help to create the idea that Tess is not just a Victorian country girl but also a tragic heroine comparable to the heroes of Shakespeare or Aeschylus. Tess's downfall can partly be attributed to the social structures of her day, which made it all too easy for a rich man like Alec to take advantage of a poor girl, but also to a tragic flaw. She may be pure and innocent, but she is also a poor judge of character, too besotted with Angel to realise how priggish and self-centred he is, making excuses for him even after his callous rejection of her.Having recently reviewed Manzoni's \\"I Promessi Sposi\\", widely considered the Great Italian Novel, I started wondering what might be considered the Great British Novel, and thought I would celebrate my 100th review for Amazon by putting forward my own candidate for that honour. The book is a complex one, both in terms of its plot and of its themes, and there has not been space to do full justice to these aspects in this brief review. What I have tried to do is to set out some of the reasons why Hardy is my favourite novelist and why I regard this as the greatest of his novels. I cannot think of another novel with so loveable a central character, nor one whose plight has affected me so deeply. This is a work of immense emotional power."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy, who wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles, also wrote one of my favorite poems, The Blinded Bird, and another wonderful one called The Darkling Thrush. He has beautiful gift for words, character development, and emotional imagery. He has some vivid descriptions of the passion of love and the beauty of life. As many critics complain, Hardy seems to view life with some skepticism. He seems to believe that life is hard and people sometimes are not treated fairly by the very ones who should be there to help and protect the hurting. This philosophy parallels the feeling of many people that the Church has hurt them. A friend of mine wrote an impassioned essay about the personal pain she and others had experienced through transgressions of the Church.The difference is that she recognized a loving, all-knowing God who loves us deeply and whose love is sometimes not reflected in his people - whereas Hardy's story reflects the world's perception that a callous church represents an absent God. Still, I detect in his writing a subtle thread of hope as reflected by the hope of his characters, though not by their plight. I appreciated this book because it made me realize I am the hands and feet for the people in the world whose hope is gone.Anyone who hurts for others will be as greatly frustrated if you read this book. But you will also gain so much if you keep the perspective that God is in control and cares deeply about every person's plight. In this story, I see the undying faith Tess had in Clare as a picture of the way our faith in Christ should be, and the kind of love I want to have in another person.Tess' pain would not have been so hard to bear if the church had acted toward her as Jesus acted toward tax collectors and sinners in Luke 15, and as the people in those three parables acted. If the Church had applied the anxious determination of one who has lost an important object, Tess would have received the support she needed during her time of hurt. It makes me ponder the question: What will I do for the hurting Tess's of the world?"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The story is well known; one can choose from many editions or printings. If given the choice, choose Norton Critical Editions for the classics.This edition includes factual background provided by Hardy's pre-eminent biographer, Michael Millgate, who opines on the \\"originals of, and models for, Tess Durbeyfield.\\" Absolutely fascinating.Critical essays include contemporary criticism: Robert Louis Stevenson panned it; Henry James enjoyed it despite it being \\"chock-full of faults and falsity.\\"Virginia Woolf's six-page essay regarding \\"Tess\\" is worth the price of this edition.But most illuminating is the verbatim interview with Thomas Hardy himself concerning the ending of the story. When asked why he gave \\"Tess\\" the ending he did, he answered: \\"For the simple reason I could not help myself...When I got to the middle of the story the characters took their fates into their own hands, and I literally had no power.\\"Reading \\"Tess\\" without the supplementary material and criticism will leave you having enjoyed a most wonderful buffet but having missed out on the dessert.One will also get so much more enjoyment from \\"Tess\\" if one reads either Millgate's or Martin Seymour-Smith's biography of Thomas Hardy. I prefer the latter."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book will capture you and pull you in as you follow Tess Durbeyfeild, the blameless rape victim whose tragic jounrey through Wessex, England brings her love, despair, comedy (yes, there is some), friendships, tears, self-awareness, empowerment, but ultimately tragedy.This book is sad...yes, but Thomas Hardy's poetic prose litterally makes the insides of the reader do summersaults. This story printed on the pages of \\"Tess\\" are more than a novel, they are a portal into the world of a blameless woman. You'll feel the pain of these characters, escpeically our heroine Tess."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"One favorable evening, Tess in her white garb attends May-Day dance in sleepy town of Marllott. A passerby not used to sophistication will incline to notice her. It is not the extravagance, nay the ostentatiousness of the girl's beauty, but the softness in spirit and demeanor conspicuous on her big, beautiful eyes that sets her apart. The same passerby endowed with experience will not pinpoint Tess among the young, comely girls as someone prone to vicissitude of tragedies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Tess Durbeyfield later known in the novel as Tess d'Urberville is the hapless victim if not the heroine of this tragic tale. Born from poor parents, she is whisk away to work for the rich d'Urberville family. There she meets Alec, the handsome scion of d'Urbervilles clan. His incessant seduction of the young maiden results in violation of her rights. Forlorn, she returns home to the embarrassment of her parents and her neighbors. Stripped of clear prospect in life, she travels miles and miles away to be a milkmaid. While in the vast dairy field of Thalbothay, Tess falls madly in love with Angel Clare, the fledgling agriculturist of noble descent, convinced to make the newcomer his wife. Thus the journey that leads Tess from one farm to another is side by side with her lamentations over the two Englishmen and becomes her heart's landscape that stretches beyond endurance.Hardy, an architect by tuition, molds his male characters in an anvil of insensitivity. Their frozen hearts incapable of thawing by burning tears of a woman's pleading. As to his female character like Tess, Hardy constructs her similar to obelisk with solid foundation of faith that gradually narrows at the peak.Unsurprisingly, Victorian society scorned Hardy when this novel came out in 1891. The way he chose to describe Tess and her violation were less subtle in comparison to Eliot's writings. At present society however, Thomas Hardy is as impeccable as the clock ticking on the wall. He is in command of his story as if time is in command of denizens elsewhere. Under no circumstance he pauses to please his readers. He continues and takes them where nothing exists but the certainty of time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is among the best novels I have read when judged on its purely literary merits. Hardy's command of imagery in his creation of the nuanced satire of society and the values it imposes upon Victorian women is outstanding. And, Hardy uses nature to structure the novel and reflect the plot. He is also able to introduce a fatalist approach to the characters' actions that flows seamlessly with his characterization of them. However, Tess is more than an invaluable piece of English literature.Tess of the D'Urbervilles is also a strong insight into the forces of nature that shape our lives. It is a tale about the unlucky girl Tess, who has to endure suffering on two fronts: from the man who takes advantage of her, and the man who rejects her. She is symbolic of the person within us all, who is oppressed by the outside world, and depressed from within. She is humanity, and her story will speak to anyone who reads this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I read this in about 8 hours. I loved the prose, the descriptions, the whole feel of the book. I have to say I have a hard time with the type of heroine who just lets things happen to her like this. You know the characters I am referring to---I mean this book was kind-of like an 8 hour train wreck. I knew what was going to happen, well, at least that it wouldn't have a happy ending. But the writing is so great I couldn't help myself!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book has touched me in a very different way than many others have. It is a tragic story and envelopes the reader in a different kind of sadness - a sadness which one cannot pull out of quickly or just draw aside. Many thoughts contained in this book are worthy of reflection. Each lingers in your heart. The happy moments are all tinged with a bitter taste. Each character is flawed as a natural human being and each mistake they make reflects on their future and affects them drastically. Tess Durbeyfield is one of the most tragic characters I have ever read of. From the moment she leaves her home to the supposed D'Urberville relatives, she is pushed into catastrophes and heartaches that just lead to more doom. I recommend this book to any reader who is willing to undergo the myriad of emotions that accompanies Tess's journey through demise. It is not for the flippant, unconcerned, and unsympathetic reader. Everything that happens to Tess happens for a reason, and the reader must be able to realize how each affects her to appreciate this book. Read this book and expect to ponder on many philosophical wonderings. This book WILL affect you! It is worthy of any person seeking a deep and life-affecting novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"My review is based on the Oxford Classics Edition.Thomas Hardy seems to have been interested mostly in sad, unhappy characters who lead troubled, disappointing lives, struggle against fate, and lose. There is beauty in artistically represented sadness, though, and notably so if we are only spectators. I am not giving away the ending by writing that &quot;Tess&quot; is a sad novel. I think most people who choose to read this book do so because they know it is a sad story, or they have read Hardy before. In my case, I had to read it for school, and what truly surprised me is the ambiguity that Hardy so masterfully portrays in order to make his heroine more of a real person instead of a mere character. By the book's end we really do not know whether Tess was raped or seduced by Alec; whether he took advantage of a sleeping girl and forced himself upon her, or she allowed it in a moment of weakness, tired after a strenous day and grateful to him for &quot;saving&quot; her from the other workers. However it happened, Tess's life is radically changed after the fact and this event will have grave consequences for her and Alec.The ambiguity is troubling with the entrance of Angel, the hypocrite who falls in love with Tess because she looks angelic, virginal, and beautiful as a child, but rejects her when she tells him that she is not a virgin (therefore not a child) anymore. Her other qualities are there, but Angel equates purity with virginity --something many people still do when it refers to women-- so he can construct a perfect excuse for his terrible behaviour towards the woman he has said he loved. In spite of the forebodings that Hardy drops before Chapter 35, this particular chapter, at the beginning of Phase the Fifth, is very powerful and almost surprising in its intensity. The level of troubling ambiguity goes up several notches at the end of the novel, when it appears that Angel may indeed get his &quot;little girl&quot; as a replacement for the one he just lost.&quot;Tess&quot; is a sad and beautiful story. There is much more to write about this novel, but I have decided to concentrate on what Hardy seems to have intended when he wrote so beautifully about so sad a theme, but in such an ambiguous way. He calls Tess &quot;A Pure Woman,&quot; and she is that. But as only a truly great writer would, he does not present her as an outright victim: there are plenty of opportunities for Tess to escape Alec before they have sex, and plenty of opportunities for her to deal in a different way with the cruel hand that fate has dealt her. She does not escape Alec, and she chooses Angel (rotten luck with men). There are tragic flaws in Tess, and that is what makes her human while making &quot;Tess&quot; into a true tragedy. Hardy knows this. His prose is elegant and, at times, it reads more like poetry, going from good to beautiful.This edition of the novel is helpful, but it could be better. I prefer foot-notes rather than end-notes. If they have to be end-notes, they should have numbers. The Introduction by Simon Gatrell is original, although I do not agree with its main premises: that there are two Thomas Hardys at work in &quot;Tess,&quot; and that &quot;A Pure Woman&quot; refers not to purity, but to &quot;essential, wholly&quot; woman. This is valid as an opinion but unsupported by evidence. I recommend &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles.&quot; If you have never read Hardy, read this. If you have read him, you know what to expect."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I was supposed to read this book 25 or so years ago in high school. It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says about its time and place."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"But if you get the Wordsworth Classics edition, don't read the introduction until you finish! I'm going to make this standard practice for all classics from now on. I was hoping for some background on Hardy but before I even realized what had happened I'd read a summary of the entire story in one paragraph, plot twists and all. And it really did ruin the climactic last couple chapters for me. I hate it when editors / publishers assume that if a novel is famous and critically acclaimed then the reader must already be familiar with the story. Completely false: In this day and age reading for pleasure isn't as widespread as it used to be and the old classics are fading into the distance. The story in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is certainly not common knowledge anymore, so when you discover a gem like this I beg you not to ruin it for yourself by reading the canned introduction.Still a fabulous read, certainly. The story centers on the simple, sincere, hard-working farmgirl Tess Durbeyfield who is fated to stumble into a few serious and unfortunate challenges over the couple years that the novel spans. Hardy spins a truly magnificently written and plotted tale in narrating poor Tess's adventures & mishaps.I read another Hardy classic, Far From the Madding Crowd, several years ago and enjoyed it immensely. For the life of me I can't remember any of the story in that novel except that the central character was rather strange, but a few pages of \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" instantly resurrected my memories of Hardy's unmatched power of narration. He truly brings every scene and character to full animation and vitality, does the poignant scenes full justice, and even handles humorous situations with aplomb.Easily five stars, one of the best classics I've ever read. Just don't read the introduction!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is a classic novel that is one of the saddest. It involves a very likeable, innocent country girl who is seduced by a cruel employer. She has a child by that union that dies early in infancy. She later meets a man who loves her but upon learning her past rejects her. She then meets up again with the first man, who forces her to be his mistress. The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery. Hardy is a master of both, and of the human drama."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as \\"damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around\\"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"if i'm being truly honest most 'classics' leave me cold. Pride and prejudice ? Bored me rigid. The amabassadors ? A guaranteed way to induce sleep. Remembrance of things past ? Still only read two of the books...and have no real desire to read more So when i picked up tess i was expecting more of the same. Worthy, intellectual, dull .I was wrong . Tess was a page turner , populist in the best way and strangely, considering cinema hadn't been invented yet , rather cinematic in it's description and creation of scenes . Even the passages that described the countryside add to the overall feel and mood of the book, rather than just describe for describing sake . As for the reviewers who accuses Hardy of being verbose, I can only say that for the time he's positvely Hemingwayesque.Yes, the book is a little melodramtic and if it wasn't for all the tragedy and downbeat ending you could see it being made into a mini series on tv but frankly.... what's wrong with that ? It's precisely this approachability that lets Hardy get you thnking about issues like women's rights , men and women's relation to each other and predeterminism.Finally to those that say Angel and Alec's behaviour is inconsistent .I can not agree. Alec is exactly the kind of person who rushes from one passionate extreme to another and Angel is exactly the kind of idealist who has trouble excepting the realities of life and the failings of the average person.Finally a word on Tess herself .She is one of the sexiest characters i've ever seen written in victorian fiction .It interests me that a man should write such a character and then have her killed as if such beauty (both internally and externally) can't be allowed to exist on the earth becuase of men like him, me and maybe you...."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Bleak and depressing, as far as the plot is concerned it's sort of like Hardy was experimenting with how many terrible things he could make happen to a trusting, wonderful person, until she's finally crushed under the weight of the world and her society. Really makes you feel awful to read it, honestly, but that's ok because the writing is beautiful and the structure is flawless. There are moments of pure poetry on a Shakespearean level, that make you want to weep for all humanity. The characters, especially Tess, are very believable, and the psychology effecting their decisions is what drives the story, for me. I'm impressed, I'm going to read more Hardy. I've looked around and it seems like most of his books are similar - a great set-up to a disaster, all the while people's hearts being ripped out of their chests and their hopes and dreams crushed one after another by a cruel world and cruel circumstances. He obviously had a pretty tragic and pessimistic view of our human situation, but a view that must have filled him with sympathy. He really goes into his characters' heads and makes you feel their pain through it all, going through the stages of their grief, with really amazing descriptions that feel dead on. Or at least that's what he did in this book.Also, it's pretty amazing that he blatantly pointed out the sexual double standards of his time and their utter hipocrysy. It's so crazy that people in Hardy's day were outraged after the publication of this book by the subtitle, \\"A Pure Woman,\\" because Tess was raped. When you keep in mind how firmly these ideas of purity and female sexuality were implanted in people's minds, it makes the plot completely believable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today.

That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction.

And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy is an extraordinary writer; though his writing is poetic, and includes on point historical references, he is an imaginative and thoughtful storyteller. Hardy reveals Tess's soul with such care and regard that she is irresistibly complex; delicate and strong willed, deeply loyal and obstinately independent, yet submissive and capable of extreme violence. So well did I come to understand her that, over time, I could predict her reactions and decisions -- though I hoped she would decide otherwise. Once a preacher reveals to Tess's father his connection to a long lost prominent family, Tess's is life is set on a seemingly unalterable path. Used, manipulated, misjudged and shamed, she struggles on, grinding out a living in unspeakably harsh conditions, while resisting with all her might a man who had already stolen her innocence and would shamelessly destroy her soul as she waiting for the man who had abandoned her. I found myself wincing at her pain, hoping she would receive what she deserved rather than what life seemed intent on doling out to her. Perhaps the best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" is, well, the story about Tess of the D'Urbervilles, a \\"simple,sensuous and passionate\\" peasant girl whose maturation into a woman has tremendous antipathy to its brim. The transfiguration of \\"a fine and handsome\\" country lass into a blooming woman with hapless consequences is the theme of this the most ambitious tragic Hardyan novel and the artistic flair of the late Victorian novelist blended with the subtle craftsmanship transcends the individual concern into one of the society.The proposition involved in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" first published in 1891 in three volumes has a tragic enough diction as we get it so clearly throughout the 550 or so odd pages of the book. It is to contract the unending horizon of the human life into a miniscule and apparently insignificant domain of an individual, who's inexperienced, unsophisticated, candid and uncanny. Tess Durbeyfield is a meek, submissive sixteen-and-a-half year old country girl with several siblings, a dissipated father and an illusioned mother living in the village of Marlott in the county of 19th. century fictitious Wessex,Hardy's eternal refuge from the real world outside. The chance discovery of John Durbeyfield from Parson Tringham, the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane, of his ancestral line of D'Urbervilles and a freak accidnt culminating in the death of one of his horses for which Tess herself shouldrs the blame sends the eponymous protagonist of this darkly compelling drama to find monetary solace in the wealthy Mrs. D'Urberville. As if the exploitation of the have nots in terms of financial issues weren't enough, the poor peasant girl from the poor \\"blighted\\" Durbeyfield family is seduced by Mrs. D'Urberville's sensual and lustful son Alec. Alec shuns her, Tess becomes pregnant, the child passes away in infancy, the unmarried mother mother starts working as a diarymaid in a farm, the Talbothays, falls in love with Angel Clare, the rector's son.....the whole flow of the tyde has a strangely familiar suspicion about itself and it's actually Thomas Hardy's exceptional gift for exploring a relatively small setting to compile a general drama of human life that transpires real tragic proportions from a fictitious figure.Art is indeed often illusory, sometimes it's even a whisper of the urge of reformation; but in more probabilities than one, art is symbolic, a sign of much deep-seated intent. The genuine accomplishment of all forms of art---be it literature, painting,sculpture,music or much else---is to portray the vastness of the human expanse in the most trimmed space and geniuses of all ages in all spheres of art have managed to do just that. Van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers\\" and \\"The Starry Night\\" are more symbolic than cliches, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" is the depiction of social turmoil in 19th. century Russia, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" is a journey through a distorted and divided soul's mind and Eric Clapton's song \\"Tears of Heaven\\" is the ultimate homage to our passed away beloved ones. \\"Tess of the D'Urbevilles\\" too is a metaphor for agonies, humiliations, inward and outward strifes, twists and turns in life and the ultimatum. The unprecedented and nihilistically conspiring turn of events that Tess encounters in her hard and lonely life could've been thrown to anyone in general and any woman of any age in particular and through Tess's character as well as through the brilliant evocation of the fictional Wessex landscape and people, Hardy stags \\"the ache of modernism\\"in the novel.This abyss of \\"the ache of modernism\\" is aptly poured into the images of the rustic realm and the ascend of the morally and spiritually corrupt. Nowhere in the book is this concept clearer than in the nature of the shrewd and machiavellian Alec D'Urberville. A sinful man come to no good by demolishing an unsuspecting girl's life, Alec is also a preacher of the Gospels in his so-called reformed stage. But all his baser passions are aroused on seeing Tess after four years and he turns into a wolf once more: \\"Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife, you are mine!\\" This to a Tess whose innocent flaw of revealing her horrendous past to Angel on their weddind night had caused their subsequent separation and 'the deserted wife\\"-'s struggle in sustaining hr livelihood. The typical male sexual desires and possessive phyche is symbolized in Angel Clare whose own sinful past is acceptable but not Tess's unconditioned misery.Throughout the novel, the bounteous description of the landscape, the environment and Nature keeps the reader spell-bound at the author's immense imaginative power, marvellous visualisation skill and abundant choice of similes and metaphors and aptly used words. Yet the language and mood always maintain a touch of pessimism and not even spares the simple, unrestrained and self-sacrificing friendship of Marian,Retty Priddle,Izz Huett and Tess.Hardy is barely good at analysing characters and that is vividly exposed towards the end of the novel. Angel returns from Brazil and scampers to rejoin with \\"a cottage-girl, his young wife\\" only to find her with Alec D'Urberville once again. In utter desperation of realising that she was taken in by Alec with morbid promises about her dishevelled family, Tess kills him and then elopes with Angel nly to be caught within a short span of time and be hanged. Such a sudden turnaround of events is too confusing and leaves one wondering whether more words and pages should've been devoted to such critical situations. The reader rues too the missingdescription of Tess's and Angel's marriage as much as the incomplete pictored characters' change of notions.That the end of the novel is a befitting tribute, be it poetically just, tragic or sarcastic, to the three major characters is a Jack jumping out of the box. Alec's sin is too much for this world to bear and so he dies; Tess's life is too inundated with misery, despair, responsibility and uncertainty and so she meets with a tragic end; Angel's puritan perspective finds him a pure, genteel partner in the shape of Tess's younger sister Liza-Lu.What adds jewels to the crown are the dramatic effects installed into the novel to make the reader approach the chain of events with a sigh and regret. What if Tess's written confession pushed under Angel's door hadn't gone under the carpet? Surely the tragic aftermath could've been bypassed. Again, had Tess not overheard her husband's brothers' critical approach to her, she would've surely met with her in-laws and her life would've turned over a new leaf. But tragedy is always concentrated on inevitability and waivering of the obvious and so it is in the case of Tess, the \\"little fool\\".The fate of an unassuming girl \\"put to by an Enemy in the shape of a friend' and played from one court to another and back again like a shuttlecock isn't rare enough but what's rare is the quality of Hardy to paint a solemn picture about the essence of the issue. True, the book does often become a laboured read and provokes a deep pang of pain, anger, frustration, resentment, resentment and a rebellious intent,but the reader cannot help but fel that \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is \\"a new kind of beauty, a beauty of tragic tone\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Probably Hardy's most famous work and definitely containing his most sympathetic heroine. Takes direct aim at the class system and gender roles and forces the reader to see stark differences between what is socially acceptable and what is socially ridiculed. Note how Tess is blamed for her past more than Alec is, when it's Alec's fault Tess ends up as she does. A final ultimate retribution does surface but of course, at the expense of Tess's future. She's heartbreaking here, especially when she writes to Angel, pleading for his love and forgiveness. You can feel every second of her plight , right down to the harsh outdoor work she's forced to endure in order to stay alive. All dust, sweat and fatigue... Supporting characters are as vivid as the main ones... This may be Hardy's most complete and upsetting story. He really puts the players (thus the audience) thru the ringer."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"it truly is an amazing story of love, strength, passion and second chances. I loved it and got into it quite quickly. The characters were developed flawlessly, and the plot is one to remember. Though at times the descriptions of the setting did tend to drag, it didnt take much away from this great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Ok, this one is for all my friends at BHS. We read this book in class, and the book wasn't bad, but that is a hard thing to tell when you haven't read through the book because your english teacher doesn't encourage it enough because the students make the quizes for each phase. EVERYONE cheated. It was good. If she spent more time on teaching correctly rather than perming and afro-ing her hair, maybe we'd have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I had read this book about 25 years ago whilst a student in high school for A'Level Literature(Grade 11-12 - Jamaica, West Indies). Whilst reading the 50 Shades Trilogy recently, I noted the references to Tess in that book and it perked my interest in this book. I decided to re-read it as I really couldn't remember it much and wondered how I would interpret it now being more mature and experienced. Well suffice it to say that this book is devastatingly excellent! The language is hard to get at first (having not read a Thomas Hardy in a long time!).... it's a Thomas Hardy novel so you know he's very detailed and it's going to be tragic as he doesn't do happy ever after! The novel is set in Victorian England and features its heroine Tess a very poor country girl. It details her journey from innocent young girl on the cusp of womanhood to womanhood. It is essentially a love tragedy but not in the manner of Romeo and Juliett, its more, more real, more realistic. Its speaks to just how tragic life can be when the right man doesn't meet the right woman at the right time, about missed opportunities, and, depicts how the biggest of injustice and violation often happens to the most vulnerable and undeserving of persons. It speaks to how morals and society's beliefs can cause us pain and sorrow and often to punish those undeserving of same. But that was life then and its still so today. Suffice it to say that this book is 100 times better than the 50 Shades Trilogy and has impacted me so profoundly, I just can't understand how I didn't see the monumental tragedy it is when I was 17 years old. As a result I've taken to re-reading most of my literature books. This book is a must read for those who can manage."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Absolutely loved the story it's definitely worth reading through. I found some things a little difficult to follow because it's old English, but it was still a great read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I loved this book. The way hardy described some scenes left me in awe. If you are looking for classical writing and a great but tragic story you will love this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A wonderful book. Descriptive words and never a boring section. I truly loved this book and would recommend it to others, expecially if you are a lover of language."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the first Kindle book that I have read and I must say that the Kindle experience is better than I have thought - I read in the bright sunlight without getting tired.I first have heard of Tess in high school, but I didn't have the time or the mood to read it until now.Why I wanted to so much read it? Besides the fact that it is a classic - and I think that every teenager or young person in one's twenties must read it - I learned that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a pretty controversial novel when Thomas Hardy first released it. As we know from history and from literature courses, the Victorians considered themes such as sex, religion, the condition of women or the lives of the peasants taboo subjects. Fortunately we are more open-minded today and we don't make a big fuss of what's moral or not in books such as this one. I guess that Thomas Hardy had the intention to open the peoples' eyes - though it is a fictional story - that unfortunate things were happening to innocent girls during that time.The story is very realistic and the characters are complex.Tess is a free-spirited girl until her destiny changes and becomes more difficult. Tess swings between strength and weakness, between reason and her heart. I admire her capacity of dusting herself off and decide to find another place to work, in order to help her poor family. Although Angel is far away, her hope that he will come back someday does not leave her. I didn't like the fact that she constantly blamed herself for the first bad episode of her life which led her to other complicated situations. She felt guilty for something she wasn't aware of or she wasn't taught to avoid.The book also gives us a glimpse of how were the lives of peasants, and the depiction of the landscapes will appeal to those how love nature.I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin your reading.Therefore read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because you can enter in Tess' world and learn more about her troubles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I must admit that this is one of the few classics that I have not read, so when I found a free copy for my Kindle, I immediately downloaded it. And the story does not disappoint. Hardy is a master of taking you to a time in place in the past and uses verbage and setting descriptions that put you right in the story. Hardy's characters are brought to life and you feel as if you could know someone with these same characteristics in the here and now. The ending of this story, for me personally left something to be desired, but I really could not put it down. If you have not read this story, yet, please do!On a side note, I would love to see a contemporary adaptation of this story and see how the characters would interact with each other, as social standing, money, love, and betrayal are certainly themes worth examining in this day and age."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Should not be made into an afterschool special. Thomas Hardy is an excellent and verbose writer. Why use a few words to describe something when a whole page is more deft? Sometimes. Sometimes it is just a bit over the top. Good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic tragedy. Tess is so sweet you want to know her more and more, which led to shock after shock. I appreciated the footnotes and explanations at the end of the book. I also enjoyed Hardy's colorful descriptions. I was surprised at how similar life in thenineteenth century was to today's life."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The writing here is truly captivating. Hardy presents his principal characters in much the same way as other famous writers of his day; that is, the once nobled family,having fallen on hard times, now needs to be brought from the brink of disaster by marrying off one its daughters to someone of status. Tess does not dissapoint, in that she has spunk, principles, and a sense of duty. This story is filled with intrigue, unlikely loyalties, and an ending that will reward you for picking up this book.The bonus here is that I read the book for free on my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy really outdid himself with the creation of this novel. Tess is the quintessential protagonist to pity, sympathize with, and root for. Wronged by at least three men--her father, her cousin, and her husband--she remains pure in every sense by the corporeal. There is an overriding sense of despair that pervades the novel. Yet, what's a Hardy novel without that feeling?With this book, Hardy solidified his place as my favorite author. The author's ability to perfectly describe the English countryside, the charm, yet provinciality of the country folk, and the repressiveness of Victorian morals, makes this book one of his best. His subtlety often makes the reader question what it is that he just read, and leaves many things open to interpretation. Thus, as with many good texts, rereading it might lead to different understandings of different scenes that took place.All in all, there are few books that I have read that have made me want to give up sleep just to read them. I adored Tess, and I adore this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you. I can only highly recommed this book and will read it again and again..."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I have just finished reading all of the reviews for my most beloved book. Though most were supportive, there were a few that cut it down with extreme injustice. I read this book last year, when I was 13, no one made me read it, I was simply drawn to it. I was swept away once I got through the first chapter. To those who have never read it, I encourage you to ignore all of the bad reviews, and listen to the ones that loved it."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Out of all the book I was forced to read...I LOVED this one... the movie was good but the book was great...it is the only book I still have from my early Michigan college years."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],W={key:0},D={key:1};function B(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const F=d(M,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-aea01af2"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/4.md","filePath":"guide/4.md"}'),P={name:"guide/4.md"},E=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(F)]))}});export{j as __pageData,E as default};
