I know that I am not alone in my pain. Listening to others describe their disgust with WOT is so reaffirming.Robert Jordan's series has become the Titanic of American Literature; once filled with promise but now a pitiable heap at the bottom of many a landfill.Honest readers will admit there were clues to Jordan's poor writing even in the first books; mainly final chapters packed with rushed, super-extra-action! and female characters ALWAYS described the same way, (braid tugging, etc.)I feel sorry for Robert Jordan because he undoubtably reads the Amazon reviews. As do all his peers, friends and family. One-and-a-half stars after 1,800 reviews is a monumental humiliation.Please, Mr. Jordan, finish this series ASAP."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I want to applaud one reviewer (Oscar, &quot;honesty of a review [no spoilers]&quot;, January 15, 2004) for pointing out that many WOT fans reviewing &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; positively (3-5 stars) tend to do so based on the fact that they liked the series as a whole or that they believe the next book will be &quot;better&quot;. I've seen very few high ratings here that actually liked the book itself. Therefore, it is a bit ridiculous because it IS misleading. Like Oscar said, Amazon should really have a section to review the series as a whole. Meanwhile, I wish to join Oscar in asking fellow reviewers to keep in mind that customers reading yours reviews are typically reading them to find out if the particular item in question is worth purchasing. In this case that item is &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; NOT the entire series or any future installments. We have no way of knowing if the next book will be praisworthy until its release and, unless you're using a comparison of how the series has progressed since it's beginning (which the majority agree, went from 5-6 wonderful installments to swiftly decreasing in quality with each succeeding volume), simply rating this book -- in my opinion a terrible piece of literature -- five stars based on Robert's past work or to boost the rating isn't fair to those who have yet to spend their hard earned money on it.Now everyone has a right to their opinions and I respect the few who honestly enjoyed this book and rated it accordingly.Also, opinions lead to hypothesis and other comparisons, which is fine as long as it doesn't distract too much from the subject at hand. In other words, sometimes it's hard to keep perspective about something you've invested so much time, money, and energy in but WOT reviewers are typically very intelligent (you have to be to keep up with a series of this magnitude) and the majority, I've noticed, have amazingly managed to agree to a consensus. That consensus being that CoT is not worth buying."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What prompted me to write this review was the onslaught of negative reviews pertaining to this book. For the life of me I can't understand where this negativity is coming from. The #1 critisism of this series and this book is that it is to long. I have actually read 5 straight reviews insinuating that Jordan is pulling us along as a bigger part of his grander scheme, which is to suck as much money out of the fan base as possible.Come on people! Do you really think that is why there are so many books?This is where Jordan seperates the casual WOT fan from the genuine fans. He's not trying to make extra money by furthering the story at a slow pace.. Nope, he is telling it the way he wants. Many fans are turned off by the length, I, however, am not.. I want more. I want to be overloaded with character history and highly complex themes. Jordan is finally weeding out the ones who dont want the full experience and to those people i say fare well....Yes, i wish the final books would come out faster, but i will not take my frustration on the series. The funny thing is is that the same people who are ripping COT and the series by giving it 1 star are, for the most part, the ones that will be first in line at the book store when the new book comes out......Which fan are you? The one that sticks or the one that runs. The crossroads are in sight, which path will you chose?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series is most definitely running down, but without an end in sight. There are so many sub-plots, I believe that even a talented writer like Mr. Jordan is desperately trying to tie them all back together. I would not go as far as to say that this book is just a money grab, but it is getting very difficult to stay interested. It seems like the series is losing momentum, as if the end is near, yet there doesn't seem to be much pointing towards an quick ending. This is unfortunate as the books truly were quite good. I just feel that Mr. Jordan set his sights too high, thinking he could manage the amount of sub-plots he put into the series and is now desperately trying to finish the series with a good ending. I believe he will do it. It's merely a matter of 'when'."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Soon, night must fall.

If u don't believe me, read the other reviews for A Game of Thrones, and his other 2 released books. 6 in all.Wheel of Time is BORING, PERIOD.The first few books in Jordan's series are good. But he really messed himself up good with the last few and now the 10th book. OUCH!I realize that most people who are reading this complaint have most likely read the previous nine books and would like to see the series come to an end, but it looks like ur in for a long, boring, sleepy, confusing, ride. There is no end in sight. C'mon this series should have finished a long time ago and u know it also. Now we have a gazillion new characters to keep track off.Like I said before, shut off ur computer, or read some A Game of Thrones reviews just too convince urself that it is good, then shut of ur computer, go to the bookstore and buy A Game of Thrones and the other 2(A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords) if u want.

Please say yes Mr. Jordan, because I really want to continue enjoying the Wheel of Time series. But the good will that was gained up through book 7 can't last much longer.As Tolkien demonstrates, brevity and conciseness are often as valuable as attention to detail, even when creating a world and writing a series of epic scope.P.S. Am I the only person who's edition contained sentences with random words missing and paragraphs that seemed at times to have entire sentences missing? Turn the grammar check on Bob; or, better yet, get the next book to the publisher in time for an editor to give it a quick run through!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This collection could have achieved greatness and honor had the writer brought it to a satisfying end within 6-7 books.Then he could have written epilogues and appendixes to his heart's content.In fact, I wish the publishers would do just that - simply discard everything after book 5 and start over with a new # 6...editing the others as addendums.After purchasing # 7, I ceased being an avid fan, feeling &quot;mis-led and deprived&quot; of follow-up of loose ends &amp; main story line. (The same frustrations about # 10 could be applied to it).I agree that it has been therapeutic to read the current reviews / feedback from devoted followers of the WOT series... not to mention more satisfying than reading the last books.Something was amiss in book 6, and the series has continued to fall into a wilderness of writing and sub-plots.Perhaps the author enjoys the world he created so much that he just wants to travel around and visit it rather than finish the story.And lastly, it is a grave misjustice to Tolkien to even suggest relating WOT to the level of his work. I would hope literary critcs would withdraw any such statements."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Even given the ever slowing pace of the Wheel of Time books, I was staggered at the tempo to which Robert Jordan has managed to slow in this latest installment. If it wasn't for some of his stylistic hallmarks (or should I say mannerisms) I would even doubt that the first book and the tenth were written by the same man. And if the ending of book nine gave promise that the effort needed to persevere with the previous three or four books might actually be rewarded, as I progressed with book ten those hopes were quickly drowned in tears of boredom. Eventually I had to adopt a special reading style, which was more akin to scanning, in order to spare my mental faculties, but to be honest I think one could read this book upside down without missing anything of importance.It is a great shame that a story which started off so well should have come to this and I'm sorry to say that Mr Jordan has thoroughly lost the plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I blame myself for:- expecting new and refreshing ideas.- expecting something more than 1 paragraph of pertinent information for every 3 pages of irrelevant, mundane detail.- expecting the story to be somewhat cohesive rather than forever continuing in different, inconclusive, directions.- having more rewarding things to do with my time than to read this book (heck, even cutting the grass, or doing the laundry seems to require immediate attention after reading a few pages of Crossroads of Twighlight).- getting bored of the egotistic, stereotypical, unchanging characters in this book (I can only read about pompous Aes Sedai smoothing imaginary wrinkles in their clothes about a dozen times before I'm ready to toss the book out the window).- asking &quot;why?&quot; (Good grief, the battles, I understand it's a fantasy, but, things are just so ... unimpressively unbelievable. The villains are so incompetent, stupid and easily defeated, and the heroes are repeatedly described as being impressively wise, or the 'best' and 'greatest' at what they do... If the heroes are so good at what they do, why do all the same old problems continue?

I just finished it yesterday and it was so uninteresting. We really don't need to know the names of every character in the room in any particular meeting or whatever, those pages could be used for killing off some of those extraneous factions or getting more countries in line. It has become convoluted with all the side plot twists, there's so much going on that it will be difficult to tie up into everyone getting ready for tarmon gai'don, which should be a book in itself since it's supposed to be an epic battle. I'd hate for someone else to be finishing this series or for it to just be abandoned. I hope to see the next book out within a year, six months would be better. And, either get things going towards the end or start killing characters off without bringing them back so the plot can progress."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A few thousand pages ago Robert Jordan lost control of this series. It started out okay- it was absorbing (the series, I mean, not this book (which barely starts out at all)). The supposedly \\"strong\\" and \\"powerful\\" female characters have always been totally interchangeable and irritating in their petulance and their gritting of their teeth and their smoothing of their skirts. (By now there are what seems like hundreds of these women who all act the same and it is totally impossible to keep them separated thematically); but the story once moved along and things actually happened. This is at least the third book in which nothing has happened at all. That means there have been almost two thousand pages of characters not actually doing anything, just making obscure plans that are never actually verbalized. In the last three consecutive books characters are slowly and I do mean slowly moved into position for the big ACTION- the PAYOFF- but it never comes- it just goes on and on. It has always been trash and like all trash that one starts to read, one continues to read it- but this series is stagnant and going absolutely nowhere- check out Martin's Game of Thrones series- he knows how to create plot arcs that come to some kind of satisfying and even moving resolution. Jordan is wandaring in the mist of his love of verbiage and his total incapacity of create a believable female character. Buy it at a garage sale and hope for something better in the future from this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've slogged through nearly half of this book and I turned to the reviews instead (which are much more amusing and a better use of time). At the risk of repeating what *everyone* else is saying, Mr. Jordan, Can You Finish It Already?It's not just that the cast of characters has swollen to include the tiniest thread of plot; they are all the same! All the women are short tempered harpies! All the men fret about what harpies the women are!Deep breath. I truly enjoyed the first four novels in this series. I would even maybe read them again. But is it just me or is RJ trying to ride the WOT gravy train?I will not spend anymore money on this author or his series.Check out Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin.

I should have known that a book requiring a 100+ page prologue probably won't be getting to the point anytime soon.If you don't mind a few _really_ mild spoilers here's a quick summary that should let you skip the book altogether:* Is Perrin still trying to rescue Faile? Yep.* Is he significantly closer than he was at the beginning of the book? Nope.* Is Elayne still trying to secure the throne of Andor? Yep.* Is she significantly closer than she was at the beginning of the book? Nope.* Is Matt still trying to escape the Seanchan invasion of Ebou Dar? Yep.* Is he any farther away than at the beginning of the book? Not really.* Is Egwene still trying to unite the splintered White Tower? Yep.* Is she significantly closer than she was at the beginning of the book? Nope.* Does Nynaeve show up at all in the book? Not really. In one paragraph she's seen from a distance by another character but that's about it.* Is Rand doing anything at all? Nope. He's effectively neutered as a character.* Does anything interesting happen with the Black Ajah, the Dark One or the Forsaken? Not really.* Were we, the readers, subjected to endless pages describing:- the wardrobe and petty plotting of an endless stream of secondary and tertiary characters? Yep.- the catty sniping of royal pretenders and Aes Sedai? Yep.* Did _anything_ of any significance happen in this book? Not really (Oh, you could argue that some stuff happens in the last 20 pages but it really wasn't worth wading through the preceding 800 to get there).And that's pretty much it. When I think of the hours I sank into this book -- on the bus, at the doctor's office, at various meal times -- I can only shake my head that I was suckered into this series yet again. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me four times in a row (let's face it, the series has been steadily declining since A Crown of Swords) well shame on me four times over.Mr. Jordan, I officially give up. I won't be reading another of these until I hear that the series conclusion has actually been published. Since that will probably be 3-5 books down the road I don't expect to buy another until 2011. Why two stars instead of one, you might ask? I reserve 1 star for books so bad that I can't make it through to the end.

His time, your time, my time.He took two years to write about \\"events\\" that advanced the story perhaps two weeks, and the trajedy was that the \\"events\\" were such epic plot-advancers like the selection of breakfast items to be consumed, garments to be worn, which men to belittle, etc. Although, to be fair, he did throw in a passing mention of the cleansing of Saidin.BTW - you'd think Jordan would care that the majority of his readers are male, and are sick of the man-bashing. Ironically, women can also find much to be insulted at..with his depiction of the shallow, simplistic view women have of men in the WOT world.I am profoundly disappointed knowing Jordan wasted all that time writing about nothing. All that rich detail and description could have been spent on the characters...the male channels reactions to the cleansing of Saidin, the plots of Rand, the Dark One, the Chosen, anything but tea and dresses. I'd think it profoundly obvious to Jordan that we'd all like to read about something...anything that advances the plot and many subplots, instead of an expansive tome on the tiniest points of inconsequental detail. I'm sure his rationale is that he is a rich storyteller who is attempting to bring us into this rich world etc, etc, but all he seems to be doing is trying to make himself rich by stringing this thing out into 10+ books...the last four of which could have been contained in one.It's not like we didn't appreciate his rich storytelling in the first six books...just check out the glowing reviews they received. What's changed is that Jordan lost touch with what his readers loved him for, inexpicably...or intentionally.

I flew through book after book taking less than two weeks each. Then I hit book eight and it was like hitting a wall. I think it took me around a month to finish eight, nine and ten. The books didnt gradual become boring, they intantaneously became akin to watching paint dry. This might seem like exageration to someone who has not read the last few books however I assure you it is not. Jordan spent more pages describing the attire and the moods of every single character, no matter how insignificant, than on developing the story.Book eight was a major dissapointment to me, and when I finally finished it I prayed to god book nine would be better.

Every few months I find myself sifting through the Amazon.com reviews for the latter WOT books, and enjoy myself thoroughly. Kudos to you all smart people out there who certainly have more of a way with words than Mr. Jordan.I have to confess that I'm violating a principal by writing this review. I haven't read the book. In fact, I haven't read beyond Book 4, which as I gather from the reviews, was a good place to stop anyhow. I merely wanted to share my views. I don't feel bad for giving this a 1-star rating anyhow, as I'm sure if Amazon had a 0-star rating, all the ratings past book 4 would need to be significantly adjusted, and this book would have 1/2 a star instead of 1 1/2.I remember meeting Jordan in Ann Arbor for the book signing for &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;. A friend of mine had recommended me the series (back in high school, I'm getting my doctorate now, so you can see the passage of time has been ridiculous) so I thought it would be a nice gesture to get her a signed copy. Mr. Jordan waded into the room, and people applauded. When it died down, he waved for the people to continue applauding. It was perhaps a humorous gesture then, but now I cannot help but view it with disgust at his smugness, arrogance, and self-complacency.Long story short, I met my friend. I gave her the signed copy of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;. She gave me a copy of George R. R. Martin's &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. I've stopped reading Jordan, and have never looked back.Sometimes I think Jordan plans on a grand finale. Maybe all the characters will die in the end. It would end with a climatic burst of energy. Even if it were so, I don't think it justifies the last few books he's written. Nothing justifies it, not even if he ends with the best book ever written in any language.I can't wait for Jordan's next book, because the reviews he generates are awesome. :)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First, I have to say that it's well-written, with consistent characters.Unfortunately, it's well-written boredom.

The only thing that kept me turning the pages was the hope of the elusive plot twist visting me on the next page. I can't help but think that the author doesn't know what direction he would like to take with his characters. I really think that the intelligence of his readers was insulted by this thinly veiled excuse for literature.

This book CRAWLED.Although there were two or three occasions where the plot or a character were developed three-fourths of the book is describing setting due to the constant shifting from character to character. Jordan has spread himself too thin. The intricate details that once gave life to his world now choke it. His characters are spread across the world thus he is describing his world, acre by acre. Unless characters start coming together, he's going to have to either neglect some characters or leave the series unfinished he having died of old age.I like political, social and inner struggle as much as a good fight but an occurrence of any of these left me with a feeling of, 'Finally,' instead of the 'Wow,' I got form the first books of the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Absolutely horrible.

If you want to read a protracted series where events actually happen turn your attention to Janny Wurts' \\"Alliance of Light\\". Right now Robert Jordan is gouging all of us for money.

I couldn't stand reading through four pages about what the feel of the camp and the inside of a tent was. After it was already introduced!Each of the characters separate plot lines lead to nothing. No form of resolution, no answers to previous questions, and tedious new questions.Ether Robert Jordan is trying to sap every last dime out of this series, he has the worst case of writers block ever (despite almost 700 pages 0 content!), or he is senile.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNTELL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT.

I don't want to read a page devoted to describing how a person walks into a tent or what their dress looks like.

No, I'd ask him why I should even bother to continue to read this saga. maybe, Just maybe, if he took the last 200 pages of POd and the last 200 pages of WH, and nothing at all from this latest book, then maybe he would have came up with a book worthy of my money and more importantly time. The sad truth is we'll still buy the hard covers and make this clown more millions...

He seems to be more facinated with creating more players and devsing neat names than telling a tale. With the long time span between novels it requires someone with great memory power to remember all the players and all the subplots. And this book is just a review of the activitiess of the secondary characters rather than an advance in the plot line. At this time, I am reading it more for commitment to a task than for enjoyment, and if the next one is just another &quot;run in place&quot; segment, I am not sure if I will buy it. I am losing interest in the series because it is becoming too long."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"of not even coming remotely close to finishing works that seems to be continuing with others, most notably George RR Martin. Oh how I long for Writers like Stephen R Donaldson and - what was that guys name - Tol something. I've read so many pages of jordam that the good authors (or at least autors that could end a story) are becoming forgotten to me. I am insulted and disgusted by Jordan and I want the hours of my life back that the stolidus incomptus stole from me! I'm glad people are getting mad in large numbers, because I've been saying that this guy was a crook since the 4th book. And, I got one through five all at the same time as a gift, so I read them in a short period of time. Guess what!? he cuts and pasted descriptions! I swear it's true. Someone who is REALLY mad should look through his previous books and prove what a con man Jordan is. By the way, people should post some good alternate reads here from authors who have ethics as concerns their readers.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The ratings are fair for this insulting book. I will only criticize the most appalling of the flaws. To create anticipation for the next book in the series, Jordan completely changes the personality of a key character. The particular character had always been portrayed as cautious, wise and intelligent. Jordan changes this character to being stupid, careless and impetuous. This is hack writing at a level worse than the pap you see on TV! I have been able to forgive the flaws in the other books in the series because Jordan had given me enough in each book for me to keep reading. Completely changing the established personality of a key character just to advance a sub-plot and create interest for the next in the series is unforgivable! Do not start the Wheel of Time series and, definitely, quit before you read this book!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must give this last attempt at continuing this epic tale a very low rating.The book drags on for over 800 pages and fails to tie up of the long threads of this very twisted plot and just goes on to add to more of the \`pseudo mysteries' that plague this series.The descriptions of attire and scenery have become all too trite and contribute very little to furthering the main plot of the story.Disappointing and SLOW is all I can think to say of this episode of a saga I am beginning to get very tired of."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"WoT, at this point reminds me of a puzzle from the Infocom text adventure Beyond Zork. At one point, the player character finds him/herself on a bridge. With every step across the bridge, the character moves at a decreasing rate, finding himself 1/2, 3/4ths, 7/8ths, 15/16ths, 35/36ths... of the way across the bridge but can never cross because he moves forward less and less with each move. The only escape is to leap from the bridge. With WoT, each book advances the plot less and less (this book actually moves backwards, starting with a different perspective on events before the conclusion of the last book - yikes). At this point, Book 12 will cover 1 day from the perspective of 100 characters and will consist entirely of braid pulling, sniffing, arm folding, descriptions of baths, etc... The only escape is to make a complete break from the series altogether (I know I'll never bother with it again) - the equivalent of Beyond Zork's bridge jump."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This was by far the worst book in the series to date. It felt like all of the characters were simply treading water and nothing new was happening. Not enough Mat, Perrin and Rand to satisfy me. Rand got a chapter and change; unacceptable. While reading this book i felt like Jordan was just trying make as much money as he could off the series by putting out a book where nothing really happened. I am also very tired of the whole women against men theme. Very weird/useless/annoying to have to read.

It doesn't go anywhere! How often do we need to hear about dresses being straightened, sisters with bad attitudes and ageless faces?? All this was setup books ago in this plodding series. I admit that I am hooked. Maybe just a hopeless optimist. But the book should resolve something, but never does. No bad guys killed or love interests brought together, or battles fought. Can't we just at least get rid of Elaida? Or maybe save Faile? Frustration is the word that describes this book. Now I hear there is a Prequel out! Why waste time on that when the main story isn't close to being done?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"All I can say is, \\"...!?\\" I read the book, but I couldn't give you a freakin' summary because I am not entirely sure anything actually HAPPENED. RJ's talents have gone from writing wonderful fantasy novels to being able to cover 600 pages with words and yet still convey absolutely nothing. The first five books are positively brilliant; then it slows down a bit in the next four, and then... you have the tenth one. I wouldn't call it a book. Waste of paper, maybe. Or something to bludgeon Mr. Jordan with. Possibly some good fire fuel...As you may recall, Mr. Jordan's bio seems to include something about he intends to keep writing until they nail shut his coffin... Well, we (the angry readers) might as well nail it shut now, because if the rest of his books are like this then he may as well not be writing any more. Wait a damn minute... did I just call it writing? HA! And I refuse to be sparing with my insults, because I think RJ insulted his readers as a whole by wasting our time with a 600+ page book whose plot (PWP?) makes a snail look like Speedy Gonzalez.And then... there's New Spring. I haven't read it, so it might be good... and it is nice to see the history behind some characters, but... THAT IS SOME SERIOUS PROCRASTINATING! You better get writing the eleventh, RJ, and make it snappy! The plot had better be as fast-paced and action-packed as the first three, or I will skewer you with a skewer from skewer-space! It is going to take him a long time to recover from this, because he's lost a ton of readers from this mess-up... not to mention he lost plenty from the last, slower-paced books. I'll still keep reading, at least until I find that I've read 3 plotless \\"books\\" in a row, at which point even an avid fan like me will gleefully torch the \\"books\\". If this was some stunt to make more money, well... Mr. Jordan, you will not have any more bestsellers, EVER if you keep this up... ..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I get so angry reading some of these reviews, because it shows me how easily a man&iexcl;s career can be destroyed by a bunch of illiterate [fools.]You say this is a horrible book because Jordan goes into too much laborious and repetitive detail and characterization, not enough attention is given to the &iexcl;main characters&iexcl;, and there&iexcl;s not much action. Nearly 700 whining, sniveling reviews, and that&iexcl;s all you can come up with to justify your opinions. I have read the majority of the reviews here, and if anyone should be embarrassed by the amount of laborious repetition in their writing, it is you people. The few truly intelligent and insightful reviews given are all positive (one intelligent person in particular, thanks &iexcl;hawkedup&iexcl;). So many people complain that there is little attention given to Rand as the &iexcl;main character&iexcl;. What on earth gave you the idea that he is the &iexcl;main character&iexcl; in the first place? Just because he&iexcl;s the Dragon Reborn doesn&iexcl;t mean the whole story has to revolve around him. This saga is about the people AROUND Rand, and how their world is affected. Rand is a great guy, but there are SO many other characters in these books that are infinitely more interesting and malleable. As for the introduction of new characters who never return and the time spent on &iexcl;marginal&iexcl; characters, someone mentioned in their review the chapter told through Alviarin&iexcl;s point of view. I am relieved that at least one of you understands Jordan&iexcl;s style enough to realize that he is not actually developing new characters as much as he is using the point of view of those characters to reveal integral material, such as the inner workings of the White Tower. I find this to be a fascinating approach to storytelling on Jordan&iexcl;s part. (By the way, for those of you who say Jordan never draws any of his subplots to a close, did you forget completely about the struggle between Alviarin and Elaida for control within the Tower? I&iexcl;d say that one was pretty much decided when Alviarin was deposed as Keeper.) As for the &iexcl;excessive&iexcl; use of detail&iexcl;K.how can you read these works and not appreciate every detail you&iexcl;re given as one more way to immerse yourself in the story and allow yourself to truly know and understand the characters, to become them and see what they see, feel what they feel? If Perrin is standing in the snow berating himself because he hasn&iexcl;t been able to rescue his wife, I want to know how cold that snow is, because it brings me closer to what Perrin is experiencing. Now for my final point: the lack of action. I admit that &iexcl;Crossroads of Twilight&iexcl; was under par in this respect, but come on, people! It&iexcl;s called delayed gratification! It&iexcl;s been Jordan&iexcl;s M.O. in every book, so what exactly were you expecting? It is very unfair and rather immature for us to impose the worn-out old model of the &iexcl;fantasy novel&iexcl; to Jordan&iexcl;s work, when he&iexcl;s the first one to break free of those strictures and attempt some genuine originality. If you want the predictable tension/climax/resolution formula, I suggest you stick to more sophomoric authors such as Terry Brooks. For those of you who found Crossroads of Twilight frustrating but are mature enough to remain loyal to &iexcl;The Wheel of Time&iexcl;, try to see the big picture! Perhaps the suggestion of waiting until the final book is published, then reading them all together would work better for you. And for those of you who think Jordan&iexcl;s convoluted plot is out of control because you can&iexcl;t keep up with it&iexcl;KGod help you, because you&iexcl;re just too dumb to be reading such sophisticated material. Get over it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is an excellent book in a great series. It is in fact the only fantasy series I read. The rest of the fantasy genre is pretty pathetic.There are a few boring parts in books 1-6 but the series takes off with \\"A Crown of Swords\\" which is probably the best book in the series. Crossroads of Twilight is probably about the 2nd or 3rd best book in the series.The tired argument that \\"nothing happens\\" is simply not true. It is impossible for nothing to happen. If you want non-stop brainless action, yes it is lacking in that - but I consider that one of this books strong points. I really like the direction the series has taken. Instead of the same old trolloc battles, again and again, the series has shifted to more of a social interaction focus. I prefer to hear conversations between characters and their strategies than to just read about them swinging weapons around.*Dyslexia is a problem with reading comprehension. For those reviewers that claim they couldn't remember anything that happened after reading the book I would urge you to seek help from a psychologist. Dyslexia can be overcome as long as there is no damage to the nervous system."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was, without a doubt, the best in the series so far. My advice to anyone who doesn't like the series is to stop reading and make everyone happy. It would seem that many of the current generation of readers lack the attention span to actually enjoy anything longer than 10-15 pages. This is very sad because they are missing out on a great many things simply because of their lack of patience. Robert Jordan is telling his story in the way that he chooses. Enjoy it while you can because he will probably move on to a different story when this one is done and leave the World of the Wheel behind forever."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This whole series is absolutely fantastic, and this book was no exception......Some people reviewing this book may be ignorant...I just do not know!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think that the 10th book was very well done. I noticed in a lot of the reviews that people were not happy because there weren't any big events or what not. This book was based on subplots, as another reviewer noted. If you stop and think about each little subplot you'll notice that they blend together perfectly. Some of the subplots relate so well that if you take a step back to examine them, you can't help but to admire the complexity of it all and the foresight that R.J. has."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan did it again. He wrote a wonderfull book.Crossroads of Twilight is fantastic!!!!We see a lot of interesting developments and there where a lot of surprises for me.Jordan Rulez!!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There are a few flaws in the reviews you each have given. First I would like to address is that in book 9, the cleansing of saidin took but a chapter. In book 10 it was occuring for half of the book. Also there is political progression with the Aes Sedai and with Elayne in Caemelyn. Jordon was prized in the first books for being an atypical fantasy author that didn't focus only on action. Concerning the politics the Succesion of a queen takes time, even in a fantasy world and Elayne has made progress. Egwene and other Aes Sedai are concluding the worst from the hole where Shadar Logath used to be. Proposed from this was an alliance of Aes Sedai and Asha'man, this is huge.The claims that Rand has been inactive in books 8,9 and 10 may seem true from readers who are not careful about how careful they read. In book 9 he did something so amazing, it's enough of Rand for 3 books. Realize that channeling anything can strain someone, channeling enough saidin and saidar to destroy the entire world is enough to kill any one, even the Dragon Reborn with exaustion. Also Rand isn't the only hero. This has been clear from the beginging. Mat is just as crucial as Rand because he is needed to blow the Horn of Valere at Tarmon Gai'don. Perrin is also key. His ability with wolves is needed at the Last Battle as well. I don't know about all of you, but I don't want to be reading to have Mat and Perrin just pop up at the last battle without any development. A writer who does that is horrible.It may seem like Mat and Perrin are doing nothing, but this is not the case. Perrin is preparing an offensive against the Shaido with the aid of the Sheanchan. Mat is running from Sheanchan while trying to figure out how to fulfill his destiny. And Rand did a major event as well. He proposed an alliance of some sort with the Seanchan. Aes Sedai outside of Tar Valon are preparing an offensive against those inside.When it comes down to it, this book is a book of preperation with everything lying on the edge of bursting in action. Every book brings us closer to Tarmon Gai'don. Each with more conflicts as many physical as not. This may be a fantasy world, but Jordan doesn't see this as a fantasy world, this is his world. It operates with the realism of the real world with fantasy twist. Everyone seems confused why Jordan is still getting stunning proffesional reviews and this is why. He hasn't created a fantasy world but a world that is real. Of all fantasy books I've read they have all have the same flaw except Jordan's and Tolkien's, this flaw is unrealism. People constantly compare Jordan to Tolkien and this is the reason why.Jordan, being physicist by proffesion is quite well educated, and that is his audience, the educated. If you are an adult who refused to read at all in high school except for assignments, then this probably isn't for you. If the movies you typically watch could be shown to an audience that speaks five languages and they all understand it because of the amount of action, then this book probably isn't for you. If all you're interested in reading is fiction, this might not be for you. This is a sophisticated book for sophisticated minds. Frankly, if you aren't well educated, or sophisticated in nature, then don't get this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan is not for everyone. If you're a huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan and love everything with his name on it, you might like the first four or even five. Six through ten you won't like. Same with Resident Evil or even Van Helsing (all of them made well any enjoyable but are in no way thoughtful or thinking entertainment). However, if you are a thoughtful and intelligent reader who enjoys the classics, who puts detail and character development and plausible, original world building on equal footing with story and suspense, you'll like it. You won't claim nothing is happening because there is no violence and bloodshed. You will be intelligent enough to recognize that there are six or seven story lines (books seven through ten) and that the story cannot always move very fast. The story has to develop fully or the effect will be lost, especially with tWoT because you'll never read more complicated fiction than this. Everything must line up for the end and everyone is on the verge of making tough decisions that have inconceivable (at least to them) advantages or repercussions (hence CROSSROADS of Twilight). There are many undercurrents that most people don't seem to understand; it boggles my mind.Another misconception: The only parallel between The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings is the quest which does not include any magical article in need of destruction.Moraine does not resemble Gandalf in any way. She is a lot like Merlin, though.And no, even more ridiculous, Rand does not resemble Frodo. He resembles King Arthur. He bears the slightest resemblance to the Anti-Christ of Revelation. He bears the slightest resemblance to Jesus Christ.Lan, though you see only a little him, has as much in common with Conan. Yes, he is a king, but he is a king of kingdom that no longer exists. Unlike Aragorn and more like Conan, he's very much muscle-bound. Needless to say all of them have different personalities.The Ogier slightly resemble the Ents but in nothing more than complaints concerning hastiness.Both Tolkien and Jordan borrow from Norse mythology but Tolkien's use of it is more common throughout and he manipulated it less for his story than did Jordan. No, The Wheel of Time resembles the story of King Arthur much more with a lot of St. John's Revelation of Jesus Christ, touches of Hindu mythology and a little bit of physics. His cultures also are unique to one degree or another, especially the Aiel.Another comparison I have found amazing of late is the claim that Jordan is trying to write like Martin. I am a fan of both authors and can say without doubt that there is no resemblance. While they are both equally entertaining their styles are different and their methods for telling the story are different. Jordan books are written one to two Flesch-Kincaid grade levels higher, which means that Jordan's books are written for a more intellectual audience. (You can compare the two easily. Both Jordan and Martin have free chapter downloads on their websites which you can download. Copy it to Microsoft Word and complete a brief spell-check. If you at least have Windows ME it will give the grade level at the end.)Also, Jordan books are an apocalyptic tale of good vs. evil in which the good characters generally have set moral values which makes the books more relevant. Martin tells the story of a war between kingdoms over a throne. His characters are generally relativists, meaning no absolutes, meaning that they will do what they need to do to get what they want even if it's wrong, basically Machiavellian in principal. Again, not always true but usually.There are also those who claim his female characters aren't realistic. These people are all men; I've yet to find a review by a woman claiming the female characters were not realistic. I've read of a few that thought he was a woman with a man's pen name until they met him at a book signing. I have talked to enough females who have read the series who confirm his female characters are accurate. In fact, I have only heard one negative comment from one female reader and she felt that, though they acted like real women, their personalities were negative.Another complaint is that . . . I don't know how else to say it . . . that the characters are consistent. That's funny. It seems some people don't want there characters to be consistent. It does not matter if they are annoying or not. I've known some annoying people in my day. Generally they are consistent. So what? It's difficult to be patient with them. The understanding, thoughtful reader will understand this element of realism. Nynaeve is always yanking on her braid. So what some of the characters never learn from their mistakes? By some of these reviews I get the impression that many of you feel you made a mistake buying book seven. And book eight. And book nine. And book ten. And the prequel. Sound familiar?By the way, after a man writes a story for seventeen years, he's going to need a break. So what if he takes a break and writes a prequal. I have not read any one star reviews for Stephen King's The Dark Tower series just because there were years between each of the first five Dark Tower books. Look at how many books he wrote between each one of those and how many years it took him. Eight years for book two, three years for book three, almost five years for book four, six years for book five.Nevertheless, I'm certain that when this story is concluded, most of the people that criticized 7-10 will understand the books much more and wish to take their negative reviews back despite their denial.Another rumor is that Jordan says the series will go to thirteen books. He still says twelve. He also says that the final volume will be very long and he will fight to keep it one volume. Whether he realizes after fifteen hundred pages (Lord of Chaos and a half) that he won't be able to do it or if he is actually capable of finishing the series in just one book without ruining everything, that is something else. One thing is for sure; most of you, when the series is finished, might sigh with relief but, after a few years, you'll be very disappointed it wasn't longer.Oh, and you can be sure that, when writing the truth, the negative reviews and slanders normally materialize quickly. Gives me a certain smile and level of satisfaction I get from nowhere else. It's a little humorous, too, especially when a desperate reviewer claims that a certain veracious reader cannot know the classics even if the classics make up most of that his reading which ranges, varying anywhere from scientific journals and history to science fiction and horror (adds up to some three hundred authors). I'll continue to sit back and watch the negative reviews roll in.I change for no man, even if the rest of the world was against me. I only reinforce my statements because my suppositions are generally proven correct by the end.Continuing to observe ignorance as it oozes in like raw sewage."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Good, hard to read the tiny print.

Imagine, dedicating over a decade of your life creating and enriching a world and characters which you have created. Now, envision having to stop writing about them, except perhaps occasional short stories for your own pleasure, forever. Do you think Jordan could honestly take up his pen and write a fast moving, stuning conclusion to the series? he would lose a part of his life, and the majority of REAL fans would be disappointed. Those who claim to be fans, after a short period of time, would merely shift their criticism from the slowness of the books to the disappointing and hastily written ending.the book itself i found very enjoyable. True, i did not race through the pages as i was prone to do with earlier novels, but it kept me captivated, and i found myself thinking about it for quite a while after i finished.My only complaint is its length. For a time, Jordan's books have been getting progressively shorter; i would love to see a 58 chapter book of The Shadow Rising calibur.Thee fact that i desired it to be longer, however, almost defeats its purpose in criticizing the book when you take into account that this signifies that the book was very enjoyable and i would have liked to enjoy myself for a while longer.I think that those of you who so harshly criticize this book have forgotten the thirst you must have once felt for more WOT books, and if there are less positive reviews of this book, it is merely because those who truly appreciate WOT dismiss this ignorant criticism with a chuckle.If you are wavering between deciding whether or not to buy this book, BUY IT! please ignore the other harsh reviews and know that i speak from my heart when i say that this book upholds the glorious tradition started by the Eye of the World."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is the best written book in the series. I think the first three books were good enough to keep you reading but the series didn't really take off until The Shadow Rising. So if you start this series don't give up! It only gets better as you go along. I actually enjoyed the parts about Elayne in this installment, contrary to most reviewers. I also really don't understand the complaints about how much time lapses in this book. What does that have to do with how good a book is? Isn't there some popular TV show \\"24\\" that only spans 24 hours over all 24 episodes? I could care less if a book spans 3 hours or 3 months, as long as it's written well. To me the writing in this book is the best Robert Jordan has ever done. His prose has reached its peak; very clear and lucid. The characters are the genius behind why this series is so good. I don't want to just read a laundry list of \\"major events\\" which is what every reviewer seems to be crying for. I want to read what the characters are thinking and experiencing, what they do on an everyday level. Robert Jordan, in this installment, has made reading about Perrin standing in the woods eating a bucket of chicken more interesting than the stale old 'Rand fights another forsaken' stuff. This is the best series in fantasy and Crossroads of Twilight deserves the title of best novel ever written in the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Everybody seems to be bashing this book. No one seems to think that anything important happened in Crossroads of Twilight. On the contrary, eveything that happens in this novel is absolutely integral to the story. With Crossroads of Twilight Jordan sets up the final part of this long series. The first 3/4 of the book essentialy brings the reader up to speed on the current whereabouts and situations of the main characters, and is quite good. The last part of the book is fantastic. It sets the stage for the consolidation of the peoples of Jordan's world, and the events leading up to the Last Battle, although it ends on quite a cliffhanger leaving the reader with a craving for more. This is definitely the caliber of book I expect from Robert Jordan. I strongly recommend this book to any who have followed this series, and I anxiously await the next installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you don't like the way Robert Jordan writes, stop reading his books!

Did you notice, reading number 10, that book 9 lasted 22 days?? that's right--22 days! And that's just the way it is, folks. I enjoy the way RJ writes and I loved Crossroads of Twilight. I can't wait for book 11. I will be disappointed when the series ends, and I hope he makes it last another 2 or 3 at least.I highly recommend this book.

If he sucks soo bad, then why will I find the same damn people complaining about book eleven when it comes out! Give it a break!You all say the last four books have been boring (what other author has readers complaing about the last FOUR books - think about that, people usually stop at one.) Well, I can think of another author who was thought of as boring, long winded, and over descriptive in his narration. His name was JRR Tolkien. What made him popular in the generations after was the rich and complex world he created. Ever read the Silmarilian? You'll think RJ's books are plenty exciting after that.In anycase, if RJ's books aren't exciting enough, stop reading them. Go read romance novels or something.

Just because Rand does not kill one of the forsaken does not mean that the Crossroad of Twilight is not a fabulous book. In my opinion the Wheel of Time series, much in the same manner as the Lord of the Rings movies, is beyond criticicm. Yes, if this were a singular book, or the first book in a series, it would fall flat on its face. But it is not, it is the TENTH book in a series that has always been about detail and intrigue. For those of you that have criticized this book for exactly these reasons, you never were a Robert Jordan fan; go back to reading the Shanara series and leave The Wheel of Time in peace. This book is amazing, and exactly what I was expecting. Shia'Tan is gaining more control over the world, the last battle is coming. The characters need to be in place so that it can happen, and if Robert Jordan needed to take most of a book to do so, that is his right. If you think differently, go and write your own fantasy epic..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A recent positive review compared this series to a chess match, moving all the pieces in place.What a load of tripe! This would have to be the slowest, longest, poorest played chess match in history.If you like endless description of what the characters are wearing, with little if any plot advancement, then this book is for you. Or if you want to read pages detailing the washing of silk (Who on earth reading a novel wants this?), read on brave reader. Perhaps an aid to sleep is what this book really should be marketed as.If you want to read great fantasy (as opposed to poor) read George RR Martin. There's honestly no comparison. Martin's work, as opposed to this mess, is focused, dramatic, exciting, has evolving characters, and is fun to read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Thank you fellow reviewers for helping me work through my rage, disillusionment and frustration at being hoodwinked by this author yet again. Sometimes it's helpful just to know that there are other people out there who feel the same way you do.It's not just anger at myself for buying the book when I ought to have known, from the decline of the last few books, that it might be a disappointment. It is also anger at Robert Jordan for destroying a series that I loved so much. I so desperately wanted it to succeed! I was on RJ's side, willing to put up with his failures, hoping that he would pull through in the end. Now I realise that Robert Jordan is not my friend. He does not care at all for his audience, any more than he cares for the characters in his series. He has betrayed those of us who persevered with his series in the face of ridicule from our friends who gave up on him long ago.Like a junkie, though, I will feel an urge to take a peak at his future books when they come out, if the Amazon.Com reviews are positive. I still do care for the characters and their destinies. However I will win back some of my self-respect by getting the books from the library so as to deny RJ some revenue and thus retrieve some of the money he should never have been paid for Crossroads of Twilight."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"He's either senile or dead. No creater would allow a good series like this one go to hell-in-a-handbasket. I figure his kids are churning out the books while he rots or drools on himself. This cash-cow has long since dried up. I could write better than this and I stink on ice."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was curious to see where Jordan was in his unending output of empty blab. You see: I stopped at Path of Daggers, book 8. Then my wife found Winter's Heart abandoned at an airport gate (surprised somebody would just dump it?), so I read it. That was 2 years ago, I think. Since then I'm cured. I am not giving any of my money to such dishonest enterprises.But once in a while I get bored and roam the internet visiting old flames. In this case, woe be, I looked into the Wheel of Time. Mr. Jordan is still at it and not only adding paper to his unending rambling, but also publishing a prequel. Who would read a prequel on an unfinished series? The man is as greedy as they come! The quality of his/her writing (I honestly think a teenager wrote the last few books)was lost right at the fourth book of the oodleology and he ran out of a likely story line right about the sixth book.See here, I am an avid reader. And I don't discriminate based on age, genre or religious point of view. And in all honesty I don't expect much from fantasy fiction. Only some escapist entertainment. I don't expect to find Tolkiens at every corner, either. But the pits is the pits and Mr. Jordan loves the abode as long as there is a nickel coming his way. At this point I believe he is merely milking the few diehard fans who are left out there. And here is what I don't understand. People still support such a racket, even if it's by buying paperbacks, even if it's by checking his books out of the library. If another of his books comes my way, I promise you it will end up in the next bonfire in the same condition it came: unread.Another thing that irks me is the new cover jackets proclaiming he continues the work of Tolkien. Talk about an inflated ego! But enough.Mr. Jordan: I just read a few of the Shannara trilogies and I have some advice for you: follow Terry Brooks' example of excellent, honest authorship. When Mr. Brooks thinks all is said he just writes \\"THE END\\" and goes on to a new story. When Mr. Brooks starts writing a book he already knows when to finish it. He doesn't go on and on with shallow prattle only to fill the 600 pages or so of a bad book.That is all I have to say. And this note is for those of you who may be outraged by my critizism of Mr. Jordan and his Wheel of eternal boredom: do not bother writing responses. I won't visit this site again in a good while. And think of this: you have the power to kick out this habit. This habit leads you nowhere, because this series will never, never end, as long as you keep buying the books. Be strong. Be your own person. Just say NO."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...that I love to read.

I bought the hardcover as soon as it came out, not wanting to wait...yea, never doing that again.I got to the start of Egweene's part and stopped.

I can't really remember now. I see that Jordan has a new book out--and that he plans to write two more prequels to an, as yet, unfinished tale.Of course Jordan really meant to say that there would be five prequels or maybe six or seven and maybe after the prequels are done he'll write some \\"in-between-quels\\" that cover the time between The Wheel of Time and The Great Hunt (good for at least four books) or TGH and The Shadow Rising (another two or three) or....I'm begining to think he's like that lady in California who kept adding rooms to a house, thinking it would prolong her life. Only Jordan thinks he'll die when he writes the last book in the WoT series.I don't know--but I am cured. No more books for me, not even if he finishes the series. He'd have to hire another writer to go through and edit this train-wreck of a fantasy series into--oh five or six books before I'd look at it again.Or maybe some Noble Soul (tm) on the Internet will perform a Phantom Edit (tm) on the work--producing a readable text for the rest of us--not that I'm encouraging any sort of Copyright violation!It does suck, because the first few books might not have been Tolkien, but they certainly entertained.As suggested above, the appropriate comparison is not to Tolkien but to George Lucas. The original Star Wars trilogy was good-to-great (well before George abused it by having Greedo shoot first in the SE)--maybe even genius at times. The first two of the current trilogy have you wondering how the same man who produced the Empire Strikes Back could now produce such dreck.The answer of course is the same--in both the first Trilogy (less-so for RotJ) and the early WoT novels--George and Robert had outside controls (Fox producers/Tor editors) to protect themsevles (and us) from their own baser instincts. Now due to the massive commercial success of their product, they no longer have to answer to anyone and no-one they work with provides any of the necessary criticisms of their work (there is the story circulating on the net of an ILM animator working on Episode I who tried to tell George what a bad idea Jar-Jar was, who was fired for his efforts--I do not know if it is true, but it certainly rings true).Of course the comparison breaks down slightly because George, at least, has the deceny to limit himself to using up only a few hours of our time--with Jordan the pain lingers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yes, that's right, folks!

That's too high for trash like this. It hurts me a little to make that comment, being an avid WOT fan and all, but it's the brutal truth. By now whoever's reading this has probably heard about the flaws of this book so I won't go into great detail on the matter. Instead I'll just give a short summary of the problems: 1 dimensional characters, stalled plot, uninteresting scenario's and an overall sense of bordom are what make this book so terrible. Literally nothing happens. I don't care to speculate on why Robert Jordan's works have declined so much in quality over the past few years, it's really not important. The fact is once he was a great writer, now he's not.

It happens to even the best, but please don't ask us all to hang on with you, throwing our hard-earned money at your failures.I will not read the next installment unless the reviews indicate a significant turn-around. If the other posters on this website -- the ones who accurately reviewed \\"Crossroads\\" as a giant turd -- consider the next book worth reading, I'll give it a try, knowing that the voice of the people was heard by this arrogant and self-indulgent author. If, on the other hand, it's more of the same braid-pulling, silk-wearing, dress-smoothing ramble, I'll cut my losses and Jordan won't get any more of my money.

It is Perrin in a very dark time, and it is forcing Perrin to get over himself and take command.This book FINALY develops the Mat/Daughter of the Nine Moons issue that has been promised sense book 4 (this is book 10). It's a lot of fun as they both try to figure each other out.There are a LOT of plot lines flowing at the same time, which means he has a choice to make: he can either show one set of plot lines during the time period, followed by another book showing the same time period for the other plot lines; or he could just wright as per normal and publish two books with the plot development of one book. Robert Jordan did the latter. If you read 10 and 11, one after another, it doesn't seem slow. Unfortunately, most people had to wait about two and a half years between the two, which made it feel even slower then it was."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was truly a waste of time..

It seems that the entire purpose of this book was to put the characters in position for what would happen in the next book. Nothing else. Nada. And to achieve this took hundreds of pages. Now I love the fact that the series is going on and on - really I do! If Mr. Jordan hadn't passed away I'd gladly have read this series for another 10 years without a grumble. But this book ... well, its basically useless and if you read everything else in the set skipping over this book you would hardly miss it.

So why read it at all you ask? I do like the story, but the books are getting monotinous in the telling. I picked up The Eye of the World in 2005 out of curiousity (since I love fantasy) and got hooked on the story. I began reading the books in sequence and am about to finish Crossroads of Twilight shortly. I honestly feel that if Mr Jordan had ended the series two books ago he would have done a justice not only to his fan base but also to the story. The beginning of the last three books have been very well done, capturing the readers interest and drawing them into the plot of the book. Unfortunatly the story takes a turn for the mundane about chapter five or so in each book and doesn't pick back up until the last four or five chapters. Everything inbetween is pretty useless and could be edited down into a few chapters that keep the reader on edge and interested instead of a lot of empty filler about who is doing what and wearing which dress with what hair piece and so on and so on. Also the inner thoughts of who has the hots for who and what it makes them feel is pretty far from the original premise I found in the first three books. I guess to sum it up, this is a good book if you can muddle through the middle and concentrate on the beginning and the end. I have about three or four chapterts to go and the story is picking up as I expected. I expect the next two books (the story is supposed to end with book 12 I hear) will read much the same.

For cryin' out loud, he takes over half the book to even catch up to the end of the 9th (filling us in on the couple of days we missed what other characters have been doing... like taking a bath).I felt this series started to go downhill with book 5, when he started leaving out some of the secondary characters for a book, to create more and more characters that don't move the plot forward at all.So why'd I give it 2 whole stars. He still takes three lines to say what could be said just as well in one, but he does paint a scene well.However, even his attention to detail gets anoying. He can be in the middle of a battle, and digres off to someone's lapels, or what they were doing three years ago, or ...

This book keeps you up to date on a daunting number of those details in the many widely separated venues he has created, spending several long chapters on each one. He does not resolve or significantly progress any of the plot lines, with the possible exception of developments with Tuon and a (truly) last-minute plot twist.

Anyone looking for substantial plot advancement in the 10th installment of the Wheel of Time can just forget it with this book. While Jordan may have set up his next book(s) with several cliffhanger decisions made by his characters, nothing happened in this book that he could not have covered in 1/10 the pages. I cannot express my disappointment in finishing the book so quickly, only to look back and ask &quot;Did anything happen?&quot; in the book. (The answer is &quot;no&quot;). If this is to be the pace Jordan is going to use to finish the storyline, it may never get done. Rand hardly appears in the book, Mat's and Perrin's storylines move at a glacial pace (with no resolution) and the same is true for Elayne and Egwene. On the other hand, Jordan seems to delight in the introduction of new extremely minor characters and spends an inordinate amount of time describing them. I agree with other reviewers who complain that the influx of these new &quot;characters&quot; make the book very difficult to follow. This book appears to be an example of a publisher allowing an author to write a book merely to make some money while not saying anything. I don't want to reveal the few plot advances that did occur, but suffice it to say, there weren't many. Anyone wishing to read this book should get it at the library or, at least wait until it comes out in paperback. Paying for the hardcover is not worth the money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is obvious that Robert Jordan doesn't have any passion for this series any more.

The plot is not advanced an iota. Nada. After the semi-cliffhanger of book nine (Rand unconcious, source clean, maybe, etc) I was really hoping for something to happen, some questions to be answered, some plot/character development. I was sorely dissapointed. Really, I think this book has put me off the series entirely. After books 7, 8, and this one, there just doesn't seem any point. At this rate, we might see the end of the series by the year 3000. Is Jordan getting paid per word?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The truth about this book; you have a 600 page book that has about 200 pages of dialogue and 400 pages of superfluous description. Jordan really has lost control of his plot and his editors should know better than to let him get away with publishing this tripe. There is no character development, almost no plot development, no real storyline. The reader is introduced to a maelstrom of confusion and disjointed thoughts of the author. The simple fact is that this book could have been shorted by two-thirds and then rewritten to actually go somewhere, heck anywhere. Save yourself some money ignore this book and skip to the next one. Maybe someone will put Jordan over their knee and knock some sense into him. I've been reading Jordan since the late 80's when I was in high school. As of this book he has officially lost a fan.

After much plodding through a world of redundancy, he does manage to close with a few cliffhangers, a couple of which were well done and (should) promise some exciting events in Book 11. I'll be eagerly awaiting what happens next to Mat and Egwene!But unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this installment. Perrin's plotline is the most frustrating, because unless Faile has some special deal with the Creator, why the hell are we forced to chase her for 3 books?! Not much happens with Rand, though we know what's coming so not too many worries there. Elayne hasn't really progressed either - what a boring few chapters with her! Also, there's not a lot from the Forsaken. So yes, once again we've been blessed with another filler in this series. I really hope (yeah, I've been saying this for three books now) that Book 11 picks up the pace and gets us much closer to the dynamic finish that so many of us have been waiting for.Oh, and Mr. Jordan! Please hold off on the \\"New Spring\\" rewrite until after The Last Battle.

How can absolutely nothing happen in close to 700 pages? The only explanation I can come up with is that Jordan is trying to stretch this series out for another 10 books. Well he has successfully killed this series for me. I won't be reading anymore and I would strongly suggest not reading Crossroads. It's a complete waste of time. It was downright boring throughout. Usually Jordan at least finishes the book with some excitement. Not this time. Boring, Boring and even more Boring."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well Robert Jordan has managed to resurrect the writing style evidenced in the first 6 books of the series which was sorely lacking in books 7-9. However, in nearly 700 pages, virtually no questions from the previous book were answered. In addition, very little action occurred: Elayne still does not have the throne, Mat is not married, Egwene was not taken/unified the White Tower, Perrin still has not rescued Faile and Rand does not seem to be one step closer to the final battle.Robert Jordan... if you or your publisher read these reviews, I think many of your fans, like myself who are teetering on the edge of never buying another one of your books out of sheer frustration and disappointment, deserves a public explanation. I'd like to know what you have up your sleeve for the series and when we can expect it to end.I'd like to draw your attention to the multitude of authors that have completed series in four books and less. Many others have set the bar yet you seem to fall short at over 6,000 pages published with no end in sight. Will we be left waiting another three years for you to bring this series to a close? If so, I don't have the patience for it.Even if you are an avid reader of the series, I think you should wait for the paperback and seriously give consideration to abandoning the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's plain and simple. Jordan is just too lazy to take the time to write a good ending to the series. He's also a huge sell-out and a GREEDY B (I mean, come on, who else charges for a prologue?). We are, however, somewhat attached to his characters.Easy solution: Borrow the book from you public library. You get to read the story; he doesn't get any money. So what if you have to wait a week or two for your library to get a copy. It's not like you haven't waited years for the series to do something .At one point, Jordan was thought of as Tolken's equal. Let's see how well his money consoles him when he realizes he gave up a place in Literary history for a few bucks that he'll waste before he comes back trying to sell us some more trash."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I Give Up!It saddens me, but I cannot stomach reading anymore of these books. I sincerely loved the first 6 books; they were wonderful. Book 7 was a little weak, and I suspected the story was intentionally \\"drug out\\" a bit, but it was still pretty good so I let it slide. Book 8 was worse, much worse. On finishing the book, I felt that nothing really much had happened. Book 9 seemed a little better mainly because something happened at the end of the book, and I hoped against hope that things had finally turned the corner for the better.This book is by far the worst in the series. It is absolutely the most boring book I have read. I'll concede that I've read some that were worse, but not more boring unless you consider badly written math or history textbooks. Many people have already said the same things I'm about to say, but here goes.One-half of the book (at least) consists of either long descriptions of clothes and chairs and clothes etc... or boring/trivial conversations where very little if anything interesting and useful actually occurs. CoT, even more than PoD, seems like only part of a book with a lot of worthless extra filler added for bulk. I actually stopped every 2 or 3 chapters and thought out loud \\"Is anything going to happen?\\" Well, no nothing much really does happen.The book begins with one of the main characters, basically where they were the last book (if not the last 2 or 3 books), until it appears like something might actually happen at which time Jordan switches to another character (repeating the process) and so on and so on. The only truly interesting part of the book is the end because of the cliffhangers that Jordan writes to sucker us into buying the next installment.Most books have some level of conflict/rising action/climax/resolution etc, but this one doesn't. Maybe the scene depicted on the cover is supposed to be a climax, but it falls way short, especially for a book of close to 700 pages. Reading should be a joy, but I found this book a struggle with my driving motivation being hope that things will improve and that the story would move forward again. Well, my hope has been betrayed, and I no longer have any faith in Mr. Jordan so I'm done wasting my time and money on this.I'll wait and perhaps when and if Jordan finishes the series and given that I'm still alive, I'll purchase the last book, because I really DO want to know what happens to everybody. Perhaps, if the gaps in my knowledge of the story are compelling enough maybe I'll buy the other 10-15 books (in used paperback form).There has to be many much better and more interesting books out there than CoT. I'd rather take my chances with other writers than continue with one who has definitely lost his touch (or just doesn't care)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I waited a year for this? Anyone want to buy my copy?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ten years ago. I lived in Osaka, before the days of the internet and Amazon.com going to the local book store where English books were sold was a major effort. And when you got there and found a book that you liked you had to pay two to three time the price of the book. The biggest seller of English language books in Osaka is Kinokunia Books. Kinokunia is always filled to the rafters with teenagers reading the latest comic books, that you have fight though to get to the books in English and whose pricing policy of English books is based on an exchange rate based on the yen to dollar rate of the late fiftiesSo one fine spring day I took a forty-five minute train ride to Kyoto and went to Maruzen Books.At Maruzen all the Books in English are on one floor. And in those days when you went that floor it was almost always empty and I could spend hours reading and browsing. That day when I went to the SF/ Fantasy section I saw four fat books that changed my life. They were the first four books in Robert Jordanfs Wheel of Time. I bought all four books. I became a wheel of time junkie. I had friends and family in America, England and Australia looking for more of these books for me and once every two or three months I would take the train to Kyoto. And when ever I got a new one I spends two weeks reading it as slowly as I could. Sometimes I felt let down, books four and seven were not very interesting but still they made me feel as if something was going to happen in the next book. So I would start the wait again.The Cross Roads of Twilight was the most disappointing book in the Wheel of Time series. Other than Mat and the Daughter of the Nine Moons playing cat and mouse with each other there was nothing of interest going on in the story"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'll keep this short. Hundreds of pages of fluff. Lengthy unnecessary descriptions. Nothing happens. The plot isn't advanced. The book isn't worth buying even at a discount. For me the series is over. I'm never reading another."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am ready to give up on Mr. Jordan and this series. The first 6 or so books in this series only took me about 3 nights each to read, 7-9 took me awhile longer. The 10th took me over a month to finally get through it. No action, slow slow slow. He actually seems to be stretching this line out for every penny. When he takes a half a page just to describe what someone is wearing, its time to move on to a new author. He is doing what drove me from reading Stephen King. Long pointless dialog. The editors need to get on Mr. Jordan to end this. When the next novel comes out I will be reading the reviews of it before I buy it. If everyone is complaining, I will be passing it up. Everyone should, just to give Mr. Jordan the message that enough is enough."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Waste of time.

Terrible."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan's newest Wheel of Time novel, Crossroads of Twilight just can't keep my interest. The first few books in the series were well written and full of new ideas. Now that Jordan is finally starting to tie things up (a relief), he is unable to maintain the excitement of previous work. He has so many different plot lines that he is keeping track of and such a high level of intensity in all of them that it is difficult to care about any of them. The characters that were stubborn in the beginning are still stubborn now. They have developed in skill and experience but not in wisdom, and that adds to the problem. Why care about characters that are always the same? What is noble or worth admiring in a character that does not grow? If you want a good read, I suggest you try the Robert Jordan. If you read this series anyway, you are likely to get hooked, like me and just have to finish it despite your better judgement."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you miss this addition to the Wheel of Time series don't worry, nothing much happens in the book anyway! I am sad that yet agian Mr. Jordan has failed agian to move the series forward. I was so enthralled by the first 7 books and have been waiting for story development to continue. I am still waiting. It seems Mr. Jordan has lost interest in this series and is perhaps contracted to provide books for the series whether he has more to add to the story or not.The relationships between the characters that made this series so great have become lost in the details. The wait was not worth it and I personally have lost interest in the story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I couldn't put the first book in this series down. That has not been the case as the series progresses, or, in the case of this book, hardly moves at all. It was amazing to me that Robert Jordan could spend almost 700 pages with nothing happening! He could have shown us the decisions these characters made in a chapter each. Since book 2, it has been true that each book only contains one major event, but this one didn't even have that! I'm getting so disgusted with the series that I may wait until it ends and buy only the last one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First of all, I'm a die hard TWoT series. I've been following the progress of Rand & Co since TEoTW.But I'm very disappointed with this latest installment of TwoT. Sad to say, RJ seem no longer concentrate on his major characters instead more focus on sub character like Alivia, Alviarin, Elza, Elana, Sashelle, Samitsu, Sumitsu, Sumeko etc...etc...etc even for a die hard fan will require a new glossary just to keep up with this sub-characters.As a previous reviewer stated, CoT is fulled of filler which does not moved the story at all. Do you need 3 book just to rescue Faile while it takes just one to rescue Rand?Do you need 3 books to move Mat from Ebor Dar to whatever while it take 1 book to move Rand & Co from the Two Rivers to Fal Dara.I also does not understand Egwene confusion on the Saidin Cleansing event.To jog back RJ's memory Al Lan Mandragoran is bonded to the Aes Sedai Loyal to her. Although it is a big secret, at least Myrelle Sedai should mention it to Egwene that he seem to be alive after the ordeal which absolutely reject the Forsaken's Weapon of Mass Destruction.Get on with the story RJ before someone else shut my coffin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I opened the book with relish and began reading, in hopes that the previously flagging story line would pick up and fly again. Sadly, that didn't happen. I moped from page to uninteresting page and characters talked and dithered and talked some more.Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. I have stopped feeling for the characters that seemed realistic in earlier books. In this latest installment of the Wheel of Time, the characters seem to be going through motions like mediocre actors in desparate need of a break.Possibly the worst insult is that Rand, The Dragon Reborn, (and supposed main character for the series) doesn't not appear until page 529! Even then, the reader does not stay with him for more than a handful of pages.

There is an almost medieval intrigue in this last book and I enjoyed it fully but not everybody can"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay, here's the deal: A lot of so called WOT fans have been complaining about the last few books (mainly books seven and on) because they are boring and not as interesting as the first six. I will call these people pseudo-WOT fans because it is clear that they do not appreciate \\"The Wheel of Time\\" for it's entire worth, because they only appreciate specific scenes and incredible moments from the first six books (including all of \\"The Great Hunt,\\" Domani's Wells, the battle with Rahvin, etc.).However, \\"Crossroads of Twilight,\\" is a good book in the shear magnitude of what it is building up to in terms of the entire series. It's funny how so many people can complain about book ten not living up to the quality of the first six books when so many things that have not yet been cleared up that began in the \\"wonderful\\" first books will be solved in the next book.I admit, I thought book ten was going to be \\"The One\\" book to rule them all. I was dissappointed because not much really happens. However, after I was done reading, I realized how much is about to happen. For instance (spoilers ahead, beware...) Mat and Perrin will be converging on the Tower of Genji in the Mountains of Mist, confronting the Aaelfin and the Eelfin and saving Moraine; Perrin will be saving his wife, Faile, from thousands upon thousands of Aiel warriors; The white tower will be reunited through ways that will be both warrior-like (action) and political intrigue-like; and the Black Ajah is expanding it's network and hold on the world; and, probably most exciting to me, is that that fearful object from book two, the male a'dam, will be put into effect with what could possibly be the most exciting and intense battle sequence of the series, up until \\"the Last Battle\\" (which, I hope, by the way, to be an entire book because it could possibly be the most incredible reading experience I will ever have).So, honestly, as a TRUE fan of \\"The Wheel of Time,\\" I am telling you that if you truely appreciate the Wheel of Time world and the characters involved, you will appreciate \\"Crossroads of Twilight.\\" It may not be the best book you've ever read, and you may get a little upset with it, but those are the times you need to step away and think about what is actually going on in the series. These pseudo-WOT fans obviously do not understand anything that is going on, because they are to preoccupied with looking for one good reason for this being \\"the last Robert Jordan book they ever read,\\" which is exactly what they've been saying for the last three books. And yet, the pseudo-WOT fans will still pick up book eleven, and when it is \\"the One\\" book to rule them all, will say, \\"I LOVE ROBERT JORDAN, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF HIS WORK!!!\\"At that point, we will all look back at their one star reviews and say, \\"well actually, you wern't.... Sorry sucka!\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series is indeed long, and each book does move at a slow pace. But that is the idea of this series. It is trying to be detailed and somewhat believable for being set in a fictional world. This book does not have any major events happen which keeps it from staying up to par with other entries in the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"All these \\"nothing happens\\" reviews are clearly being written by people who don't actually READ books to find out what happens, or to fully escape into alternate worlds; they just 'read' a book to experience grand plot explosions and gratutitous so-called romance. These are the same people who like shoot-em-up movies with explosions every 7 minutes and who made Titanic the highest grossing movie of all time. They've got no attention span to speak of, and they frankly shouldn't be reading Robert Jordan's work. It's far too good for them. My advice is: if you DIDN'T LIKE COT, QUIT NOW. You won't deserve the fabulous ending that's obviously in the offing.For those who wonder at the \\"lateness\\" of my review, hey, I did what any REAL READER does--I started at the beginning, and worked my way up. The more I re-read Jordan's work, the more impressed I am by how small details add up to enormous things. Even things from TEOTW have consequences in this book. That takes real writing, and serious control of your world.That said, I think that this is the densest piece of work that Jordan's done to date in Randland. I'm still re-reading, trying to pick up all the clues--and some of them are very small--that will help me solve the hundred mysteries included in the series. It will take me until the next one comes out 2 years from now to really be sure of what I think I know about most of them. Jordan is a genius, and I'll pay DOUBLE next time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I liked it, maybe not 5 stars, but someone has to ballance out all the ones who quit at book 8 but still felt entilted to complain."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoy Robert Jordan and regret his passing before this series could be completed but I was very pleased with how I received this order in such a timely fashion and the condition was excellent."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Personally I believe that many of the reviews I have read are a bit harsh. Yes, the book was slow, no it didn't develop the story line much, yes I think that if Robert Jordan wants to go into so much detail about characters who most people dont even care about he should give them their own series. However, this book was quite good once you finished it.so many of these reviews compare Jordan to Tolkein, this is an unfortunate comparison. Yes, the two are very alike, if reversed, they both put somewhat excessive detail into the story, each describing far more than you need to know, however Jordan is getting worse towards the end, while it was tolkein's first story in his trilogy that was unbearable.Yes i am hoping for a conclusion, and soon, and no i am not happy about walking into the bookstore and seeing a prequal on the shelves by an author with an ongoing series i am trapped within, but that does not make this story any worse. If anything i want to read the next book more because of this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is true that the series plot did not really advance throughout Crossroads of Twilight. Nonetheless, I found it to be an enjoyable read. Reading the 10th volume in the Wheel of Time series felt like catching up with some old friends I haven't talked to in a while. I enjoy hearing from them, even though not much has changed in their lives since the last time we talked. Jordan is indeed a very talented writer to be able to make 672 pages of pure exposition with no plot advancement interesting.In my opinion, Jordan has gotten bogged down. He has introduced too many characters and has gotten too attached to each of them. He is trapped in all this exposition and he can't figure out how to move the plot forward without dropping some threads. But he will have to. We can't hover on the brink of war forever."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'll start off by saying I'm somewhat mystified by the anger-filled invective that gets hurled at this series in 85% of the reviews here. This is not the best fantasy book in the world, but come on-I've read stuff that was way harder to get through than this book was.I think part of it would be how I read the series-I first discovered WOT a little less than a year before Knife of Dreams came out. I got to read 7-10 without waiting for them, and with them all in front of me, so if I liked a storyline I could skip ahead and follow it into the next book, then come back and pick the others up later. Also, books 7-11 share a plot and should really be thought of as one book, that reaches its climax in the final chapters of Knife of Dreams. I can certainly understand how someone who waited years between the books could miss this, and feel let down after waiting so long for what was basically 20% of a book. Nevertheless, I suggest people go back and read the books the way that I did-they'll fit together, make more sense, and you might come to like them a little bit.None of this is to say that RJ didn't get really carried away with the series after book seven, and took five books to tell a story that could easily have been told in 3, or maybe even 2. I don't think, as some on this board have suggested, that he was deliberately doing it to bilk his readers-he just got convinced that every subplot, every minor character, every little diversion, was important, indeed necessary. This is the sort of attitude that makes editors necessary, and I'm seriously wondering what happened to RJ's. They seemed to have come back for Knife of Dreams, and hopefully they and Sanderson will do a good job on book 12, and restore the reputation of what really is one of the best fantasy serieses out there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although I have to admit that I was disappointed with this book because of it's lack of any real adventure, I can see why Jordan wrote it the way it is. This book is linking the lives of the characters that have been scattered so that readers can follow more clearly. Although I wanted and was expecting some sort of important event to occur, in truth that would just be giving us a plot line instead of telling the story with skill.This book leaves a lot of loose ends that need to be tied and therefore the next book will surely make up for what this one lacks. Also Jordan's writing ability is also amazing and deserves credit in itself."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For all those Jordan fans out there... after 9 books we are kind of stuck. Come hell or high water most of us are going to see this series out. If you were looking for another action book where a lot gets done as far as story progression think again. Nothing happened in this book!For all of those fans who have been waiting for Mat to finally reappear in the series, Jordan has left us wanting more. I really liked the parts with Mat and I find Tuon to be a really neat character. Mat is an engaging character who needs to have an equally interesting counterpoint. He is certainly growing as a character. But that was less that a fifth of the entire book. I suggest that you wait for the book to come out in paperback. Read the parts with Perrin- who will shock you in this one, and Mat carefully. Skip the part with Elayne entirely - [...] that was boring, and skim the Egwene parts.Overall it wasn't bad... it really picks up at the end, but halfway through I didn't want to keep going."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"More than 600 pages of people in bad moods not doing much.

Robert Jordan has merely produced 700 pages of filler without furthering the story. It was not exciting. In fact, it was dull. The wheel of time did not turn at all with this installment. How much more nothing can I take? Jordan is just producing words to cash in on the readers that fell in love with the beginning of the series. &quot;There are neither beginnings, nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time.&quot; How true..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I too have been reading this series since the beginning. After finishing this book, I may not bother anymore. I definitely won't set aside the time to read the book before checking out the review - like so many have very limited time for pleasure reading, and this book was not a pleasure.Mat and Tuon were interesting, but do you think you kidnap the heir to the Seanchan throne and she just goes along with it? Someing just doesn't jive.Perrin and Fayle and Berelain - I don't even care anymore.I was frustrated when I was halfway through the book and realized that most of the plot entry points were BEFORE Rand cleansed the saidin. Come on, at least get FURTHER than the last book!No new characters until you figure out what the ones you have are up to! I would not recommend this book to anyone but the most hardcore Jordan fan, and it seems there are fewer and fewer of us.I will not buy the next one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Blah Blah, we had some tea. We took a hot bath. Ok, the first 1-6 (or 7) books were fine, but this like 8 and 9 (at least some of it) are PLODDING. I mean really, do we need the detail of them taking a hot bath and having tea with honey in it? Shoot just about the only detail we don't get is them using the latrine or outhouse or whatever.I hate to say it, but this just isn't up to par and I can't believe that his *editors* haven't told him that. While I enjoy the detail that makes his world so real this is way over the top.Message to Robert Jordan: get new editors and pick up the pace. Given the slow pace here, I hope he has the plot written down somewhere so his great-grandchild can finally finish it at book 208."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. I have been a big WoT fan, but this book is very close to killing it for me. The only reason I will read the rest of the series is to finish the story. This book is easily the worst in the series. The story is excessively plodding, it spends massive amounts of page space describing useless details with exacting precision. I found Jordan's style cloying at best in this book, by the end of it, if I saw one more description of how someone looked at someone else, I was ready to throw the book. Most of the contents of the book are political intrigue would be hard to keep straight with expensive project management software. You could distil the book into 3 chapters of genuinely useful and readable story. It is really frustrating to wait 2 years to get a book that virtually nothing important happens in. I believe Jordan is going to lose a large piece of his fan base because of this book, maybe rightly so. I think his publishers and editor should be ashamed that this book made it to print in its current form. Please do yourself a favor, skim it in the bookstore, read the more important parts and put it back on the shelf and in 2 more years, read the reviews, and see if book number 11 is worth reading."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I fell in love with this series during the first several volumes. Winter's Heart was very slow and tedious, but I was willing to forgive that as I figured Jordan was setting the stage for a really intense and exciting Book 10. Clean out the Black Ajah, combine the use of men and women to achieve major new things, etc. Instead, the first time we hear from Rand is page 527! Just how many times can an author remind his readers that things are never what they seem to be and enemies are everywhere? I enjoy reading about the &quot;science&quot; of discovering new uses for the power. There are some in this book, but they pop up out of nowhere, almost an afterthought. What would have been a miraculous discovery in Book 5 doesn't even rate a paragraph, yet we hear endless whining about how worried this person is about his/her particular problem. If I didn't know better, I'd say Jordan took a vacation and had the book written by a Hollywood screenwriter. If, and only if Book 11 had been released concurrently, I could live with this. Since that is not the case, I recommend you wait ANOTHER two years and hope that something will actually happen this time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm amazed at how professional reviewers continue to compare Jordan's work with that of Tolkien. Tolkien's work was long and detailed (loved by some, not by others). Jordans, on the other hand is a tedious waste of paper. Had he disciplined himself to a trilogy, his work might have been tolerable. Unfortunately, he didn't know when to stop. One might have thought that an ex-military man would have had more discipline and foresight.The problem with this series is not that it's long, but that it becomes unoriginal and drawn out. This book stinks of a marketing ploy. The same characters are rehashed in a seemingly never-ending tale.Even half-way in (at which point I must admit I just gave up - only the second time in my life), Jordan had still not moved the plot along. He juggles so many characters and situations, that it takes him about 100 pages to catch up with each &quot;group&quot; of characters, doing exactly ... nothing.It's not really necessary to have so many characters in what ought to be a simple fantasy series. I wonder if Jordan himself is able to keep up with them all. I would not be surprised if he hasn't, as it would explain a lot about the length of this book, and the entire series.It seems to me that Jordan himself knows no end to the story. If he's bored his readers then surely he's bored himself nearly to death.Don't waste your time.."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan has wasted another 800 hundred pages. After such a long wait for this book I was very disappointed when I finished it. The story has moved forward very slightly but it looks like Jordan needs at least another 10 books before we are any where near the end of this story. I suspect by that time even the dark one himself would have lost interest, never mind us mere mortals."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Basically this book is about what everyone else was doing up to and around the time of Rand's little mission at the end of the previous book. In other words, there is as good as no furtherance of the story. But I thought it was still interesting, and funny... The others are right about the pages being filled with page filling descriptions, but I guess I could just see beyond that.So it's a step down from Winter's Heart, but I found it better than The Path of Daggers at least, which was even slower. But don't pick this book up to expect any action, just more details about what everyone except Rand is up to at the current timeline of the story. The part with Mat and a certain daughter of nine moons was enjoyable as always, for instance. Too bad the whole twist of them supposed to get married was so easy to see through.Oh well."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoyed the lambasting you all gave Mr. Jordan for this pale excuse for a book. Thank you all for reassuring me in the belief that I was truly ripped off for buying this book and furthermore, had hours of my life wasted reading this drivel. This is just a note to fellow disenchanted readers, after an hour trying to find a way to contact Mr. Jordan to tell him to wrap it up, I was unable to find any such portal to expell my wrath. I encourage you all to wait until the final installment, and even then, just share the book amongst friends. . . we all have paid far too much for such little entertainment and Mr. Jordan's personal endulgement.

However, it will not force me to pay high hardcover prices - I will wait for paperback or the library to read the next installment. As indicated in many of the other reviews here, the first 6-7 books maintained an attention-grabbing pace, although it had become difficult by book 5 or 6 to keep track of the substantial number of characters and plot lines. I reread the previous books once to catch back up, but with 10 books, I don't think I can spare the time (or have the interest for books 7-10) to do so again.The quality of the writing is still OK, but there are so many characters, plot lines, and colors of silk to make dresses that it is difficult to recall what has happend to/in each. If I wanted to know extreme details of medieval dress, I would probably find books on that subject, not read the WOT. Hopefully, the pace will pick up in the next book and some of these plot lines will be resolved. I am quickly (or slowly, if you go by the pace of the books) losing interest in what began as an excellent series. Almost 700 pages of medieval fashion design and essentially no plot resolution, character development, or interesting events...I don't think so."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm giving this one another one-star performance due to the insulting and sanctimonious comments offered by defenders of the book.

Look at the endless list of one-star reviews....THAT says it all, my friends."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was a faithful Robert Jordan fan until I read this disasterous book. The last book was a little slow, but there was a climax to the book, the story progressed. This book had no climax and very little story progression. In fact it was mostly story regression. The first half of the book was set before the ending of the last book. Nothing happened in this book. Rand was barely mentioned. Perrin was still looking for Faile. Mat was still trudging north. Egwene was still waiting. And Elayne was still pregnant. It's likely a series reader could skip this book and miss nothing in the story.I'll read the next book of course, I just hope Jordan actually moves the story along next time. He continues to introduce new characters which I don't care about. I wish he would focus on the characters which the readers do care about. Also, Jordan repeats himself so much its getting irritating. It is was fine at first, but if I have to read how much the men and/or women gossip according to the opposite sex, I will pull out my hair. Enough is enough...we get it!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've never seen a book that spent so much time going nowhere. In the entire book, nothing happened to advance the story. There was not a single confrontation involving channeling. Come to think of it, there was not a single confrontation. I think that either Jordan has no idea how to finish this story or he is trying milk this series and extend it indefinitely. He'd probably make more money if he wrapped it up and just got down to selling &quot;deluxe gift boxed sets&quot;. At this pace, no one will be around to read the conclusion.

I couldn't give it a zero. It deserves a zero. I can't give any plot points away, because nothing happened. Every character is in the same basic situation at the end as in the beginning. I think just about anybody could have written the same thing for this book. All of the characters go on a path that could have been easily skipped over as stuff that happened between books and did not need to be written. The only reason for this book to be out is so that the series wouldn't be forgotten. I doubt a good fantasy series like this would be forgotten. I think it would have been better for this book to have not been written. It was written and tarnishes the image of an otherwise very good series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It seems many others on this review board have had similar experiences as mine. I started out loving the series, then as it dragged on forever and ever, I quickly lost my enjoyment of reading RJ's books. The first few were excellent, the latest few less so, at the COT awful.RJ's writing is very wordy, and while that worked OK when there was plenty of action in the first books, it's extremely detrimental in the later books, when basically nothing interesting happens. In the previous book to this one, he spends 99% of the book rambling on about people's attire and continuing the immature bickering of his well-developed but stereotyped and unrealistic characters, then spends about 15 pages on action, all of which has so little description you have no idea what's going on and can't really enjoy it.This latest book is extremely boring and doesn't even give you the benefit of 15 pages of action! Definitely glad I borrowed it from the library. Don't bother buying it...I'm wondering, like others in these reviews, if the author is just dragging the series on for the extra $..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the first book in the series that I have been disappointed with. Nothing happens. The last two books I felt were a bit slow and failed to develop or resolve the minor plots, but had important enough endings to warrant reading.There is alot of set up in this novel but Jordan fails to resolve even the minor plots that you expected solved 2 books ago. The most exciting thing that happened in Crossroads was the purchase of a bit of grain.Much of the book revolves around minor characters, when fans of the series are itching to see the main 4-some push on to some kind of ending. In fact, you get bogged down with even more minor characters in this book doing the same sorts of things that you've seen many times before in this series: arguing, cat fighting, back stabbing, being stubborn, humiliating one another, basically the same old same old.Jordan really needs to push the plots involving Rand, Perin, Mat and Egwene forward.I'll probably continue reading the series since I have so much invested in it and I love the characters so much, but I won't be waiting for the next one like I have in the past.Jordan should take a look at George Martin's series and get an idea of how a plot should move forward in each book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the beginning, the Wheel of Time books were fast-paced, rich with character development, and presented a nice admixture of themes from Tolkien, Herbert, and other great authors. But alas, the wheel turns, and the well has run dry. There is hardly any plot to speak of in this book, and the repetition of inane musings and descriptive phrases (smoothing the folds of a dress, tugging at a shawl, etc.) is enough to drive one to distraction. In effect, upon finishing the book, everything about the Wheel of Time universe seems two-dimensional and trite. Perhaps the copy editors at Tor have been told to leave Jordan's writing untouched, or maybe Jordan just hammered through writer's block for the sake of meeting his deadlines. Whatever the reason, you're wasting your time and your money if you buy/read this book. For that matter, hold off on any early purchases of the 11th book until you see more positive reviews."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Crossroads of Twilight is as boring and irritating as I first judged. After (finally) finishing it, however, I realized that, tho' I can't even keep all the minor characters straight (how many Aes Sedai and other channelers have similiar names?--all beginning with the letter &quot;M&quot;?) the women have stopped 'sniffing' (the worst habit) and even reduced their skirt smoothing, skirt clutching and braid pulling (to some degree). Alas, the shawl straightening seems to be coming on strong, and put-upon readers should expect much fringe placement discussion in upcoming volumes. I was surprised to read in one review that Jordan is married to a Tor executive editor--how much becomes clear (if only it did in the book). And how much time has passed recently in this wacky world? Another reviewer mentioned three months over the last four books--no wonder everyone is so frustrated. That pace is possible in, for example, a comic book or graphic novel published every month--but in books coming out every two years? Don't think so. How much time has passed for the characters since the series started? I know it's been about 15 years since the first book was published. The characters may not be aging (or maturing) but we readers cerainly are."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the 10th volume in the long running Wheel of Time series. I am not convinced this series will ever end. Jordan claims that he has known the ending since before he began writing the first book, but it doesn't appear that he is that much closer to completion. He claims there is going to be 2 or 3 more books. But he said that same thing 2 or 3 books ago. We'll see.With that out of the way, I'll start talking about the book. Ever since the incredible ending to Winter's Heart , I've been eagerly waiting for the next WOT novel. A release date was set, and pushed back. Finally I was able to buy this book and start reading. I was expecting and hoping that the book would follow up from the ending of book 9. I soon realized that most of this book takes place at the same time as the pivotal event of Winter's Heart , so while the story can advance for the other characters, not a lot of time will pass (and so not that much closer to the Last Battle). Because of the time constraint, not a lot of action happens. This is not a bad thing because the other characters needed some time to have their stories developed more.The character that benefits from this the most is Mat. He had been sorely lacking in the previous couple of books and his chapters are the best of the novel. Perrin and Egwene suffer from the same problem. Nothing happens until the end of their appearances in the book where Perrin makes a very importance decision that may have serious ramifications throughout the world and Egwene actually acts instead of just sitting at the siege at Tar Valon. Elayne is also featured in several consecutive chapters in the middle of the book and while they are moderately interesting....i'm really wanting the whole succession situation in Andor to be resolved.Even though Winter's Heart had such an incredible ending and my hopes for the pace of the series to pick up again....it hasn't. Crossroads of Twilight is a fast reading book, but there is not a serious advancement of plot. Most likely this is because WOT is really one large book and not a 10 + volume series. It is one story and in any novel, there are slow parts and character development parts....and unfortunately we get entire novels of that. This is one of them.This is not to say that Crossroads of Twilight is a bad book, because it is not. It is a good one (when taken as part of the greater series). I couldn't put this book down and I wasn't ready for it to end.Any complaints I have with the book are ultimately small. I enjoyed Crossroads of Twilight very much and I am already anticipating book 11 in this series even though it will likely be 2 years until I see the next book. The book was good and the series is excellent. While I want more out of some of the books, I'm not disappointed with the series at all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the entire series again....yes I know it was a tedious thing to do, but it was a fun ride and it has been, oh i dont know, maybe 4 or 5 years since I left the WoT world. My initial reading coincided with the perception that this book was a total waste. But I have turned a new leaf and have profound respect for Mr. Jordan and how cohesive his books are.I read the series all the way from the beginning and I was shocked to realize that this is a 20 year old series. The books flow that well.It is as if Mr. Jordan has the entire series in his head and is simply putting it to paper one book at a time (at least until he passed away).Specific to this book, it goes without saying that you must be an idiot to bypass 9 books to read only this book, realizing that this is the 10th book of a very complex and amazing series. I will say that it is not the most *action* packed book, but flows extremely well AS A PART OF THE SERIES.I take exception to the demands of certain reviewers that think each book should be a mini-series with a quick problem, quick fight and feel good ending. This is an epic. It will take its course to resolve.The irrelevant descriptions are at times tedious but no more so than the other books. That is simply Mr. Jordan's style of writing.As I said, Mr. Jordan has been shockingly consistent with his writing. It becomes obvious when you read the series non-stop one book after another.This book...fits, exactly where it is, exactly how it is. Mr. Jordan made the WoT a masterpiece and it was b/c of his writing style that this series is the definitive fantasy saga."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Reading all the bad review, I must agree with most of them. So why putting 4 stars to Mr Jordan?For many reason. The least one is that many of those who criticize will run fast to buy the next book the first day, otherwise Mr Jordan would not sell the millions copies each time.It is obvious that Jordan has somehow lost the control of his story, but I am not sure the he ever intended to control it. He is more like a story teller, and he tell story that takes places at a certain time in a a certain world.In this domain, he is good . The fact that after 7000 pages we are far from the solution to the big question does not withdraw the merit of what was written. Of course his approach of sentiments is quite naive and repetive. I skipped those useless pages, the rest of this world remains quite immersive.If you expect to see and end to the story, then sure, you turn angry and disapointed, but if you just want to read a good story as it comes, then you will not see the time pass. I regret the fact that the main story does not advance but I did not regret the money and time reading what I read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the main, CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT (CoT) is a transitional entry in the WHEEL OF TIME series, though not so mundane a passage as PATH OF DAGGERS. The Prologue is over-long, but the threads of lesser storylines are relegated there. The remainder of the book follows several major players, each for a few chapters before moving on to the next. CoT includes an updated Glossary.Most of the much-harped-on repetitions are absent -- braid tugging, friends wished for when talking with women, and so on. Some exposition is repetitive to series followers, but mininal and required for series neophytes and passers-by.Highlights: Rand and Logain meet. (Still looking forward to a Rand/Galad meeting.) Gawyn makes an appearance. Another old Talent surfaces. Some clarification on which new Forsaken is which. Much groundwork laid for what happens next.Particularly interesting is the expansion on a plot point first raised in EYE OF THE WORLD (Book 1 of the series), one of the myriad things Min saw on first meeting Rand and company. And that's one of the hallmarks of the series: Jordan throws in so many seemingly unnoteworthy details that later come to the fore, revealing only in hindsight their importance, and with little or no revisionist history. Almost as if reading the source of prophecy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had hoped for so much more....well, if one is following the series Crossroads must be read. Now i do not find Jordan horrible even at his most meandering. His prose is easy to read, so the book goes by quickly. I would have liked more content, but still the story does advance, if not enough. Maybe Knife of Dreams will blow us all away! Here's Hoping!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok, I'm a big Robert Jordan fan. I'll give all his critics that, just so they know where I stand. True enough, if you don't have the patience to read a set that will surely top 10,000 pages by the time it's over, then you probably will (or already do) hate these books. And the last installment doesn't conclude anything, so many readers are losing faith in Jordan. There are a few reasons, though, why this novel doesn't deserve the relentless bashing it has recieved.1: Mat and Tuon. I'm really not one to concern myself with \\"couples\\" in fiction, but I love these two together, and they breathe life into the whole work.2: Use of primary characters. Those who have read this far into the Wheel of Time know that a great deal of time is often spent with minor characters, but this novel concentrates far more on the primary characters and storylines than many previous installments have.3: Storyline advancement. Many people say that this book does nothing, but that's because there is not climax. In reality, the early portion of the book is a cool-down period from book 9's climax. For the rest of the book, the primary storylines are gathered together and advanced. To me, this book feels like the proverbial \\"calm before the storm\\". All the loose ends are being gathered together for the grand finale.To be fair, the set IS too long, and the books set up for an ending that seems nearly impossible to pull off. If the final climax of the series meets these expectations, however, it will be one of the towering achievements of the fantasy genre.This book gets slammed because of it's position rather than it's content, and to the rerader who is willing to take his (or her) time, this is a worth-while installment in a series which, if over-long, is nonetheless well written, complex, and deeply engrossing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ever since the fateful prophecy of Matt's future marriage was foretold, I have wondered how RJ would believably develop a love affair between two characters who hadn't even met one-another until Book 9. Rushed love stories are trite and undeserving of such cool characters as Matt and Tuon or of a master storyteller such as RJ. I'm delighted to tell you all that this subplot unfolds excellently! It is as endearing as the Arwen/Aragorn story from Lord of the Rings. For those of you impatient of geopolitical developments, remember that Matt is probably Randland's greatest military leader, and the Seanchen have the world's greatest military. Once Matt marries Tuon (and presumably is made general), he will be as great a force to be reckoned with as Rand, and bigger than Arthur Hawkwing ever was. The other subplots do drag by comparison and we get yet another trademark kidnapping, but Matt has been my favorite character in the series ever since Rand became the Dragon, and I can forgive alot on his account, but all in all the book is probably the second weakest in the series, after POD."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is book ten in a series of books by Robert Jordan called \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" It is a well-written sprawling science fiction fantasy saga about a young man who is born to end up battling with the evil force in the world. He and his friends travel all over the world trying to get everyone on his side, getting ready for the big battle which will decide whether the end of the world will go to the evil one or the good people. But not everyone will believe in him. There is magic, and unseen forces, monsters, strange peoples from far away, all kinds of different unexplainable things happening that can only happen when magic is used. It's a fun read, there are many small plots and twists to follow along the way. I love the story line, and the writer is wonderful. It's very colorful, and it is easy to visualize in your head, based on his descriptions, what is going on. The characters are very real and their personalities are very distinct and some are quite unusual. I have looked forward to each book as I have gone along through the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished reading the newest installment in the Wheel of Time series, and contrary to what seems to be the popular opinion here, I found it an engaging and enjoyable read. Granted, the book lacked the momentous, earth-shaking events of many of the previous books. I did not find that this detracted from the story in a significant way, however. Rather, it whetted the appetite for what is sure to be a rousing race to the finish line in subsequent entries. I can see that the series is entering its final lap, the shape of the story to come is starting to materialze, and it looks promising. I will be eagerly looking forward to the next installment in the series.Some specific highlights of the book: Mat Cauthon on the move and back in old form again. The stage set for a (surprising?) resolution to the Seanchan plot thread. An interesting twist in the siege of Tar Valon. The title of the book was perhaps the most apt since &quot;The Dragon Reborn.&quot; Tuon is the best new character in quite some time.Some lowlights: Perrin's thread was uninspired and a little confusing. Elayne's thread was too short. Too many Aes Sedai, all similar to each other. A few strong representative Aes Sedai characters, instead of a multitude of weak ones would be much better, I think. My favorite villian has gone missing.My primary complaint about the series as a whole is that the amount of time between books is much too long. For material this good, though, I am willing to be patient. I heartily recommend this new book if you are at all interested in a well-written, engaging story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once I started the first I was hooked on the whole sereies.

The series started out great and I hungrily read one book after another then the story got weak, then it got pathetic, then it just ground to a halt. The good news is I knew enough not to buy book 9 or 10. After looking at these reviews, I can see I made the right choice. So did the series finally end or is it still running on and on like bad case of diarrhea?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; was better than the reviews I've read had led me to expect. I found it exciting and oddly tedious at the same time. I guess it's all that waiting for something to happen . . . Seriously, Book 11 has to be make or break for The Wheel of Time. I'll do Jordan the credit of saying that all the elements now seem to be in place, enough so that some serious fireworks should occur from now on (&quot;Seem&quot;, &quot;should&quot; - okay, I'm optimistic).There was not much of a story in &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. The book largely comprised updates on all the characters, rather than any real action, and I was surprised by the things Jordan chose to focus on, at the expense of some very important things taking place &quot;off-screen&quot;. I can cope with the physical descriptions of new characters, as we all need something to hang a name on with such a large cast, but the minutiae of trays, dresses, and layouts of tents really serves little useful purpose and did come across as padding in this book. Some of the characters are as engaging as always . . . while some are their usual annoying selves. Sadly, only one of the Forsaken appeared very briefly, so no news on what the side of evil is planning now; but for the alert reader there was plenty of sub-text to pick up on, to do with various varieties of skullduggery.Perhaps the biggest flaw of &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; is that the momentous events at the end of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; are not engaged with. I truly do hope Jordan has it all mapped out and is not inventing on the fly . . . (Though a number of things do suddenly appear in his books without being previously referenced, such as towns or Aes Sedai secrets, and become new favourites to be used at every opportunity).So why three stars, you ask? Because three stars is to me a book worth reading, and I'm judging (perhaps unwisely) in the context of the series as a whole. And Jordan below par still beats most authors out there, for me."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"... horrible WASTE of time!What a huge collection of hot-aired babble!

Jordan may have created his own down fall by creating and tackling such a huge task. WOT is a major work and should be viewed as a whole. Unfortunately when 2-3 years pass between stories its hard to view as a complete work. I make it a point to reread the entire set before each new book so I can feel the continuity of the series. That being said I am disappointed by how little happened. The last two books feel like episodes of Friends to me. I say that because they're well written, nothing seems to REALLY happen in any one episode and this whole book wouldn't make 30 minutes of television. The issues that are discussed are left to be resolved later. We get to feel the backlash of the events of the last book. That was a nice touch to see that what happened WAS earth shattering and world changing. But it didn't develope past that point."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With the exception of Elayne getting pregnant and Rand cleansing the male part of the source, nothing happened in the LAST book either. All this book does is introduce so many meaningless characters that Mr. Jordan has run out of original names.

Yes, that must be it? Sometimes, though, you can feel the original Jordan being present. Years from now, when the WOT books have reached an explosive ending, this book will be a classic. \\"The horrible nr. 10\\" people will call it, as they do even now, in fact.Reading all the angry rewiews here at amazon.com is worth five stars alone.Charles Dickens once said \\"let them cry, let them laugh and let them wait\\" about his writing, and the expectations of his audience.Jordan is not Dickens, but there is a lot of crying, laughing and waiting going on here, I see.Five stars to this strange book because it is the strangest book in the series.

True, there was little action and much detail in the book, but it's a great book to read anyway, and if you don't like much action, you should read a thriller or wath a movie instead. The details adds to the book, but it's not for readers who seldem reads books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've seen alot of reviews on here saying that Jordan should haved stop writing after book 8 or that he is drawing out these books to make more money. If you don't like his books don't buy them. These books are pretty good they aren't the greatest, but they are a good read. The new characters and plot lines add to the story not take away there is only so much a person can do with the same characters, even someone with Jordan's talent. I read this book just before I left for Iraq and I've reread most of the books all over again while I've been out here, and I found them to still be good books to read again. Because some people want the books to end now doesn't mean that they should there is to much story that has not been closed and Jordan needs to do this to properly end this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I agree with the complaint most people have that the 10th installment is not as good as some previous efforts, I disagree with all the criticsm. The book is extremely detailed, possibly a little too much, but it is extremely well written. The character developement Jordan undertakes is a testament to his genius. I have read few other books that give the reader so much insight into the inner workings of the characters. Jordan undertook an enormous task in the early books by developing so many major characters. Even the critics must agree that the character developement is what has made this epic so magnificent. When a writer can make his readers become attached to the characters, he/she has truly become a master of the craft.By the time we reach this 10th book, the story lines are so divergent, yet Jordan has clearly begun to bring them back together. Rather than see this as a loss of control as some critics have said, I see this a testament to the grand story telling ability Jordan posses. He has been able to blend multiple characters into a singular story line early on, then allow each character to delve into a unique yet connected journey. Jordan coud have easily written multiple books dealing with each of these separate characters. Maybe this would have enabled him to keep the faster pace of the first 5 books, but he instead has kept them all together in a time ordered manner which moves slower, but works just as well. This 10th offering delivers the makings for a grand reintroduction of the multiple story lines back into a well defined finale. I applaud Jordan's moxy in undertaking the telling of this epic odyssey. This book while not as exciting as previous volumes and having extraneous prologue, plays a major role in the development of the story. I enjoyed reading it and look anxiously towards the next volume."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book was wonderful, as can always be expected from Jordan, yet it was still more set up for future events. However, now these events are coming closer and closer. I'm sure the next book must contain incredible things, with how excited this book made me. The pace stayed the same throughout the book, yet somehow I loved it. There are many moments or suspense or excitement, where nothing happens, as only a master storyteller can create. It's like the feeling you get when in a horror movie and you think something will happen, and then it doesn't. It just makes it scarier when it does.My only real quibble with the book, is its weak conclusion. I had hoped it would at least follow the others with a major event at the conclusion, but I was disappointed in that aspect.We can look forward to more action packed books in the future. There are still several countries to bring to Rand, not to mention Shara and the Seanchan. I can see a good four more books to come, and I'll probably love them all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay I consider myself a very big Wotfan. I got CoT on day 1, and I think I am one of the seemingly few people that really enjoyed it. I remember with WH, my expectations were way too high and I think I found the book a little disappointing because of that. With this book, I really just took things as they were, and I found I could appreciate everything in the book a lot better. I even liked Elayne's chapters a lot, and have never been more amazed at the consistency and accuracy that Jordan has in keeping this story straight and telling it masterfully. Yes, i noticed every time a woman smoothed her skirts, but that's not what's important. I guess the women Randland like to do that sort of thing. More importantly though, and I think this has been touched on before, I love how wot has expanded. I like the glacial movements of the plot due to a wide expanse of interesting and integral characters, all of whom are entirely believable and whose actions I never question except when i disagree with a decision one has made. Thats what keeps me coming back. I think the majority of readers are having a hard time accepting that the early days of this series are done; it underwent a slow transformation, and its focus has expanded, and it did so in a very believable way. The scale of these books is enormous, and the story is amazing; I think if one were to consider the impact of this story as a whole; the progressions in situation and character... one would see that Jordan's style is entirely unique, the perfect blend of fairy tale and realism, creating a result that is mindnumbing in its complexity and scale. When the series is done, it will be the first of its kind; the type of story that people will love to lose themselves in for a period of time; these poeple wont care about how long the wait is between books, or which characters are mentioned 'too little' or whether the climax is weaker in a certain book or if it is lacking a major battle scene... these people will be involved in the entire story; they will realize that Rand isnt in CoT becasue he doesnt do anything important; that he is tired from the cleansing, and recuperating. In fact, these future readers will appreciate his short appearance more because of the dimension it adds to plot and scale. Everything in this world is timed out to a T; and Cot is an edition just as worthy of respect as any other. The advantage we have to waiting in between books is that we get to theorize and ask questinos.Those of you who say 'Jordan has lost his touch' or that one could skip 'book 10 and go on to book 11' im sorry to say, have sadly missed the Wot boat."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The story just pulls you in and holds you until the very end.Like the other books in this series, I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After the disappointments of the several books preceding this one, it came as a surprise to see that Jordan was returning to his A Game. There are still many problems even though this book was better then many of the last few in the series. Rereading them, especially when you can not get to the conclusion gives you a pause to really evaluate what each book is.Again because we do not get to the end of the story, more can be found to fault the telling of the story. (You would know we had because some way 'THE END' would appear.) New details in the travelogue that is the The Wheel of Time occurs. Alton Brown cruising around the US on Asphalt, or Mark Twain in Roughing It. We have Jordan having created a map with a great many lands, so why not ensure we as the audience know how diverse it is.The problem therein is that we don't care. The Map has never had the detail it needed to find a great many of the places mentioned. Battles can not be followed because they are impractical and are just literary voyeurisms. The battles could have been summed even more quickly, Good guys show up, have smaller force, use power to win. If you try to look at it in military context, it will do you no good, as will understanding logistics which Jordan tries to give a nod to.Big armies need big food. Even the many thousands of Shaido need food, but they don't, and again with the contradictions when the Forsaken sent the septs all over to be destroyed, now they seem to be getting back together? Oh, Jordan smacks his head wanting a V-8, in revisionist writing, this is even better five or ten years after I originally wrote the other scenes that I'll just change things.Another exploration of Tell, don't show is revisited in ever bigger details which as the writing started to be denser again, or the fonts tighter, showed that the travelogue needed to be expanded.Screen time is also getting shorter and shorter for characters as each is fighting for time on camera. Including Rand. The Protagonist, but the series is so large, that he is not as important as he was before. We have to remember as early as book three we were already pushing off the center stage.But as Rand points out, he is the one who has to show up at the final climax chapter to fight, everyone else we have grown fond of, does not really need to be there. Thus we get into the exploration of why they are on screen so much. They need to be ready.In the early books of the Travelogue we saw how big the world was, and as the characters criss-crossed it, they were learning. But now they are as wise as I in the space of 3 years of book time and twenty years of reading time.These last books Jordan accelerates the time scale and he should not have. For what our leaders want to accomplish, they do need more time and seasoning. One William Pitt the Younger in a generation please. Not six, seven, eight... Who can keep track.But is there anything else to read as good with as much depth. No. On to the next."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think that this book was great. Not brilliant, but great. I looked forward to getting home and reading it. Sure, it was YET ANOTHER build-up. But that will just makes the end of the series even better. Some people say Robert Jordan doesn't know how to end this series. Would you be able to, and do it justice? I know I wouldn't. I've read series before that I've hated seing the end of. I for one would love there to be another 20 books of this series. I read them for the enjoyment and entertainment or reading, not so that I could see the end of it. If you're looking for a conclusion, you might not enjoy this book - read it anyway, it's worth it"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan must want to drag this series to 1000 books. There is no progress in the storyline in this book. I enjoyed the first 5 books in this series but they got progressively slower in advancing the story. I hoped the story would eventually reach some kind of conclusion, but now I have lost all hope. I was extremely disappointed by this book, so I am writing my first review to prevent further agony. This is the worst book I have ever read. I'll never buy a book by Jordan again. Try the Ice Wind Trilogy by Salvatore to get a book with action and a reasonable conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like so many others before him Mr Jordan gets to a certain point in the story and begins to write fill. No substance just filling pages. I notice this with Terry Brooks as well. This is really unfortunate, as it kills the reading excitement and you begin to lose interest. I'm sure this is a money thing to stretch the story into as many books as possible, but enough already. It may be Mr Jordan's purpose in life to write this never ending saga, but it is not my purpose to read it. I'm finished with the wheel."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I absolutely loved the first few books in the series. Then I started to get tired of waiting for some of the story lines to continue. The characters, after all, are so complex and have so much going on. So I got one book, then another, then another - and finally realized that Jordan is milking this for all it's worth! He's never going to resolve anything because he's making too much money stretching it out, and stretching it out, and stretching it out...... Could we have a little more action instead of pages and pages of bland, totally unnecessary descriptions and feelings, please? This is finally it for me. I will not buy another book of his in this series. I'll miss the characters, but it won't be nearly as bad as having to read through 100 pages of drivel per scene! Hey Robert - good premise, but you're losing it!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I give up! I'm not going to bother reading another Wheel of time book until the series is complete (if that ever happens). I have read over 600 pages so far and absolutely nothing has happened. Actually, \\"read\\" is a little strong... I began skimming pages after page 300 or so.The first four or five books in this series were really good. Good enought to keep me, and many others, coming back for more. Even after reading THOUSANDS of pages of neverending gibberish, I had faith that at some point it would turn around. HA! The joke is on me!This series has become an absolute disaster. What a shame for something that had so much potential. At this point, I can't even imagine how Jordan will bring it to an end. For that matter, I have ceased to care..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I, like many others, started out as a huge fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.Books 1-4 were excellent. Well written and edited. Great storytelling.Unfortunately, books 5 and 6 really slowed down to a snail's pace. There were a few chapters of the original style, but for the most part the storytelling gave way to extended descriptions.I must point out here that I only continued with the series because I had been hooked by the 1st 4 novels and really just wanted to know how the series panned out.Books 7, 8, and most of 9 were utter rubbish. Minimal plot advancement and incredibly dreary writing. The series is obviously being milked for ever dollar & the ratio of filler to actual plot is around 20:1!The last few chapters of 9 sped up though and I admit I had *slightly* higher hopes for book 10.Even with low expectations, I was disappointed.Crossroads of Twilight is an utter ab.ortion of a book.I will go so far as to say it is the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading.It is a *complete*, and I can't emphasise this enough, WASTE of time. Nothing happens during the entire course of the book.(The entire book could easily have been condensed down to a single chapter without losing any required plot information).It starts before the previous novel finishes - and there are about 500 pages before RAND is even mentioned. There is little to no storytelling ... just excruciatingly boring levels of descriptive detail interspersed with completely irrelevant, banal character conversations that serve little purpose & advance the plot not a jot.There is an inane sideplot involving Perrin and a \\"city of the dead\\" that doesn't fit anywhere with the existing story arcs, and just feels like filler (basically an excuse to have Perrin in the novel).It's not written well, and if it's been edited at all I'd be shocked. There are quite a few glaring grammatical errors, not to mention spelling mistakes! And given that this book is already a ponderous bore, these only serve to further distract the reader.This novel was so unenjoyable I had to literally force myself to open it each evening (the only reason that I got through it is solely due to the fact that once I start a book, I never leave it unfinished).There is little point in reading this novel apart from skim-reading the chapters involving Matt and Tuon. This is the only area where any development takes place, and is therefore the only prerequisite to reading book 11.Mr. Jordan,Bring on the finale to this series and spare your remaining readers the ignominy of having your novels drag their IQs down with them any further."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan's continued slide into the abyss of worthlessness continues unabated. While most of his books contain hundreds of pages of filler, this one has nothing else. No plot advancement occurs at all. A complete waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am dissappointed in the reviews which critizes those of us who dislike this book. I read a review titled 'Only for the enlightened' which refers to everyone who dislikes the book as 'simpletons'. To that reader, I would like to make a point. If you chose to actually read the negative reviews, its not all about readers whining about the lack of 'hack and slash' action. The readers are complaining about lack of closure, every expanding storyline, redundant details, useless details, lack of face time for the main characters, unbelievable storylines, storyline progression, character development,.....etc. Many of the reviews are different from each other and far from simple. Just because someone disagrees with your opinion does not make them simpletons....that makes you arrogant."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When this book first came out in hardcover I waited...and bought the paperback. Now I'm really glad I didnt pay the exorbitant price of the hardcover. The speed of this 10th book is nothing at all compared to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd books.... it's slow! It all started going downhill for me starting from the 8th book. The characters are tedious now and although once I was fascinated by all the strong female characters in the series, now I'm tired of all their scheming and whining- the dirty looks... it's just plain annoying now. And I'm not even done reading the book yet! I find I'm having a hard time getting myself to finish reading the book. It's been so long since I've read the last book and who are all these new characters anyways?? It's getting too confusing and boring to read!I'm not sure if I will buy the next one...

Somebody please shoot me.I decided after Lord of Chaos that I would continue buying into this crappy series only if the next book (Crown of Swords?) was the last one. Hahaha - how happy am I that I made that vow instead of being like the poor suckers saying 'maybe book 12 will pick up and tie it all together'. Poor sadsack, deluded, readers.We'll all be dead before Jordan (or should I say Satan!) finishes this dull, pathetic series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book stinks. I really enjoyed the series for the most part, although things started to seem pretty pointless in places beginning with &quot;Crown of Swords&quot;. I thought the ending of &quot;Winters Heart&quot; was absolutely spectacular, and it really excited me about this book (the next in the series). However, this book was a total let down. It totally defused the climax of the last book since NOTHING HAPPENS. Ok, stuff happens, but it doesn't advance the plot, it just stalls it. Endless new side plots, worthless new characters.Personally, I don't care how long Robert Jordan takes to wrap up this series. HOWEVER, advance the plot, you jerk. If it takes five more books to tie everything together and end it, then so be it. But start tying it up. It's time to end side branches, bring people together, and stop introducing new characters and plot lines."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I used to love the WOT series and recommended it to all my friends, but I can't recommend this book at all.Basically, nothing happens, the plot isn't advanced at all.

In fact, I may have read this book twice without any hint of recollection. I think fans of this series can safely skip this book without any loss of continuity. If you absolutely need to read it for yourself then simply skip to the last chapters featuring Perrin, Mat, and Egwene. These three chapters contain ALL of the plot developments. As for the rest of the chapters:* Elayne and Rand do nothing.* There are no battles.* Nothing important happens to any major characters.The good news is that an editor/author will make a truly great work some day by producing an abridged/plagiarized version of this story. Just three volumes, 1500 pages, and non-stop action. This will be the fantasy classic that will be read by generations to come. Too bad Jordan/TOR let go of the reins and allowed greed to run rampant over an extremely promising storyline."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I agree with 99.9% of the reviews here. The amazing thing is there are so many of them, but the first book was so good! It's so frustrating the way the story broke into so many concurant stories and half the time they sit around talking about what so and so is going to do (and you could care less cause you already know what so and so did in the last chapter). Get these morons some magical cell phones or something so I don't have to go through these boring endless what if sessions (I just skim over them anyway, oh yeah it would be helpful if he would add 'Begining of boring endless what if session' and 'End of boring endless what if session' to help my skimming). Like so many others I'm stuck reading Jordan's cash cow because I liked the first few books so much, but I'll read reviews of the next book first and probably pick it up second hand. Get the main characters back together and write one story!

I was terribly wrong.This book is potentially interesting... for those of you who are interested in nothing aside from tea and the exact array of every individual thread on every dress.To be blunt, this book sucks."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Usually, a writer writes because he/she has a story to tell. When a writer creates a world, he/she also knows every single detail that describes that world. But a GOOD writer will know what details are important to the central story, and what details are not.Obviously, Robert Jordan no longer knows what details enrich a story, and what details serve merely as padding. Yes, it is sometimes interesting to hear about an event from another character's point of view. However, unless this is somehow pertinent to the main storyline, it is completely unnecessary. At least, 500 pages of repetitive description that is extremely insignificant is just a waste of paper.My suggestion is that if you must read this book, definitely get it from your library as I did. If you would like to read a book just to understand how to not write a book, then you should read CoT. If you are hoping for plot resolutions or even just plot movement, you will be sorely disappointed. Strong characters have withered into cardboard cutouts; and that to me, is the most disappointing aspect of this series.

I've however been more and more disappointed with the books since the 5th book and can barely stomach them now. I will continue to \\"read\\" them, actually audiobooks for me, until they're completed by B.Sanderson, the new author assigned to the story, in the hopes that he will be able to pull it all together.

I find myself skimming 12 pages of character introductions only to have half the characters leave within the next few pages never to be seen again through the rest of the book. Robert Jordan introduces far too many characters to remember and adds too much slow pace \\"climax building,\\" and it is getting on my nerves. I wish something would happen to advance the plot. Quite frankly, I can no longer even stand to read anything to do with Perrin. So little that is interesting has even happened with this character through the series and will most likely stay my least favorite character.Since Perrin decided to save his wife in the ninth book, this character has had so little to do with the story that I don't see why it's even in there. I read his perspective and I don't even see anything that could be even a hint to things to come to pass for much too long. This book hardly mentions Rand. It starts focusing on reuniting the white tower, continuing to build climax, but going so slow in the story line filling hundreds of pages with pointless in depth introductions of nobody characters.

Classics like Lord of the Rings will always come back and forever be revered (and continue earning at a serious pace.) What you have done, or have been coached to have done, is potentially lose that possibility forever for short-term gain.I have purchased the last eight books of your series in hardcover, but I will not purchase the next addition, even when it comes out in paperback.

At the very end of book 10, he finally makes a little movement in the plot. Also, i was not liking the women in the book. they were no longer characters, but were just sounding like a bunch of steryotypical women, very dissapointing. although i am definitely going to buy the next book, there were just too many options for where the plot could have gone in book 10 that he just did not even address, and if he does not start picking up the pace in the next book, im moving on as much as it will hurt me. if i werent so intrigued with \\"randland\\", i would just give up now."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan needs to finish this series and get back to the action!

However, I'm reading much of the same criticisms that have existed since the aforementioned Book 7 and, not surprisingly, more and more of them seem to be of the negative variety. There was one positive one, however, that deemed it &quot;transitional.&quot; WHAT?! That's what the Pro-Jordanites have been saying for the past three books! How many transitional volumes do you need?! Oy!Just a suggestion: if you're fed up with WoT, do yourself a favor and start reading George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. Yes, it's also a series that isn't set to a certain number of volumes, but the reader gets an idea that things are steadily, if not rapidly, coming to a head (heck, if all subsequent volumes are as good as the first two, I'm almost tempted to say the series can go on forever - something I can't even come close to saying about RJ's &quot;Make it Stop&quot; series). And, true, they're just as enormous as Jordan's books; however, things actually happen, the plot actually advances and more pages are utilized developing character and story than are squandered describing what people wear.

As long as you are prepared for that the book won't disappoint you TOO much.I wasn't prepared for that though, so 2 stars it what it gets.Anyway - I will stick with the Wheel of Time series to the end for one main reason - books 1-3 might be the 3 best books I ever read, and I've read quite a bit of fantasy.(Wizard First Rule &amp; series, Rhapsody &amp; series by Elizabeth Haydon, George RR Martin etc.)In short - don't expect much and Crossroads might exceed your expectations.

I don't think that one plot advanced one iota. There was no mention of Nynaeve or Lan (oh yeah she was sitting in a tree when someone crossed a courtyard, he was fighting). There was more time spent on characters who are not central to the plot than to the main players.

But whereas in the past I would have recommended to friends and strangers to pick up the series, I can't do that anymore. Three of the last four books (instalments 7, 8, and 10) have pretty much sucked; book 9, Winter's Heart, reminded me why I love the series, but CoT betrayed any good-will WH had restored. I recommend not reading the Wheel of Time series until it is concluded, and there's no telling when that will be. So, gentle reader, check back in about 5 years and see where the series is. But even if it's done by then, Jordan has meandered so far afield from the heights of the series, the Wheel may not be worth the time it takes to ride."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time series and loved the first 8 books.

As Mr. Jordan continues, his stories are becoming less and less interesting and one is left disappointed. Though there are some good parts, much of the book is quite tedious and since it's been so long since the first book, it took a bit of time to remember everyone this round!

Since then I've graduated from college and have been in the working world for over 4 years. This series seems to go on forever with no end in sight. Sixty years from now when I'm 85, book 46 will be just coming out. Book 46 will consist of 500 pages of Rand thinking about the butterfly that just landed on his shoulder (killing it or not killing it could be the difference in the war between good and evil), and we will be no closer to the end of the series.Needless to say, I was tremendously disappointed by the glacial plot movement in this book. Little to nothing happened that was of any import, and the story has grown to include way to many supporting characters that I just don't care about. It's a shame because the first 6 books in the series were exceptionally good, but now it seems that RJ is artificially dragging the series out. At this point I probably won't buy another book in this series until the last book is released.

As do all his peers, friends and family. One-and-a-half stars after 1,800 reviews is a monumental humiliation.Please, Mr. Jordan, finish this series ASAP."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The reason why it never ends? 1800+ reviews of the same thing. Okay, time for the answer:simple...Jordan is afraid to end this. The series has defined him and been a part of his life so long that he is actually afraid to end it. Because he can't see beyond the series. And there's that fear that once this is done, then there is no more of many things. Therefore he is procrastinating and obfuscating, delayinging finishing it. He keeps creating subplots and detail to almost the molecular level (thanks to one of the spotlight reviews for that!) to postpone the enevitable choices he is afraid of making. Jordan has a serious dose of avoidance and his readers are those who suffer for it! And this book is yet another in a line that is become increasingly immobile.Okay when you read this think about it a little bit. Just don't jump to his defence or whatever. This is correct. The evidence fits. This is why it is the way it is. So I proffer the opinion that short of a serious kick in the pants, this series isnt going to end anytime soon. And I don't think there is going to be any significant advancement either. Until Jordan overcomes his avoidance and fear of choice, then expect more of the same. Which is a real shame. I don't think this is about the money. I think it's deeper than that. I think he just can't let go, so he, as the god of the world he created, is doing everything in his power to keep it alive. I think he's too infatuated with his power in that world and is too attached to it. He writes for himself. Of course, because he is the god of that world.

This is old and worn out, and he desperately needs to move away from this theme.What point did this book serve really? The events in this book, literally, span the course of a few days time since Winters Heart ended, the interesting thing is that the vast majority of this book is written of events going on when Rand was cleansing the male source.In all, I find this book tired, uneventful and an utter failure if it was an attempt to propell the storyline. I can understand the descriptive paragraphs (which when compounded, more likely than not take up more than 2/3rds of this book) if this was one of the first books in the series, but to continue to reiterate that Dominai women are flirty, that borderlanders are hard men, that Cairhienians play the Game of Houses the best of all, that the Aiel just cannot understand wasting so much water as to take a bath in it, etc etc is just not needed.

Let's be honest here, Robert Jordan is a passable science fiction/fantasy writer, but not on the same level as Tolkien. Whereas Tolkien took years of careful editing and background development to deliver the product that became known as \`Lord of the Rings', Robert Jordan treats his readers with a palpable lack of respect. Instead of tight characterization, detailed plot development and a sense of pacing, we are given thousands of pages of loose threads, insufferable character motivations and political scheming that is, at best, sophomoric.This series is just not fulfilling. Admittedly, this has to do more with the tastes and demands of the reader; but it must be admitted that at certain sections of the series, you grow weary of the introduction of random characters for the sake of exposition.Many readers will point to the first four books in this series as evidence of the originality of its author. Unfortunately, good ideas are not enough to sustain a group of books as long or as wordy as \`The Wheel of Time' has grown to be.For some reason, there is a fundamental lack of \`personality' to the series - characters engage in actions for no reason, and even the main protagonists in this long winded \`epic' are reduced to quirks and habits for no reason but to fill space in the pages.As a reader of historical fiction and the occasional fantasy book, there are many examples of authors who handle myriad characters, plotlines and are still able to combine these elements into a cohesive whole. The \`Shogun' series, \`Dune' series, \`Song of Ice and Fire', and \`The Other Boleyn Girl' are just a few examples where the authors developed a certain style and characters which created a sense of tension and allowed the reader to maintain interest.As far as I can tell, this series (especially \`Crossroads of Twilight') is verbose with a lack of sensible characterization. This reader gives \`The Wheel of Time' out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have valiantly tried to slog my way through this series.I will often read a book that bores me just because I feel compelled to finish.10 books.

As an earlier reviewer mentioned, this could be the birth of a new art form :) I can't wait until his next book is published and can only hope that it garners reviews as entertaining as those for this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read quite a few reviews here and the seem(with a few exceptions) to fall into two main categories:a) this book was awful, Jordan hates us, ..., I'd rather climb a tree, staple my tongue to the trunk and jump out than ever read this again, etc. etc. etc.b) everyone who thinks a) is the case is [someone] who is either not patient enough or just cannot comprehend the sheer magnitude of Jordan's geniusThe truth is somewhere in the middle. You're not going to find action like you did in earlier books, and if #1 or #3 was your favorite, you're probably going to be disappointed. However, a couple of words in Jordan's defense:1. Quite a few people I know complained about not being able to keep straight all the different plot lines. I think this book was an attempt to get everyone up to speed. (One can debate if this was needed on not, but I'm not sure the villification of Jordan is really appropriate here)2. I suspect that Jordan got in a little over his head with all of the plot lines, and it's going to take quite a bit of time(and pages) to pull it all together.That being said, I still have to admit that at times I found myself skimming parts of the book and even thought to myself that reading CoT was like doing \\"required reading\\" for a High School english class. At the same time, there were good passages in this book, and I fully expect the last book in the series to be excellent, because I think we'll see a return to the pacing and focus that made this series famous.I think what stands out for many people is that this series just isn't as much fun to read as it used to be. All in all, I, like many other people will likely take a break from this series until the last book is published, at which time I'll get one of my friends to catch me up to the point where I can enjoy the conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This latest installment from Jordan is the icing on the cake as far as how BAD this series has become. The first book in the series was very good, and each book since then has decreased in quality. This series was originally intended to be 7 books. One can only surmise that due to the popularity of the series Mr. Jordan has decided to string things out, to what else, line his pockets with money. Let's face it, this is the only series that Jordan has written that has sold very well. Since he makes a living on writing, it only makes sense that he keep writing this rubish as long as fools like me keep buying. Mr. Jordan has fallen in line with other successful series by Eddings, Feist, Anthony, and Brooks. Each started out with a trilogy and then kept expandiing...ie. trilogy #2, #3 and so on. As far as the current book is concerned, we had to wait until page 540 before the key firgure, Rand, even spoke any words. In prior books at least, Mr. Jordan would mundanely take us through 600 snoozing pages and build to a climax over the last 50 pages or so. This book takes the cake in that there was no climax, just filler. Finally, there's something to be said about character development. In this series however, we have character overload. There must be a couple of hundred characters that I defy anyone can keep straight in their head. If I could give this book a 0 I would."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The best way is to keep your climaxes long and drawn out. Jordan has managed to do this over the last three or four books now, and he shows no sign of lessening the pace. Of course, he does this by stopping all action is his books and splintering the story off into a dozen or so fragments so you have to buy all twenty of his books to get a complete story. He's discovered how to avoid the weakness that develops when you have a set of novels set in a fantasy world:some people can't be bothered to buy all the books---they just buy the ones that interest them. By sticking all his novels together, he can make you shlep through all 7,000 pages or so. Great marketing, anyway."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"HAL9000: Well, Babble-Organizing Reader Entertainer RJ-100, we think the experiment is a failure.

I'm a BIG fan of the series, but this book was the worst pot boiler I've ever read. There was virtually no action for the first 2/3 of the book. There were even words omitted. The book was some 700 pages long, and most of it was about the confused state of mind of the characters. There was just enough suspense at the end to make you wonder what would happen next, but then, that's what we thought after Book 9, and we got jack! To my relief, there was no more gratuitous titillation; but there was also no plot - none whatsoever. The story advanced maybe one tiny step. Not what I expected for my money and for my wait.

Of course this could just be a rumor as well but I am hopefully. He did oringinally delay the release of the book because it was so large so perhaps the rumor does have some truth to it.

Jordan is filling pages and pages with pure fluff. Having waited for this book for that entire time, I feel like I just got my chain yanked. Aside from a few major decisions being made, Jordan spends his words describing filthy clothing, and or just TALKING about clothing clean or not, for a great percentage of the book. Lots of describing scenery, and background, but little on plot devlopment and progression. I am very dissappointed with this book and it is starting to color my overall perceptions of the series. I hope he gets back to what he gave us in the first few installments, and I will likely ready whatever he may produce in the WOT in the future, but I won't be anticipating it or holding my breath."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you were to skip this book and move directly on to the next one, you probably wouldn't miss a thing. Why? Because nothing happens. NOTHING HAPPENS. Oh yes, except that we get endlessly detailed descriptions of all the women's clothing. And the men's, for that matter. Maybe if Jordan stopped noting the amount of embroidery on Elayne's dresses and the amount of lace in Mat's cuffs we might get somewhere! Approximately the first 400 pages take place either BEFORE or on the EXACT SAME DAY as Winter's Heart concludes. Yep, that's right folks, four hundred pages of the same day. Apparently the rule of thumb here is to make each book longer with less content.And on another note, why is it that all the women in Jordan's books are domineering, overbearing, and manipulative? I'm all about women's rights and so forth (and I am a woman), but these women so condescending and self-righteous it makes me sick. And they don't get any better here.I love Robert Jordan as much as the next person, and I will probably go on buying his books until the series ends (should that ever happen), but he needs to stop meandering and get on with the story!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After an investment of several hundred dollars in this series, I am in it for the long haul. However, I really find myself questioning the quality of the recent installments in The Wheel of Time. As I think back on how well written, exciting, and moving the first four books were, it is disheartening to think about how fluff-filled and boring the last four books have been. As for the tenth installment, I found myself looking ahead to see whose POV the next section was in because what I was reading was absolutely glacial in pace. The 680 pages could have easily been condensed into a 100 page prologue. I just don't get it. I have ultimate respect for Robert Jordan's talent. I just wish his editor use the red pen a bit more liberally. I genuinely want to know what happens to these characters. I used to recommend this series to everyone by saying, &quot;He makes you care about the characters.&quot; I won't recommend this series to anyone until I see how it all turns out. I'll leave you with this. The first book was published in 1988. If we keep up the current pace of 2 years between books and there are three more books (I can't imagine there being less than three more) the series will be finished in 2009. Twenty-two years.

The plain fact of the matter is that very little happens in the book. There is talk of battles to come, but it never really goes anywhere. Characters stay the same and the points that we have all been noticing for three books go unnoticed by the main characters - i compared Egwenes situation to that of a pantomine &quot;he's behind you&quot;. Mat is written into a situation that has been prophicised that there really is no surprises to be had there. And Rand, the main character is in the book for less than 30 pages out of the entire 650+ volume. Very disapointingAfter the events of the nineth book i had expected it to start on a path that would take us to the final battle. I enjoyed the leed up to the final battle (books 1-9 are my favorite fantasy books) but it seems Mr Jordan is unwilling to take us there just yet. The entire series could do without this book- and i am hoping the wait for the next book won't be long.Please let the next book have some actual story in it instead of the characters continuing the same situation that they found themselves in, in the previous book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been reading this series for years, and it was once upon a time my favourite. However this has changed due to a few things, mainly I've found better authors (Steven Erikson, George R.R. Martin, Robin Hobb), and I'm sick of waiting for the next one only to be disappointed.I thought there was a pick up with Winter's Heart. I really did. There was acutal movement with the chracters, and Rand did something I'd been specualting about for ages, cleansing the source. However has other reviewers have pointed out, this book is mainly about what everyone else was doing whilst this was taking place. I simply cannot work out how Jordan doesn't pick up the pace. I mean his earlier books had it, it was from about book 5 that things slowed down. And many other authors write big novels and manage to do it. So why can't he?? He is milking it out a bit, and I for one am heartily sick of it. It is never going to end.Having complained like this, there were some good points making it worth 3 stars. I actually enjoyed reading most of it, even if I felt this should have been melded to Book 9. Some of it was very entertaining. I enjoyed Mat being back on the scene, his interaction with Tuon was good. I also found myself quite enjoying Egwene scene's which normally I don't. Perrin's were better, but more Rand was needed. I missed the Forsaken. I would have liked a headcount to see who survived the cleansing. Messana's scene was good, added some menace to the series.If you are a fan you will find this enjoyable to read, but finish it feeling bitter. Jordan's writing has improved, this is not as bad as the Path of Daggers. However if you think many plots will be resolved, don't. Nothing really happens, decisions are made yes, but with the way things are nothing will happen for at least 2 or 3 books.

This series has gotten progressively worse after book 5. Crossroads of Twilight dips to new lows. I can't believe Jordan made the world wait two years for this... He makes next to no progress whatsoever in the story! The cast of characters is immense, which adds to this series early greatness, but lets be honest it begins and ends with Rand. How you can write an entire book and only dedicate 2, 2 1/2 chapters to the key character, only AFTER 500+ pages of reading about everyone and their grandmother!

They have all become so paranoid that close friends like Elayne and Egwene are not at all forthcoming with each other. If Rand can use Nynaeve to help cleanse saidin, why can't he be honest and frank with her and with Egwene, et al.? Even more troubling is the perverted view of women expressed in most of the books, but this one especially. They are angry, untrusting, power hungry, and silly. I'll bet other readers too are sick of \\"clutching skirts\\" and \\"adjusting stoles\\" and of \\"sideways glances\\". This book is better edited that the last few but the writing about women lacks nuance and subtlety. I could not be more sick of Aes Sedai power struggles. Please, Mr. Jordan, move on!

A previous reviewer mentioned that the font used in the printing of the WOT books was getting larger. I checked my collection and found that not only had the font increased in size in the last 3 books but that the line spacing had also increased. I calculated that if books 7, 8 and 9 had been printed using the line spacing used in book 6, they would have been 476, 394 and 458 pages long respectively. This doesn't even take into account the larger font, which would make them even shorter when compared to the earlier books. Thus, those readers who have commented on the books after book 6 as being fragments are absolutely right. Books 7,8,9 and 10 would only make up two volumes if the typesetting had been done as it was for the earlier books. So books 7 and 8 are really one book, as are 9 and 10. Viewed in that way they actually are not bad books, but charging full price for half a book is bad. Obviously the effect of the Dark Lord on RJ. I'm afraid he's fallen under the Shadow.

I don't think this will be enought to get me through another novel, however.

It stopped being interesting somewhere around book five, although I've read them all so far - I keep convincing myself that the next book will be the last! And it never is!

The plot moved quickly, it was interesting, the characters well fleshed out. The excellent writing continued for several more books. Mr. Jordan, what happened to you? The last two books are dead in the water. NOTHING, I mean NOTHING interesting happens to the story or the characters! What is the point of writing two entire books which do nothing to advance the plot? Set-up is good and necessary but only the amount of set-up which is relevant and assists the reader. I am extremely disppointed that I just read an entire book in which no plot advancement occurs.

I mean, it's all meant in love, you know...I'm a great fan of this series, but when Bob writes an appalling tenth installment....you have to teeeeelllllll him that, and once enough fans have yelled at him, he can say \\"oooooh, you DON'T like it when the whole book is full of tea parties and emotionally unstable women's rantings?

Like many other reviewers though, I'm disappointed. I have defended RJ from many critics on some of the previous books. Not on this one, though. There is a certain amount of story progression with the White Tower siege and with Mat & Tuon's story, but when I look at where both of those were at the beginning of the book and look at where they're at toward the end, my first reaction was \\"Is that it?\\". It took me longer to read this one than any of the previous ones.What I liked:*Mat is still funny and his interactions with Tuon do provide some comedy.*Logain was interesting in this book*Alviarin's surpriseWhat I didn't like:*small amount of story progression (the people who say there is none at all are being unfair and inaccurate though).*Elayne's chapters are very difficult even when the info is relevant.*Rand, the main character among main characters is hardly even in the book.*Perrin's search for Faile is tedious.In Summary:At best, this is a setup book. The comparison I most often make is that it is identical to Winter's Heart but without the great ending that made Winter's Heart worth it. At no point in this book was I ever really engaged and excited as previous books did. It does however have some small story movement and some interesting events that keep it from being a total loss. Having read the next book Knife of Dreams before finally reviewing this and the other Wheel of Time books, I can say that the excitment returns in that book. For that reason and that reason alone do I recommend anyone read Crossroads of Twilight. In keeping with my reviews of the other books, though, I must rate this book on its own merits though and it's negatives are not completely overcome by the few positives. Therefore, I gave it 2.5 stars and allowed my disappointment to influence me to round down instead of up."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"No need to expand on the other negative reviews that have already been written, this tome took us nowhere fast. If RJ's not careful the WOT series will turn into a Goodkindesque type of literary quagmire where the author keeps milking the same tired storylines without advancing any, at least until the faithful readers finally give up on the whole quest. The question that really needs to be asked now is whether or not RJ can finish what he started and move on to the sequel instead of the prequel?

Even more so with this one as we go back in time and see how everyone reacts to what Rand did with the Source at the end of Book 10! Time is not progressing and neither is the story. No end is in sight, yet I still read because there is little else in the realm of Fanasy books worth reading.I am looking forward to the next Game of Thrones book..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once again, Robert Jordan proves he can develop characters and subplots for 1000 pages, while not actually accomplishing much of anything in the overall story line. This whole book could have been condensed to a couple of chapters in a larger book in which SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS to move the plot along.I don't think I will even buy the next book until some other people read it and tell me if anything actually goes on."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While it is true that \\"nothing much\\" seems to happen on the surface of Book 10, there's a whole lot more going on underneath: a sense of tension, building up to a breaking point. I have to admit I was a bit frustrated with the first half of the book, which takes place over a day--the same day that ends \\"Winter's Heart\\" with Rand fighting the Forsaken. Upon retrospect, however, I had to admit I couldn't think of anything else that Jordan could have done. All in all, his handling of it was very believable and realistic (taking into consideration the healthy amount of suspension of disbelief necessary to read the series in the first place).Because this is one story, as opposed to stand-alone novels that all take place in the same universe, it's best read back-to-back, as if you were reading one huge book.My recommendation is this: if you've read the previous books but it's been a while, reread the entire series before starting here. Having read Books 1-7 in succession six months before Book 8 came out, I hated Book 8, because I felt like its pace was lacking. Therefore, I waited a year to read Book 9 (after it came out, that is). Before doing so, I decided to reread the first 8 books. To my surprise and delight, Book 8 read completely differently the second time around, without there being such a huge lag time between installments.My reason for making it four stars:1) Size. While still a heft novel, the font size is a bit larger than earlier books (compare to \\"A Crown of Swords\\"), which means the book isn't really as thick as it looks.2) Lag time. The first seven books came out in six years (with two in 1993). Since Book 7 was published in 1996, it's taken six years to get three books. Granted, I don't want Jordan to slap together a piece of [junk] just to get it out there, but it is frustrating to wait so long.3) Glossary. There were several characters in this book that I had a hard time remembering from previous books, and I found the glossary to be woefully incomplete here. For the most part, a refrence was made at some point that refreshed my memory, but it was usually closer to the end of the sequence than the beginning, causing some frustration. (This is yet another reason to read the books back-to-back.)4) Price. Again, I don't really blame Jordan for this, but the last two books have been priced at $29.95, close to $5 more than most other hard backs. For this price, it would seem that TOR could provide better binding. I had to sift through a stack of about 10 books to find a spine that wasn't already coming apart or pages that weren't properly glued.5) Cover Art. I'm sick of the covers. Everyone looks like a little kid, giving the series a \\"children's fantasy\\" aspect, which it most definitely is not. Please, TOR, find someone else to do the artwork!Jordan has created an immense world here, and based on some video interviews I've seen, he seems as anxious to get to the end as most of his readers. But he does have the pesky business of cleaning up many, many plot threads before he can do so. I have a feeling that Book 11 will see the plotting pick up speed like a snowball rolling downhill."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is not the strongest book in the Wheel of Time series. That said, it is essential for further plot development in the series. This was the next to last volume written by Jordan alone prior to his demise.

It took too long for me to finish this book. i oculdn't really get into it very much. I'm goin to finish the series, but if the rest of the bookds are like this it is going to be very slow in comeing.

I have read the series twice now from book 1 to book 10. The books flow one into other very nicely.

In seven hundred pages Jordan progressed the development of his series by only a few days!!!! Nothing changed from the end of the last book. No action took place and the main characters actually did not accomplish a single goal. In fact, you would not miss anything by skipping this book altogether and waiting for the next. Given his last several books I would strongly suggest that those desiring to discover the outcome of the series should get each of the final books at the library when they come out, find a nice couch in the facility, and read the last couple of chapters. You will not miss anything whatsover by doing so. In fact, you could skip this book altogehter and read the summary provided by others and you will not miss a thing!!I would give this book zero stars if that was a possible choice.

At the time of my review, this 10th installment (10th, are you kidding? This guy should write for Reader's Digest.) earned two stars after 413 reviews...wow. How can a publishing company willfully continue to print material that engenders such distaste for literature? I truly believe that a boring fantasy author is as close as it gets to no activity in the frontal lobe (unless you're a waning fantasy-author's book cover artist; I have some Crayons, too, may I be an artist?)...it's not history, man! You're not writing a thesis on Peruvian bush weevils.If Jordan's future books get any worse, and it sounds like he's beating a path in that direction, Mass Market Publishing will face the dilemma of supporting a Sominex-writing fantasy author, or risk having his increasingly tenuous fan base dig their eyes out with a bookmark. Neither path seems a very good source of future revenue.Again, I will probably never read one of Jordan's books...but I can't wait for his next attempt in anticipation of the reviews it will get. I'm beside myself with excitement knowing that an uninspired fantasy will not read as good as the people who will eventually critique it.

Comic books never end, their characters rarely grow or change, final resolution never takes place. For those readers out there who enjoy soap operas and comic books equally, then Wheel will satisfy you as nothing else will. You?re not reading these books to find out what ultimately happens?you?re reading it to find out what happened in this issue. You?re reading them only because they?re familiar and safe and they?ll be regularly published for you like clockwork. The only other reason to read these books is if some enterprising publisher published a condensed version of those sections dealing only with Rand. This might be a worthwhile read? assuming that Wheel ever ends, which it shows no signs of doing.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS. If you?ve ever noticed that the thing is eleven volumes long and still growing with no end in sight then you?ve answered this question already. There are better writers in the fantasy genre. Better works of literature in the realm of speculative fiction, and even if you like certain parts of stuff in Wheel, you?re going to be punished for those likes by the unbearable length of the series as a whole. There is every reason not to get involved with this thing. Like living your own life for one. Like not enriching exploitive publishers for another.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For all the annoying things about this book, and with all of the last few Jordan novels, this is really a pretty decent piece, for what it is. What it is, specifically, is a filler novel that catches the reader up with what was happening elsewhere while Winter's Heart was going on. In truth, Jordan should have just made Winter's heart longer and skipped this one entirely, give the guy a break. The real problem here is that if you haven't read the other books recently, it takes a while to remember who everyone is. In previous books this wasn't too big of a deal, but in this one, by the time you figure out who's who, you've jumped to the next set of characters.If you can deal with that though, or if you've read the previous books recently, you'll probably get a modicum of enjoyment out of Crossroads.

I enjoy the sub-plots, and the insights into the minor characters, mostly because it allows us to learn about the main characters from others perspectives who inhabit the same world. That sad, a whole BOOK of these \\"insights\\" is just freaking ridiculous.The first four books were mostly about the main characters, because they hadn't touched the world like they do now, but even in books after the 4th, the \\"insights/sub-plots\\" were kept to at most, 1/3 to 1/2 of the pages of the book. This was good, because it allowed a good segway into other main characters exploits.To say I am extremely disappointed in this book would be a colossal understatement. I managed to grind about halfway through, and then reluctantly started page skimming for a brief overview of what was happening. This, from someone who as re-read the entire series every time a book is released, and sometimes while waiting for the new books -- I reckon that I've read the the first book alone, 15-20 times. The fact that I can re-read these novels multiple times, yet can't even find it in myself to get through a NEW book speaks volumes as to how truly bad this book is, in the scope of the rest of them.I will continue to buy the rest of the series, only because I've spent over a decade of my life reading these books.FYI -- I had a better time reading through the hundreds of one-star reviews of Crossroads of Twilight on amazon.com, than the hundreds of pages in the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan, in his multi-year writer's block, has the gall to charge us for providing us a detailed description of exactly where he left off two novels ago."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been following this series for years and was vastly disappointed with the last few. *This* one however, says nearly nothing for 680 pages.

I understand that there are only so many Forsaken that can be killed off before the series gets dull. However, given the delay in between novels I cannot think of a good reason why every book should not advance the plot.

Instead, unprofessional and short sighted marketing has been practiced. ...I understand that Jordan spoke at a conference a couple of years ago at Trinity College, Dublin. (In Ireland, for those of you who don't know). At this conference he declared that he has no intention of ever bringing this tale to a conclusion. It is the neverending story. Unfortunately, this means that Jordan has to create more and more characters, and add more and more threads to the plot, until it becomes far to complex to follow, and far to turgid, and lacking in pace to bear reading it.This is all the more disappointing when one looks back at the first couple of books of this story. They were excellent, and promised a great storytelling career to come. ...This body of work will be no testament to Jordan's acumen as a writer, ...Readers buy a book because they enjoy a story. A story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. If a book is particularly good, then one has that slightly contradictory feeling of elation and disappointment on finishing reading the last page. Nevertheless, as readers, we all eagerly anticipate the last page. Readers want a conclusion, even if it is only temporary, and in set up of a new story. ...

When the release date came I drove to the nearest book store, purchased it, and started to hungrily read like a starved man put before a feast. It didn't take me long to realize that Jordan had no intention of creating a masterpiece here. This book clearly lacks the adventure and excitement of the first few books in the series. Don't believe me? Read some chapters out of this and then go back to book one. You'll be surprised at the contrast.When this series started out it was hailed as one of the best; ranking right up there with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. After reading this book I wouldn't even try to compare this series to Tolkien's masterpiece.Where do I begin to describe the problems I had with this book? How about I start with the cameo appearance of Rand. That's right. The DRAGON REBORN barely existed in this. The supposed savior of the world that will lead everyone into the last battle hardly made an appearance. Now don't get me wrong, I would love to read about how Elayne is trying to win back the throne and how Perrin is desperately trying to find his loved one; Faile. But the focus of this book is too much on them and Matt's courtship of Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, as well as Egwene's siege of Tar Valon. What was Rand doing during all of this? Apparently nothing worth writing about.Now let's talk about Perrin and his quest to recover Faile. Once I read he had found the Shaido camp I was excited. FINALLY, I thought, we'll get to see some exciting plot that was so common in the beginning of the series. He makes camp, starts to scout out his enemies position and......nothing happens. No attempts are made to rescue her. The reader is left wondering what happens with this subplot; just like the end of book nine. We'll have to wait for another year or two to find out. Oh, the suspense is going to kill me (sarcasm).I could go on about other things that I had issues with but I won't. You should get my point by now. This book lacks the luster and excitement so prevalent in the beginning of the series. Jordan realizes his books are money makers so why should he stop now? The ones that suffer are the readers. And a lot of readers are starting to get upset with him. He has failed to keep the attention of his fans. He gives new meaning to the phrase \\"way off base\\" with the tenth book in the series. The base is being looked for. Where's the base? Sorry Jordan, but you are nowhere near it. It's out of sight and I don't know if you'll be able to find it.This could have been a phenomenal series however the last couple of books have left me wondering if he EVER intends on ending it. Crossroads of Twilight is a mere shadow of this once great fantasy series.

There is no story arc whatsoever - nothing happens. There is no climax. My experience with previous WoT books is that you can read the first 500 pages wondering when the climax will arrive, and it may be the last 50 pages of a huge volume, but it's usually totally worth all of the drudging build-up, character development, extraneous detail and unnecessary complication. I love those things, in a way. It makes the world real, dense, complex. But it was completely unnecessary this late in a series to provide an entire volume that does not move the plot along, that accomplishes ONLY establishing back-story, developing characters and showing the complications. It's as if this tenth instalment is the beginning of a new story. Jordan gives us an introduction, a complication, and rising action, but we have to wait until the next book to get the climax and falling action.Also, without spoiling the end, this was the worst cliff-hanger of all time. Cliff hangers are designed to make us long for more, but it's a delicate balance before the audience is just, well, pissed off. Having a character continuously hint that she is about to do something that will change the world tonight, to end with her getting caught, but still not letting the reader know what that thing is even though the entire scene is in free indirect third person point of view, in which we know ALL of that characters thoughts except for this very important detail, is pissing me off.

I should be able to pick them up as cheap used copies by then. Not that I'm stingy - just that I think price should reflect value.Meanwhile, I have found some other excellent authors who focus more on writing and less on marketing. I thought I would really miss the WOT series, but it turns out that I don't."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Personally, I was hoping that all the reviews weren't true and that everybody was just being hard on RJ. But in the end, I found that I totally agreed with them. All the book was about was absolutely noting!! I found myself skipping through entire chapters trying to get to a part that got somewhere. Therefore, i got through the book in less than three days. And that was reading only a few hours a day. All in all, I'm not quite sure that I am going to waste my money on the next novel or not. I was the first in line to get this book, and I'll probably be last in line to get the next one. I just wish that the last battle would hurry up and get here so that we can find out what happens and it would all be over with!! In the general world of writing, you tie up loose ends and THEN make new ones!! Not make new ones on top of old ones!! A total waste of time!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"O.K. so after 4 books which have alienated most of his fans, news if that Robert Jordan has a new book coming out soon. And its not book 11, its a PREQUEL. Why is he writing a prequel when the series everyone is waiting for him ot finish is not finised?Two reasons come to the mind quickly. 1:He does not know how to tie up the series, just look at the last 4 books. Those books covered as much as the first book did by it selfI heard at one point that the series was suppose to be only seven books at the beginning and over time it has encrease which leads to #2:He has sold out adn is after the money.The answer is probable both, and unfortunetly I still do enjoy his writing so I will read this new book.....when it hits the library, 'casue he will not get another dime from me."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"RJ was never much of a writer to start with, but this is an all-time low, even for him. What is the point of this book? It is all filler--for his bank account. His analogies are either stupid of funny. Take for example this one: \\"it (the news) hit her ear like an awl.\\" How stupid. Did her ear begin to bleed? Geez. I'm too bored witht this \\"book\\" to even go through any of my other complaints. Oh well. Plenty of other reviewers will no doubt take up the slack. I would like to agree with the above reviewer who pointed out that just because so many of us hate this book doesn't mean we should shut up or write or own books. It just means we actually have standards above the 7th grade. We just like to have believable, interesting characters instead of cloned boring ones."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first four books of the series were some of the best I have ever read. Books 5-10, however, demonstrate that Jordan has no idea how to advance the plot. It is so complex even he is lost and there is no end in site. The latest book, Crossroads of Twighlight, is simply one of the slowest, most boring reads I have ever endured. What he descibes in 5 pages takes most good writers a paragraph. Some people may label this as &quot;vivid&quot; or building a &quot;rich world&quot; but to me, Jordan is giving us page-filler with no true, significant substance. In all honesty, I wish I could stop reading the series but, like an addict, I can't quit. I have invested more time to this series than I ever did to my studies in school. However, if I have to endure too may more chapters filled with descriptions of the &quot;stout Two Rivers Wool&quot; Nynaeve wears in Telarhanriod, I may just throw in the towell. There is one chapter in the book, approxiumately 20 pages in length, that describes Matt's decision to move Luca's circus away from Illian. That was it, nothing else of importance - 20 pages. Unbelieveable! If Jordan is as good as everyone says he is then he will finish this series in 2 books. My recomendation: Dont read this book until he finishes the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You can skip this book and read Book 11 when it comes out.

It became obvious to me at the rate and complexity of what he was attempting, it would take at least 15 books. So I refuse to read another. One day, when the end is finally reached, (i'm thinkin I might me 40 by then IF I am still alive) I will go out and buy all the books in the series and put aside two weeks or so to read them. im sure it will be enjoyable. But in the meantime, I refused to be toyed with. I just hope he doesn't end up string us along like Steven King and the Gunslinger series. King started that in the 70's and just now finished.

Comic books never end, their characters rarely grow or change, final resolution never takes place. For those readers out there who enjoy soap operas and comic books equally, then Wheel will satisfy you as nothing else will. You?re not reading these books to find out what ultimately happens?you?re reading it to find out what happened in this issue. You?re reading them only because they?re familiar and safe and they?ll be regularly published for you like clockwork. The only other reason to read these books is if some enterprising publisher published a condensed version of those sections dealing only with Rand. This might be a worthwhile read? assuming that Wheel ever ends, which it shows no signs of doing.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS. If you?ve ever noticed that the thing is eleven volumes long and still growing with no end in sight then you?ve answered this question already. There are better writers in the fantasy genre. Better works of literature in the realm of speculative fiction, and even if you like certain parts of stuff in Wheel, you?re going to be punished for those likes by the unbearable length of the series as a whole. There is every reason not to get involved with this thing. Like living your own life for one. Like not enriching exploitive publishers for another.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After nine books I was hopeful that at least one plot line would be resolved.

This is true. But these last four books are also suffering from an egregious amount of PADDING, padding that has nothing to do with setting up a plot.For example, when the Aes Sedai meet, it takes them 4... pages just to sit down. Four long boring pages?! Is this necessary?This book is just chock full of useless details that have been repeated ad nauseum since Crown of Swords. If you want to hear about Aes Sedai breast size to the most pedantic minutae, or if Nynaeve yanking her braid ten times in five pages fascinates you, or you want to read about Egwene crossing her arms beneath her breasts, or any number of oft-repeated and useless details, then by all means, read this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"800 pages with no real plot advancement.

Auden, in his review of The Fellowship of The Ring on October 31, 1954, in The New York Times Book Review, stated, \\" No fiction I have read in the last five years has given me more joy than The Fellowship Of The Ring.\\" That feeling was shared by many readers over the first four volumes of The Wheel Of Time series by Robert Jordan. As is evident by most readers comments, that feeling has turned to sadness and/or disgust by book 10, by which time it has become clearly evident that the desire to have a mediocre, but very profitable, enterprise, rather than a superior fantasy series, was the chosen course of the author. This choice has been met in reader's comments with great venom as each new volume proves the point. It is only a great love for the earlier books that brings forth such venom in being let down in the later series. To be fair to the writer, however, though forging interesting characters, his writing, particularly as to the difference in the sexes, has been pedestrian, at best, and often embarrassing, and his books will never be seriously reviewed, or be the subject of awards. They are, without doubt, serious moneymakers, as Crossroads opened as number one on the national bestseller list, and sells impressively to fans as they wait for new action. Jordan must be given credit for having taken an enjoyable series, which had a remarkably impressive start, and draining every last dollar from the book buying public with a seemingly interminable series, moving at a glacier pace, and which will undoubtedly continue as long as the market will allow. It was wise of him not to use his real name on these books. Simply do not support this level of writing, do not buy the book, and do not support this kind of poor effort. Follow the story to the end if it ever comes by going to the library. For well-written fantasy, read R.R. Martin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the first three books and then waited with baited breath for each new installment. Unfortunately each installment now takes longer and is more disappointing than the previous one. Crossroads of Twilight is thin on plot and thick on the filling. Robert Jordan appears to be stretching the story out to breaking point, probably in anticipation of the royalties from each book. Unfortunately it seems the less substance he puts into each book the more fans fall by the way side. I would borrow this book or buy it second hand because it is certainly not worth spending your hard earned money on. Lets hope Jordan learns the error of his ways and starts displaying the brilliance that had us all enthralled at the beginning of this epic."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a bone-grinding halt to such an exciting (all beit falling off) series. Reading this book was like watching a soap opera. Plenty of detail and filler, but when you're done with it, you realize there was absolutely zero plot movement in the entire book.Can't believe Jordan can write 680 pages of material and describe nothing of consequence. I had read more than half the book until I got an update on the main character. Then guess what happened with him... That's right. Nothing. This series is quickly going from the best I've encountered to the most disappointing.Next time TOR and Jordan will have to earn my money with a few good customer reviews before I buy.

Lewis and Green divide their program for thinking better up into 5 Steps:1. Thinking Better by Thinking Clearly2. Thinking Better about Intelligence Tests3. Thinking Better About Learning4. Thinking Better About Solving Problems5. Thinking Better About Decision MakingI first read the book years ago and now, looking back at it, I'm surprised to discover how many of the techniques of this book I've integrated into my own life. I've also some parts of it with my students and own children. Lewis and Green state that by using the methods presented in this book, their students have reported the following achievements: acquiring new skills to get ahead in their career; solving problems and making decisions more efficiently; understanding their children's school assignments better; returning to education as full-time students; and taking up mentally rewarding leisure activities.My assessment is that while all of the chapters are very useful, the one most likely to be helpful is Step Three about Thinking Better About Learning. In this chapter, Lewis and Green reveal some powerful study techniques for memorizing material better. If you're in school, then you would definitely benefit from this chapter! The authors also provide some very good practical advice and powerful tools in their chapters on decision-making and on problem solving. The introductory chapter is very good, although I wish they'd provided more information on peak experiences and flow, the emotional component of memory (they do return to this theme later in the book), and personal thinking style.This would have been a 5-star book if they had provided more information on some of the other topics and less on the chapter on Intelligence Tests (almost 100 of the book's 300 pages are devoted to this topic alone).In spite of the books limitations, if you come across a copy of this book, I would definitely consider buying it. It's a book that will help you do just what it claims it will help you to do."},{"Title":"Thinking better","review":"I haven't done much reading in the area of thinking. This book has in fact sparked my interest there and I plan to read more in the area. The second half of this book has a tun of insight from research that is from the 70's. It's interesting though how the research about learning/thinking doesn't seem to have progressed to far to make this book seem dated. It seems cutting edge still. All I know is that I learned some extremely valuable items from this book and I want to continue down the path some more. More importantly, my desire to learn in other areas has also been inflamed.I have given this four stars because the first 150 pages is just about doing well on IQ tests and only has one relevant item that is applicable to everyday life. Forget the first half, just read the second."},{"Title":"Thinking better","review":"This book is a delightful consumer ready program for improved cognitive function. Though the book is from some time ago and it shows its age with the emphasis on IQ tests which had reached their peak more than a decade ago which most psychologists now devalue including &#8220;A History of Modern Psychology&#8221; by C. James Goodwin. Tangentially, I argue he also minimizes personality tests essentially suggesting for industry to proceed with caution.The book does make very good use of its pages in that many large ideas and tools are introduced. It is highly suggested that the reader at least have a high school education and be serious in applying the tools today and building on them tomorrow. The first two &#8220;Steps&#8221; are mostly motivation. The real gems are in the remaining portions. But don&#8217;t expect that by skipping any page you are doing yourself a favor. The concepts and application can be difficult and context by which these programs are used are illuminated in the early parts of the bookI found the book highly useful and I was already &#8220;smart.&#8221; What I&#8217;ve found is that by universally applying these techniques I have significantly reduced my anxiety and metal strain. Others might begin understanding new concepts or realizing how they have made the same large thematic errors for years. The people to whom I have recommended the book have had varying interest but all agree that good material is contained in text and that it has been worth it.Finally, I suggest that more people begin taking a look at the activities they are doing every day. It is the activities that we do most often that are the most difficult to scrutinize and yet there too is where we should be focusing our efforts for maintaining oneself, specifically: food & water, air, posture, leisure activities/vices.

Ouida, as she called her literary alter-ego, obviously traveled in the Low Countries, for she is conversant with both the Flemish people (city life, country life, general customs) and the foibles of human nature. The tale is frankly sentimental; one wonders if she is making a plea for social reform or communal conscience. I suspect that this story was not well received abroad; the city of Antwerp and the selfish villagers come off quite badly as a result of their shallow attitudes and callous indifference to povery, pain and hunger.A dog is elevated to having almost human feelings, while an innocent youth is rewarded for his simple faith--only after death. Too late for Society to make amends; all they can do is grant the pair a single grave. Few teens of the 90's would appreciate this syrupy tale of Patrasche's devotion and Nello's artistic apotheosis. Still the book may strike a responsive chord in the hearts of sensitive readers of all ages. A good read-aloud story for bedtime. This emotional tragedy highlights the art of the Baroque master, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640). This Dover PB edition contains the original pen and ink sketches, which greatly enhance the story and our ability to &quot;see&quot; the characters."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders","review":"I read A Dog of Flanders by Ouida mainly out of curiosity. I wanted to read the first &quot;boy and his dog&quot; book written for children. I didn't expect much, and I was surprised when I began to enjoy the story late in the book.The story is of a peasant boy, Nello, and his dog, Patrasche. The boy just wants to be an artist and see a painting by Rubens. The dog (who has very human feelings) just wants to help the boy reach his goal. The two face absolutely every hardship possible in their attempts.To enjoy this story, you have to take it in the context of the time it was written. The book is really, really sentimental. Every play for emotion possible is made by the author. Early in the book, it even says (in a literal tone) that Nello and his grandfather would just lay down and die if anything ever happened to the dog. Patrasche was their &quot;alpha and omega.&quot; All of the sentimentality really bothered me at the beginning. I'm used to modern writing and didn't take the overplay of emotion well. I had to take into account, though, that Ouida wrote in the romantic tradition, when this type of writing was common, especially in children's books. Looking at A Dog of Flanders as an example from the time period helped me to enjoy the novel even through its oversentimentality. Overall, A Dog of Flanders is a pretty decent read. Most children of today wouldn't love it. A Dog of Flanders is definately a worthy read as a curiosity piece, though."},{"Title":"A dog of Flanders","review":"\`A Dog of Flanders: A Christmas Story\` is a young adult book written by the Victorian English author Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e (aka \\"Ouida\\"). It's a sentimental animal fable, part of her lifelong campaign to draw attention to the problem of cruelty to dogs. It's set in Flanders where dogs are routinely worked to death. The hero of the story, a peasant boy named Nello, saves an old dog Patrsche from such a fate. When Nello falls impossibly in love outside his class with the millers daughter, Alois, his heart is broken when she is denied to him by her cruel father.I found the story pleasant and emotionally moving. It can be overly sentimental in that Victorian way, and has some Romantic Nationalism, but the story is good and leaves one with a positive feeling in the end. Although Ouida wrote over 40 novels and was very popular in her time, she is hardly read anymore, this childrens books appears now to be the most popular of her works. But in her time her most famous work wasUnder Two Flags(1867), which was still being published and read in the 20th century, including 4 different movie adaptations. Likewise \`A Dog of Flanders\` seems to have inspired at least 7 movies, as recently as 1999.

His mother was very old or Johan was very old when he got his daughter. Nello died when he was 15 but animation was much younger. The problem I see is 15 years old boy is old enough to live by himself 100 years ago ( I might be wrong). Anyway setting of age is kinda wrong.

I originally read this book as a library loan and enjoyed it so much that I bought it to keep in my collection. Excellent work. I would have graded this more at 4 stars, but felt 5 was deserved in order to balance out the over-all rating of the book here."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Meade paints Keaton as a pitiful man and never seems to get at the heart of his passion for the cinema. The only emotion I felt towards Keaton, one of my personal heroes, after reading this book was pity. I don't recommend it for anyone who has never previously read anything about the Great Stoneface."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Seems odd to write a book about someone of whom the author does not seem a fan. Not only is the tone entirely loathesome, it is riddled with fabrications and loosely based hear-say. Not only was it poorly researched, it seems as though in many areas the facts were blatantly overlooked, omitted. The author quickly loses credibility with anyone who has access to verifiable facts about Buster Keaton's life.This book was a peculiar waste of time and energy for the author, and more-so for any potential reader.The beautifully done (and seperately researched) discography is the only reason this book received two stars from me. (Borrowing it from the library will clear one's conscience, if one needs access to the thorough discography.)"},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"I was actually surprised to find myself enjoying this one better than I expected to. Meade's tactic of laying some pretty heavy charges against dead people leaves something to be desired though. The dead can't defend themselves (and neither can their dead friends set the record straight, unfortunately) and while I'm sure there's something satisfying in claiming that Keaton's unswerving loyalty to his father, his mentor (Schenck) or his hero (Arbuckle) was the result of drunken beatings he suffered as a child, it all falls apart messily when Meade (who started to remind me a little of that other pop-psychologist Lucy Van Pelt) tries to insinuate that as a result, Keaton shuffled through life wearing a downbeaten expression because he was an emotional cripple. All you have to do is watch his films to put the lie to that bit of nonsense. The mirth is evident in his eyes in more scenes than I care to recount.Still in all, I give Meade some major points for the sheer volume of fascinating Three Keatons Vaudeville era information, for laying out the social landscape of early Hollywood so effectively, and for filling in the gaps in my own knowledge of Keaton's life after MGM. And the recipes at the end are a nice touch, too.I only wish she'd been able to finally name the actor who plays the barber in Steamboat Bill Jr."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Oh, man. Where to start. Someone should write a book about how wrong and terrible this book is.Meade is obviously trying to use the &#34;sad clown defense&#34; as her thesis. Maybe she thinks it sells copies. (She might be right, but she's supposed to be a Documentarist, really.) She vilifies everyone in Buster Keaton's life and makes them all seem like one-dimensional, mustache-twirling, cape-and-top-hat-wearing characters who made Buster's life a living hell. It. Is. Simply. Not. True.I went into this knowing that other Keaton (and non-Keaton) fans utterly despise this book, but I thought I would read it anyway. It is cited in many books, so I thought that there must be SOME truth in this book.I was wrong.She got Buster Keaton's name right. That's about all.There should be a Literary Jail for people like Marion Meade. Writing lies and presenting them as &#34;truth&#34; should rate a life sentence. Especially in this case, where she only serves to turn people off Buster - and he really was a nice, gentle man who spent his life making people laugh.The saddest part about this book's existence is that people will read these horrendous lies and think they are true - and future Biographers will continue to spread the lies.You have been warned."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase. I felt personally offended at some of the tripe that is passed off as fact about Buster in this title. There are lots of great books out there about Keaton, and this is definitely not a great book."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"this book seems pretty thoroughly researched and the author seems like an intelligent person... the writing is not very good, though, and the tone is kind of cold throughout... overall, a good read, though, with a great deal of information... the lobster recipe is really tasty too..."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Meade's book does a good job of filling in the details of Keaton's off-screen life. Most valuable are her reference points made to Keaton's films that allows the reader to make correlations/speculations between reoccuring themes found in Keaton's private and performing life. Meade's writing is a little flat at times but she nonetheless does a good job at filling in the details (from the Keaton family and associates p.o.v.).Her sequencing and division of events, including asides regarding various family members, are well thought out and the photo-illustrations are excellent. Overall the quality of the book make it a valuable read to the avid or casual fan as well as to those interested in further research and study."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Marion Meade's definitive (so far) biography of Buster Keaton is meticulously researched and footnoted, and vivid in describing Keaton's character and personal life. Her evocation of his rough and tumble childhood in vaudeville, unparalleled cinematic innovation in the silent era and rediscovery in his later years is fresh and fascinating. Keaton had complete creative control for 19 short films and 10 features in the 1920s; work as intensely original as that of any other cinema artist of any era. No book can convey the laughter and exhilaration of watching Keaton's films, but Meade's book is an invaluable companion to them."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"I wish somebody had told me that I was supposed to hate this book before I read it.When I was a college boy (and that was some time ago) I got a job at as a librarian in my school's film library. There I came across Keaton's films and I've been a fan ever since. I read this bio and liked him all the more for what I read here. I don't think this book presents him as anything other than a genius who took some hard knocks and still managed to make some of the funniest films of all time. I'm no scholar, so I couldn't say whether or not this book contains any factual errors. But I can say that I read it as a fan of the man's work and it didn't strike me as a hatchet job, an attack, or an effort to diminish what he's done.I'd like to join me voice to the tut-tut chorus if True Keaton Fans(TM), but I'm afraid that I all I can honestly say was that this book made me more interested in and more impressed by one of America's most important filmmakers."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"I have read 4 books on Keaton and this on is the best. I liked it because it's starts with his father and his vaudville days. A complete look at Keaton's life on screen and off. Pulls no punches, loaded with funny stories and you'll leave this book amazed at what he did. Very good!"},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"On the positive side, this book talks about the lean years in Buster's life, including his second marriage, that are pretty much ignored in other books on Keaton. It offers a complete filmography at the end, and talks about what has happened to Buster's extended family in the years since his death. On the negative side, the author jumps to conclusions or offers her own opinions about what happened as facts. Like everyone else, I vehemently disagree with the functional illiteracy accusation. Did Buster lack formal education? absolutely. Was he illiterate? absolutely not, based on jobs he had at MGM that involved working on scripts and his own diary which prove otherwise. Buster was interested in his craft and had no use for going over contracts and legal issues with a fine-toothed comb, a character trait that was part of his undoing for sure, but not proof he couldn't have read them had he been interested.The specific errors that the author makes include her claiming that by the late 50's Buster didn't even remember who Dorothy Sebastian was - part of her portrait of Buster as an emotional cripple. However, about the same time, Buster wrote, along with a ghost-author \\"My Wonderful World of Slapstick\\" in which he talks about the dilemma he was in when he met his third wife Eleanor while already involved with a woman with which he had an off-and-on relationship for the previous ten years, and how he wanted to break it off with this woman to pursue Eleanor without hurting the woman's feelings. He is obviously talking about Dorothy Sebastian here, but he comes from an era in which he doesn't want to \\"kiss and tell\\" and omits her name from the book. There are other erroneous conclusions in which the author totally misinterprets certain magazine articles to claim Buster is actually complaining about this or that. The point is, take this book with a grain of salt. Entertaining it is, entirely accurate it is not.From reading this book - and others for that matter - the person who comes across as a total mystery to me is Natalie Talmadge - Keaton's first wife. Here again, the author adds her own conclusions about Natalie's attitudes that I can't see Natalie ever conveying to anyone who would have revealed them, but the following facts are inescapible:a. Natalie spent a huge percentage of Buster's money on clothes she never wore and homes Buster really couldn't afford.b. Natalie ceased sexual relations with Buster after the birth of their second child.c. The effect of (a) was that Buster HAD to sign the contract with MGM in order to keep the money pouring in after his own studio closed.d. The effect of (b) was that Buster looked elsewhere for female companionship.e. The effect of (c) was that Buster became an alcoholic when he no longer had any creative control over his films and was reduced to a performer in movies he largely held in contempt.f. Natalie ultimately divorced Keaton because of (d) and (e) and was seethingly angry with him for the rest of her natural life, when in fact her own actions ( (a) and (b) ) contributed to the whole cycle in the first place.In spite of this obvious chain of events, Keaton never spoke evil of his first wife, a fact that even the author of this book admits. That truly makes him a class act in my book."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"...the most annoying perhaps eing the myth that Buster Keaton was illiterate. True he was not educated, but to say he was illiterate is false. I've seen photocopies of his journal he kept during WWI, and it's clear he studied his Army manuals and learned Morse code and practiced it. The author also makes the mistake of relaying to us conversations that took place between Buster and his mother-in-law, both deceased of course. How would she know what was said? These were about things Buster would have discussed with no one else. It's an intro to people unfamiliar with Buster, but by no means accurate. She could have skipped the hearsay about his early life &quot;with women&quot; as that is unfounded too."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Why did Ms. Meade write a book about someone whom she clearly dislikes?More importantly, why did she write such a poorly researched book?AS soon as I read that Keaton was 'illiterate' I knew that this book was not a keeper.(Buster Keaton kept a diary when he was seven years old, and wrote screenplays when he was an adult. Any biographer can check this out.)And any reader can purchase a much, much better biography of Buster Keaton. THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T LIE DOWN or KEATON are both superior to this one."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"It's really a shame that Keaton's 100th birthday was marked by the publication of a book that tries so hard to shoehorn him into the stereotypical Sad Clown mold...Ms. Meade does her best to portray him as a dysfunctional, unhappy, frozen, remote, illiterate wretch, when in fact he was none of those things. The illiteracy allegation is particularly foolish--how could a supposedly meticulous researcher have overlooked the existence of Buster's own (very tidy) diary? Watch the Brownlow/Gill documentary &quot;A Hard Act to Follow&quot;, or dig up a used copy of the Blesh biography, but for heaven's sake don't let this dreadfully misguided piece of manufactured pathos be your only impression of Buster!"},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"This book is tripe, frankly. It boringly repeats a number of glaring mistakes from earlier efforts (the abused child myth to the nth degree, that alcohol and poor box office lost Keaton his independent status, that he was incapable of smiling, and so forth), and then augments these with the ridiculous assertion that Keaton was functionally illiterate. Pure nonsense! Instead of really contacting the people who know/knew Buster the best and following the leads that they could have supplied to the true story, she followed some half-baked psychological analyses, rumors, insouciant third-hand gossip and those earlier sources to arrive at a thoroughly faulty picture of the talented, humble, resilient and, on average, ultimately happy comic. Buster's real story was already available and fundamentally open to any serious author who asked for it at the time of this writing; why Meade chose to write such a miserable piece of trash is beyond me. Was she motivated by sensationalism? Does she look for the sinister in every shining story, no matter how foolish, and batter her readers with it? Who knows...There are no great biographies of Keaton to date, although there are hopes that this may change in the not too distant future. The good information is certainly there. For a far better, if still somewhat faulty assay of his life, see the video \\"Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow\\" by Brownlow and Gill on HBO Home Video, reportedly soon to be released on DVD (Summer 2006). Don't waste your time on Meade, unless you want to read a sorry tome of blatantly false assertions and despicable fiction."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Biographer Meade attempts to create controversy out of a non-controversial figure. Most laughable is Meade's claims concerning Keaton's illiteracy, in light of Keaton being paid as a writer at MGM during a 14 year period (1938-1952). A pity Meade's book couldn't be given a lower rating."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"This is a very detailed biography of Keaton. I don't put faith in non-fiction books that don't include bibliographies and footnotes and Meade's book has 41 pages of those so obviously she has done her research. She cites much of the info contained in the book, however, Meade makes several (almost slanderous)detailed statements about Keaton, then doesn't back them up in the notes. What really pissed me off was Meade wrongly using a known fact to exaggerate the \\"abuse\\" from his father. On page 37 she wrote how Joe Keaton \\"abused\\" Buster on the stage and 1935 X-Rays revealed cracked vertabrae to prove it then on page 145-146 she mentions the exact same 1935 X-Rays revealing the cracked vertabrae when telling the story of the stunt that went wrong that broke his neck while filming a movie years earlier. I found Meade to be somewhat of a drama queen because she exaggerates a lot of things too numerous to count. All throughout the book Meade states Keaton lied in his autobiography. I don't think he lied-he just didn't give details about some of the stories leaving me with many questions. The reason why I got Meade's book in the first place was to try and fill in the gaps. According to her notes, Keaton's widow and his children helped Meade in her research but I would like to think that reading the finished product left them very unhappy. Meade does go out of her way to show Keaton in an unflattering light. I too was very irritated by her insisting Keaton was illiterate. Since he had only 1 day of school I'm sure he didn't read or write very well but he obviously learned enough through the years to get by in life. I have read the other reviews regarding this book and I agree with them. I don't recommend anyone buy this book but if you want to read it check it out from your local library like I did and save your money."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"Fascinating to read if you enjoy reading celebrity tabloids, i.e., lots of dirt, unfounded rumors and outright untruths misrepresented as a biography. (Some nice photos, though.) Biggest lie is that Keaton was illiterate, which is absolutely absurd. A much more acurate picture of Buster's life can be obtained from his own autobiography which is the truth, at least as Buster himself experienced it. The 3-tape video &quot;Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow&quot; is also recommended by this reviewer as well as the documentary of the making of &quot;The Railrodder&quot; titled &quot;The Life and Times of Buster Keaton.&quot; Yes, Buster did some self-destructive things in his life, but they are far outnumbered by the gifts and talent which he made extraordinary use of during at least 65 of his 70 years of life."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"This is not an ideal book for sensitive Buster fans who feel over-protective of him and cannot tolerate criticism of the darker side of his personal life. The book is at times an offensive target into that, and does not always paint him as flattering. Marion Meade does not hesitate to label Buster as somebody with vanity, and likes to use the term &quot;extreme egotism&quot; to describe him. It may be that Meade has drawn on this conclusion because as a child, Buster was the center of attention at all times, as a result of becoming a vaudeville star at about the age of 5, and with this, he was the main breadwinner in the family, therefore, the center of attention which may have grown into extreme egotism. Meade also states that Buster was illiterate. Buster may have been unschooled because of his traveling vaudeville show, but he wasn't illiterate. I've seen his penmanship, both handwriting and printing. Also, he was able to read the part of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; when he was 11 years old (another family-breadwinner situation).But other sources I've read and seen have proven that Buster's behavior was as a modest level-headed guy, a miracle to occur in the world of show business. During his successful years, he did not hesitate to loan money to leeches, rarely getting paid back. He also financially supported his entire family, siblings and all, even after they were well past adulthood.However, because I thrive on Hollywood trash, I recommend this book to anyone interested in old Hollywood gossip because it's a page-turner. It's dense with information. It does not skip any part of his 70-year life, which previously written books have done. Meade gives us a lot of background information on the people in his life. Buster was married 3 times, and it's hard to find information in other books about his 2nd wife, Mae. This one gives us her full background, and also what became of her after the marriage ended in 1935. Two periods in Buster's life that are skimmed over in other books that he'd cooperated in the making of are his MGM years (1928-33) and the drinking problem years with Mae (1933-36), probably because they were too painful to talk about. In &quot;Cut to the Chase&quot;, we get full explanation of those years."},{"Title":"Buster Keaton: Cut To The Chase","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers here that Meade goes out on some rather strange limbs and some of her conclusions don't add up and lack logic and common sense. If, according to her, Keaton was abused since childhood, something that kills your self-worth, I can't see him becoming an egoist. As for the eternal chestnut ... was Keaton abused, I believe, not as a child. Once again, common sense has to reign and the fact that Keaton, when he was young, was constantly examined for bruises and such,anything would have been seen. I think, which a lot of evidence proves, that it happened in his teens when the Gerry Society wasn't monitoring the Keatons. Proof of this comes first from the reviews of the time. Earlier reviews, while they admit the act is a bit strange, basically liked it, later, they start to see fraying at the edges and a darker tone. The second comes from common sense, if Joe Sr was an alcoholic and had a violent temper, the act would have been quite an incendiary situation and makes about as much sense as letting an alcoholic run a taxi service; sooner or later something bad is going to happen. What is little discussed is how much courage it took Keaton to end the act. Keaton was an extremelt responsible person, especially for his age and to end the act must have left him conflicted; between ending the main financial support for his whole family and the knowledge that at sometime his luck was going to run out onstage with his father. Plus, and Keaton was too smart not to know this, the act had a definite shelf-life. While Keaton still looked young, the act had a chance, but would people come to see a 30-ish or 40-ish guy fighting his 50-60-ish father? I think not.As for the \\"stone face\\" during his teens, first, that seems to be a requirement of any adolescent; but more to the point, if Keaton did look that way, for me the most logical assumption was that he was burnt out and bored. He had been doing the same act since he was 5 and for someone with such an agile and creative mind, it must have got pretty stifling,yet, he couldn't end what was the family's sole source of income. That's quite alot for someone in their teens.As for Keaton's illiteracy, even if she hadn't seen any of Keaton's date books, the simple fact is that in the Army he was a cryptographer, something that calls for a high literacy and intelligence. Also, during WWI, IQ tests were given and would determine what job you'd do. If Keaton couldn't even read the test, how could he have done so well as to be a cryptographer?Finally, as for Keaton's desire \\"to live as a Prince\\" just the facts of his life show different. Yes, I'm sure the first time he went with Arbuckle to Joseph Schenk's house in Baydside, he must have been dazzled, but he was much too \\"modest and level-headed\\" as one other reviewer described him not to take it all with a grain of salt. When Keaton was young and single, he lived modestly. When he designed the perfect home for his family, it was deemed too modest by Natalie and when he was on his own again, he once again lived modestly. The most logical assumption is that the trajectory of opulence that was his existence in the 20's was not Keaton's idea. Something that seems to be well substantiated.I don't know if Meade was afraid to sound too glowing so she very often will praise Keaton, then berate him. The book isn't horrible, it does have some merits but it's just not great. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a \\"break out\\" must read biography of Keaton (yet) but hopefully someone may be inspired to do so."},{"Title":"Let's Go Paris (Lets Go City Guides)","review":"I've made &#62;20 visits to France all together.

It covered all topics, from the civil rights movement to Iran-Contra, thoroughly and provided many supporting details. While concentrating on the high profile movements such as civil rights, the women's movement, and later the New Right, the author also traces Hispanic and American Indian movements and briefly touches on the Gay Rights Movement.

Truly believable and enjoyable given the adventures of our new century which is deeply involved in science and vast new knowledge. Believable and lovable characters glorify a man whose frustration we can all relate to and a woman who searches for his glory. Looking forward to Mr. Gilson's further work."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"In his debut novel, Crazy for Cornelia, Chris Gilson takes us to the streets of New York, America's city in rennissance, and packs his pages full of romance and wit. A quirky love affair in an age-old, fairy tale style, Crazy for Cornelia keeps you hooked and leaves you feeling warmer than a mink our heroine might dorn. Truly an auspicious start for author Chris Gilson."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Don't tell a book by its cover. This book has action, sci fi, a really good story and some very clever scenes. I would never have picked it up, though, if my girlfriend hadn't suggested I read it because the cover doesn't show that to me. My girlfriend wanted me to read it for the romantic angle, which is cool, but don't get the idea this is some romance novel. That sells it short. This story involves a theory of Tesla science and electricity, a devious plot and a lot more. I think almost anyone would enjoy it. Its a good read."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I write book reviews for my local library and was asked to do one for this book. Well, I told the library that they wasted their money when they purchased it and declined to write a review.I usually spend a lot of time on my reviews, sometimes analyzing characters,discussing the author's writing style and so on, but this time it is not worth my effort.This book was just plain ridiculous---bad enough that one of the wealthiest debutantes in New York would fall for her doorman but when you throw in an obsession with Nikola Tesla and the neon artwork of a tortured saint, it goes beyond ludicrous and enters the realm of preposterous.I would not even recommend taking this book out of the library. I would not have gone beyond page 50 had I not been asked to read it."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"On the positive side, it was a cute story and it did hold my interest--always a kind of threshold test for any novel. In addition, I felt that the doorman's perspective on life and the material on Tesla were interesting as well. However, I did have 3 complaints with the story, which are as follows:First, it was very predictable. The author lets you know loudly and clearly where the story is headed as far as Kevin and Cornelia are concerned, right from the first chapters, and then he heads inexorably towards that destination. Thus, while there were a few little surprises along the way, I felt that there was basically no sense of suspense as far as the &quot;big picture&quot; was concerned. I knew exactly how the story would end, and I'm sure others did as well. That for me was a problem. A book is always better when readers ask themselves: &quot;I wonder how this story will end?&quot; That could not be said of this book.Second, I felt that many--though not all--of the characters were somewhat one-dimensional stick figures without any sense of nuance to their personality. In particular, I am thinking of Tucker Fisk and Chester Lord. The author has given them each a dominant character trait, and they never seem to veer from those traits.Finally, it just seemed to me that this kind of story has been told so many times before (and maybe that's why I thought the story was predictable). You know the type--a girl (or sometimes a guy) in the upper echelons of society falls hard for a guy (or girl) well below her &quot;rank and station&quot; (as Gilbert and Sullivan might have put it), often in preference over a person who is seemingly her equal in terms of societal status.So while I certainly would not say the book is terrible by any means, I just didn't see it as the 5-star masterpiece which most others have found it to be."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Found the book very entertaining, always had me yearning for Corny's next crazy adventure. A nice blend of romance, comedy and tragedy. The author brings the chatacters to life. The author's style of writing truly makes you visualize the scenes as if you were watching a movie- maybe it is the connection I have to NYC. I find myself looking for Kevin Doyle in every doorway!"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"This was truly a rollicking good read, I loved every minute, as they say ,&quot;a real page turner\\". A glimpse into the rarefied world of Park Ave, some wonderful scenes of NY and an adventurous Boy meets Girl love story. Reminded me of Tim Robbins, Even Cowgirls get the Blues. Not all fluff and fun, this is a truly insightful writer with some very poignant things to say and a wonderful way with words. A great book, I'm waiting for the next."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"A wonderful story that truly triggers your imagination and makes you believe that true love conquers all."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Kevin Doyle worked as a doorman at one of the richest Fifth Avenue co-ops. He was also an artist. His art was created using neon lights. He made Saint Sebastian but could not seem to make it glow as he would like. As a doorman, he learned to identify the tenants and important people. Chester Lord IV and his daughter, Cornelia, were the most entertaining. Cornelia was always in the tabloids and publicized as a wild, debutante partygoer. However, brief meetings with her made Kevin wonder how much of that was true.Cornelia Lord was determined that the world would know about Nikola Tesla. She had quietly made a museum for him and was searching for towers he may have created in South America. She and Kevin come together by chance. All would have been fine except for Tucker.Tucker Fisk was Chester Lord's right hand man. He had a fool-proof plan of marrying Cornelia before her twenty-first birthday, and cheating the Lords out of all their money. Nothing could go wrong. He had covered all possible angles ... except the one of a love struck doorman interfering.**** Here is a delightful story to make any boring day fly by quickly. It did not take long for the story to grab my attention. The more I read, the more outrageous the story became! Kevin even conned his way into a mental hospital to help Cornelia! I enjoyed every minute of reading it! Recommended! ****"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"If you still believe in fairy tales, you'll enjoy this 90's version of Cinderella.Cornelia Lord, rich beyond belief, is trapped in a life of New York parties and debuts that don't suit her and leave her empty. The persona she shows to an eager publicity-hungry public is quite different than the one she uses in her work at the Nikola Tesla Museum she's helping to organize. After the loss of Cornelia's mother, she and her father, the venerable Chester Lord, become strangers living under the same plush roof.To fill the void left by his wife, Chester worries about making more money and saving his company from a hostile takeover. To ease her pain, Cornelia pulls stunts like splashing around in the fountain at the Plaza and has gained the nickname &quot;Corny the Crazy Deb.&quot; Her life is rich fodder for the tabloids.Our modern-day Cinderella story is gender-blind. Instead of a wicked queen, this fairy tale's villian comes in the form of Tucker Fisk, a partner in Chester's firm and a suitor for Cornelia's hand (and money). While seemingly attentive and mindful of the high-strung Cornelia's needs, he is actually more interested in her trust fund and the 25% voting shares of Lord &amp; Company.Enter the Handsome Prince in the form Kevin Doyle, newly hired doorman for Cornelia's apartment building.Kevin and Cornelia's story is a great romp and a fresh twist on an age-old story.I also went out onto the net and found information on Nikola Telsa. What an interesting man....no wonder the author used him as the focus of Cornelia's interest and energy!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"It's a love story, no, wait! it's a story about family relationships.

It was like I just got into the story as I read the first words.. The story is about a doorman, Kevin Doyle falling in love with the rich girl Cornelia. They go through numerous adventures alone and the author Chris Gilson writes off letting readers closer to the characters. I can't believe this is Chris Gilson's first novel!"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I am SHOCKED at how many loved this book! I hate to put negative comments on Amazon...but I don't think I could have slept tonight if I didn't comment on this one. I thoroughly disliked this book I'm afraid. I really struggled trying to even finish it. It had HORRIBLE language btw. Luckily my sister had edited for me before she loaned it to me. I really would not recommend this to anyone. Sorry:(...like I said I hate to be negative, but this book just was NOT for me."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I love the fairy tale feel of this novel. The love story sort of reminds of Cinderella. Yes, the story of a poor man falling for a rich girl is quite banal, but the novel's irresistible charm kept me turning the pages.The story is about Cornelia Lord, a deeply misunderstood young woman following a dream: to give Nikola Tesla, the inventor of modern electricity, his rightful place in scientific history. Her determination, however, is taken away by Tucker, Chester Lord's (Cornelia's father) right-hand man. In order to earn 30 million dollars on his thirtieth birthday, Tucker has to sweet-talk his way into the altar; he has to marry Cornelia before she turns twenty-one. But a charming new doorman named Kevin Doyle sweeps her off her feet. There are some interesting twists and turns in the novel.The writing is wonderful; Mr. Gilson is very talented. Also, he must have done his homework -- the information in the novel is precise. My favorite character in the book is Kevin Doyle; his passion and earnestness are funny. The other characters are also great. This is a beautiful love story that will capture your heart. A cliche story? Yes, perhaps. Is it worth reading? Absolutely! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Kevin Sebastian Doyle never wanted to enter the family business. He simply wanted to be an artist, but eating being a minor nuisance, Kevin accepted the position his Uncle Eddie obtained for him as the doorman at a posh apartment building on the corner of 65th and Fifth.Like father like son, Kevin goes about his job as expected until he meets one of his clients, penthouse resident debutante Cornelia Lord. The media considers Cornelia to be a party going bimbo. Her father, head of an investment bank, thinks she is crazy. Her father's top aid, Yale graduate and former football star, Tucker Fisk thinks she is a nut case, but wants to marry her anyway.Kevin meets Cornelia by saving her life. They are immediately attracted to one another, but her \\"cause\\" has prompted her father to have her committed. Only Kevin remains her sole hope for rescue. If he succeeds can true love blossom out of this fairy tale relationship?CRAZY FOR CORNELIA is a crazy romantic romp that will leave the audience laughing at the antics of Cornelia and crew, especially her outlook at the world. The story line is entertaining, jocular, and never takes itself to the point of trying to save the universe because Cornelia would never allow that to happen. Instead, Chris Gilson shows a tremendous talent to turn a romantic fairy tale into an intelligent, offbeat, extremely humorous romp that will send readers looking for more tales by the author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"You could look at Crazy For Cornelia as a love story or whacky romance but then you would miss the subtle detail and historical facts that set certain authors in their own realm.The story itself is compelling but the references to Tesla's theories or even the doorman unions make every page of this book a delight. Unless the author, Chris Gilson, is a former doorman or electrical engineer, he spent a great deal of time on research.I don't generally read novels that don't include some form of Military takeover or police shootout, but this book could send me in a whole new direction: Solid writing.I'm looking forward to anything else Mr. Gilson writes and so should you!"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"It is so joyfully refreshing to be entertained and delighted by, and cheer for (!), a truly original female character. She is so wonderfully realized by the author that I just want to give Chris Gilson a big, big thank you for taking me on a fantastic trip and making all my emotions sit up and take notice. The characters and situations are unique and brilliantly crafted, the dialogue and humor are wonderful, and a good time was had by all. Thank you thank you for writing it, and for the hours of entertainment (I'm a slow reader) and delight."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"This fun romantic fable is set in New York City where Cornelia Lord is a debutante with a quirky determination to right an old wrong done by her family. Kevin Doyle is the doorman of her building, but also an aspiring artist. Then there is the bad guy, Tucker Fisk, plotting to cheat the Lord family out of their fortune by marrying Cornelia.The craftsmanship of the author is apparent. There's not a wasted word as the story flows smoothly along, capturing the reader's complete attention. I, myself, got so involved in reading it that I once went right by my stop on the subway and didn't even notice till I was way uptown. The characterizations are wonderful, even for the secondary ones. I especially loved Kevin's sister, Marne, a tomboy firefighter; Roni,a woman who drives a horse-drawn carriage in Central Park; and Cornelia's father, Chester Lord, the personification of a poor rich man.The author's crisp clear style of writing sparkles with the electricity which is a running theme throughout the book. Cornelia is obsessed with an obscure inventor who supposedly created electricity; Kevin does neon sculpture; there's a mental hospital surrounded by electric wires where electro-shock treatment is given. And then there is Cornelia's unique ability to see electric aura's around people. Along the way, I also learned something about neon sculpture. There's humor in the book too and I found myself smiling outright at times. It's always quite visual and I kept picturing what fun it would be as a movie, especially the last madcap scene. Recommended."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I bought this book because I was in the mood for something light and witty. The description on the back cover and the catchy descriptive phrases praising it, made me take the plunge.I was slightly disappointed when I finished it, but as the days went by I grew even more disappointed. I certainly cannot understand why the majority of readers have given it a 5-star ranking.As I see it, these were some of the major problems:--Lack of depth in some of the characters: Bad guys were ALL BAD, good guys ALL GOOD.--Predictable story line.--Full of cliches.--I felt no sparks, no chemistry between Kevin and Corny.However the main problem I had was that all the time I was reading it, I was haunted by the thought that the author had written the book with a &quot;Now a Major Motion Picture&quot; mentality. Another silly romantic comedy never measuring up to the yet unequaled &quot;When Harry met Sally&quot;. Another &quot;date movie&quot; which lures so many to the theaters, while secretly knowing it's better to wait until Blockbuster Video gets it.All that said, I read the book very quickly. Partly because it was light enough to use as an easy escape, partly because I was hoping it would turn into the intelligent, slightly-complex witty-comedy I thought I had bought. It had a great chance of doing that when Kevin joins Cornelia at her &quot;retreat&quot;; but well, after that it's all downhill.Who knows? Maybe a Penny Marshall or Nora Ephron can take this, work some of their magic, and come up with something for which I won't have to wait until movie-rental night."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"As soon as I read that the doorman was an artist who made neon saints, I knew I had to read this book. He's just a wonderful hero. This book is a romance although it is listed in literature and fiction. It's a terrific one and there isn't the slightest touch of the formulaic here that plagues some romance novels. A man wrote it and he did a heck of a job. This is also a very funny book in spots and you will LOL but it is more than balanced by some serious moments as well."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I have seeen this book reviewed several times, and didn't know exactly what to expect. The story is different, not a traditional romance, or a story that seems to easily fit into any one genre.Many media reviewers called it a Cinderella story in reverse, in which a poor doorman falls for a wealthy debutante, but it is really more of a Rapunzel fairytale set in modern day Manhattan -- and a very rich fairytale with some interesting bends on the usual good and bad elements.A 20-year-old debutante, beautiful but dysfunctional, a child of wealth and privilege, behaves so erratically that her insecure father and her too-slick-to-be-good fiance keep her like the princess Rapunzel, locked up on the 21st floor of an apartment building for seriously rich residents overlooking Central Park, held captive by a psychiatrist and a bodyguard so she won't run away and hurt herself.Cornelia is not crazy at all. Of all her moneyed friends, she is the most sane. She is obsessed with an inventor (a real person, I checked) named Nikola Tesla, who discovered modern electricity even though Thomas Edision got the credit and financial gain. Because of a secret I will not reveal, Cornelia believes it is her duty and destiny to make things right with Nikola Tesla, who wanted to broadcast free electricity to the whole world but was shut down by the robber barons at the turn of the 20th century who had all invested in Edison. Now, 100 years later, Cornelia has devoted her life to this cause for both personal and altruistic reasons.The only person who can see what a wonderful girl Cornelia is beneath the flaky behavior is the new doorman at her building Kevin Doyle, who is somewhat eccentric himself. He is a neon artist who has sculpted a perfect St Sebastian complete with neon arrows, but the art world is hardly ready for this. He is forced to take the doorman job, like his father and uncle before him. He resents the rich and is not impressed with what he hears of Cornelia Lord, who seems to be the girl who will always have everything, just wasting her advantages.But when he finally meets Cornelia, he is fascinated with her, and sparks fly when he saves her from a very funny collision between a Central Park horse-drawn carraige and her father's limo.It is difficult to describe the layers of this book, except to say that it is well-written, extremely witty, and had me going from the first chapter when Kevin starts the new job he hates and builds throughout to the most inventive story and dynamite ending I think I've seen in years.&quot;Don't try to classify it, just enjoy it,&quot; I saw in one review and that's the best advice I can give. I stayed up until 2 AM to finish, because you really, truly get to care about this quirky couple, and even the dithering, drinking father and driven fiance who is the boyfriend we love to hate.The book is not for everybody--if you're looking for a genre, mainstream romance you may be disappointed because this ain't Danielle Steele! But if you're up for a wild ride with something funny or intriguing in every paragraph, it will go on your keeper shelf. I can't imagine what the author will do next, because I can't immediately think of a book to compare it to. It's a little bit Arthur, a little bit The Graduate, and I suppose a &quot;cult&quot; book in the same way that the YaYa Sisterhood was a cult book--but it's not like that either. I give up. Just see for yourself."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I am so grateful to my friend for recommending this book!

Cornelia is also a free spirited high society debutante in today's New York's social scene on the Upper East Side. Kevin Doyle, her apartment house's doorman, becomes her &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; against malevolent villians in her family and friends to rescure her to a far better place and life.

Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The characters are neurotic and mean spirited. I took it on vacation for a &quot;beach read&quot; and trudged through it reluctantly just to see how it finished (my 9th grade english teacher taught me to always finish a book!). I admit that I'm more interested in family dynamics that are more realistic (and I believe that most people try to do good even if it's misdirected-- not evil) and I resent a string of &quot;make-believe&quot; characters that are conniving and vicious.I burned this book in the family bonfire after I read it!

Sit back, relax, and enjoy this wonderfully scintillating love story."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I must admit that I was prepared to like this book after going to an unusual event for Crazy for Cornelia at a local bookstore, which was more performance art than reading and drew a large crowd. Actors (good ones)performed scenes from the book, everyone drank free champagne, and one person won a chocolate leg in a post-Valentine's Day raffle for people who didn't do enough for their partner on Valentine's Day!.The author (a guy) turned out a friendly and funny. The book was a continuation of the performance in that it was unusual, very entertaining,more playful than literary, and deceptively breezy. A number of times, I found myself going back to re-read sentences that contained, almost off-handedly tossed off in the fast-moving, conversational style, wry comments on love, wealth and sanity in the '00s.The story begins with a fair amount of unfolding &quot;backstory&quot; about Kevin Doyle, a neon sculptor who has created a Saint out of pink tube but must take a despised day job as a doorman. Against his better judgement, he falls in love with Cornelia Lord, an heiress- debutante with an issue. She is beautiful and innocent (except for wild behavior that is not at all what it seems) . Nobody understands her, partly because she is systematically &quot;gaslighted&quot; by her fiance, who is using her for his own ambitions.It turns out that Cornelia the seemingly-flighty debutante and Kevin the glum but soldierly doorman share a massive dose of survivor guilt, which each tries to work through in an unusual way that takes the reader on a very wild, witty trip of twists and turns building up to an ending that I can somehow only see directed by Steven Spielberg and the Farrelly Brothers together--big, moving, and outrageously funny.Yes, the movie rights have been sold, but don't wait for the movie. This is an eccentric but very compelling book with a heart, plenty of humor, and enough wisdom not to take itself too seriously. I'm awaiting the author's next appearance here, and definitely his next book."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Crazy for Cornelia is a page-turner. I read it in two sittings, interrupted only by my work, and I'll tell you I would rather be reading this book than working anyday.Cornelia Lord, aka Electric Girl, is a 20 year old and oft-drunk debutante who swims in public fountains by night and in shark infested waters whenever she's near the truly evil Tucker Fisk, the handpicked manager of her father's banking empire. But it turns out that it's Tucker who is really pulling the cords as he networks his way into the heart of the Lord financial empire, stealing his way into the fragile hearts and insecure minds of the Lord family that has just recently lost the strong and perceptive guidance of the Elizabeth Lord, the mother figure to both of Corny and Chester. This, of course, would make for a typical and easy run of the mill story, but Tucker's capacity for evil is surprising, even to this jaded reader, as he engages in hostile takeover maneuvers, bribes doctors into hypocrisy rather than obey their Hippocratic Oath, and engage in all sorts of tactics that you would normally reserve for CIA operatives in Nicaragua or COINTELPRO agents in Berkeley or Harlem. Lucky for Cornelia, she has met Doorman Kevin Doyle, who first saves her from an episode of reputation-manufacturing papparazzi cameramen lurking at the back door and waiting to snap the next tabloid moneyshot of her looking stupid and embarrassing, and later pulls her from the path of her snow-sliding limosine after just having been thrown from a horse-drawn carriage riding the wrong way up Fifth Avenue. She is the only one who sees the blue arced corona over his head, and ends up teaching him a few things about electricity, monoply capitalism, fiber optics, and a man named Nikolas Tesla, the relatively unknown man who has given us the knowledge of alternating current, radio waves, and the energy particles that comprise lasers.This is a well-crafted and believable story with convincing dialogue from both Kevin Doyle's sometimes or always struggling working class friends, foes, and family, as well as the blue-blooded residents of the exceedingly wealthy residents of 840 Fifth Avenue. And author Chris Gilson leaves me no doubt about how he feels in this fictional treatment of Nikola Tesla's erasure from technological history and the history of how some have profited enormously from inventions and ideas Tesla first developed for the free use and general benefit of humankind."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I did enjoy the storyline. Rarely encounter my name in a book title so like that too. I learned a lot about Tesla, the electrical genius. All in all not as bad as some current fiction I've picked up. Usually, I read history."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Found the book very entertaining, always had me yearning for Corny's next crazy adventure.

It is yet another backwards Cinderella story adding to the already large mountain of books cashing in on this fairy tale. This one, however,is not half as good as many others that I've read. As a matter of fact, the premise was so \\"silly\\" that I had the impulse to close the book forever on many occasions. This was one of those books that I bought based solely on the already existing five star Amazon customer reviews of which I am now dubious.Cornelia Lord is the debutante daughter of wealthy Chester Lord. Kevin Doyle, a struggling \\"neon\\" artist, is the doorman at her Upper East Sidebuilding. Cornelia is also consumed, to the point of obsession, withthe man who she feels rightfully discovered electricity, Nikola Tesla.She has even dubbed herself \\"The Electric Girl\\" as she runsaround town working on a project that would reintroduce the world tothis inventor, hopefully opening their eyes to the \\"true\\"hero of electricity. Tesla has been dead for many years but died inpoverty never fully being appreciated for his efforts in bringinglight to the world. Cornelia is here to right this wrong.Unfortunately, there are many stumbling blocks in her way -- thebiggest one being her father's protege in business, Tucker Fisk. Heis the young son of Chester Lord's college roommate and has come toLord & Company to help Chester run it. His mind is really set ontaking over the company one day. Of course, if he can get Cornelia tofall in love with him, that would not only strengthen his goal butwould also make him a major shareholder if he can get her to marryhim.The one bright \\"light\\" in the book comes in the formof Kevin Doyle, the struggling artist and doorman, who wants tofulfill his dead mother's dream of paying homage to the martyredSt. Sebastian by building a neon sculpture to his image and likeness.He is so good-hearted to the point of being naive. But Corny will seesomething in Kevin's aura far beyond what others can see. Is thepumpkin coach ready to take them away? Will the glass slipper fit HISfoot?\\" I really didn't care as I found both the obsessions withNikola Tesla and St. Sebastian somewhat interesting but mostly inaneand ridiculous.For me, the only redeeming thing was the informationon Nikola Tesla. I did some research on this inventor after finishingthe book and his story is a somewhat sad but believable tale. Perhapsit was this author's intent to open the eyes of his readers to theinjustices endured by Tesla and did so by exposing them within thecontents of this novel."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"She is an upper-class WASP with a social conscience and a passion for the unsung 19th Century genius Nikola Tesla, the inventor of AC electricity who was defrauded from presenting free electrical power as his gift to the world by big-money interests representing plain old-fashioned greed. He is an Irish-American doorman with a passion for neon sculpture (picture, if you can do it with a straight face, a neon Saint Sebastian shot full of arrows). From such disparate backgrounds do great love stories grow. Kevin and Cornelia are two lonely young people, both having lost their mothers to freak accidents, both looking for love and finding each other. Cornelia's father is Chester Lord, of the great old-money firm Lord &amp; Co., and she is engaged to Tucker Fisk, her father's young partner, who gives a whole new definition to the word &quot;smarmy&quot;. Tucker is out to make &quot;30 by 30&quot;, meaning $30 million by his 30th birthday, and means to engineer this feat by a hostile takeover of his prospective father-in-law's corporation. Gilson knows how to hold our interest, and he keeps us turning pages wanting to know how Kevin is going to save the day and rescue Cornelia and her father's corporation from Tucker's evil clutches. Gilson has a wry sense of humor and he has thoroughly researched his topic; he knows whereof he writes. This is a highly successful and very enjoyable first novel. I'm looking forward to his next one."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Cornelia is a young socialite with a taste for the wild side. One begins to wonder if all is doomed as she is persued by the deceptive vilan, Tucker Fisk, the young business tycoon whom Cornelia's father views as his saving grace and Cornelia's. Yet, in an unexpected series of events Kevin Doyle, the doorman of the elite 840 Fifth Ave, finds his way into the tumultuous life of Cornelia. &quot;Crazy for Cornelia&quot; is a brilliant book that kept me glued to the pages. I look foreward to reading more of Chris Gilson's work in the future."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"While somewhat predicatable, &quot;Cornelia&quot; is a sweet-as-pie modern-day fairy tale, plain and simple. This book will make you tingle with the giddiness of new-found love, and the words sometimes seem to float off the pages. This book is strange and exciting and different, oh so different!Cornelia Lord is just about as bizarre as a gorgeous, 20-year-old millionaire socialite can be. Her obession with the late inventor Nikola Tesla provides a historical and educational content for the book. Of course, it also provides reason enough for her weakling father and his scum-bum assistant to throw her into the loony bin. Enter one contemporary Romeo to save the day!The chemistry between Kevin Doyle, doorman extraordinaire, and Cornelia can be felt practically leaping through the pages! I found myself, more than once, unable to put the book down. There were also times, though, that I couldn't wait to get to the end of a chapter out of boredom. Also, I think Chris Gilson sometimes grapples for wording when he writes about big business. Or maybe he was trying to dumb it down for the layperson. However, I was truly impressed with his knowledge about neon art. Maybe he knows someone on the inside...The end is satisfying albeit a bit conventional. All in all, &quot;Cornelia&quot; is a great read, and you'll feel the light-hearted thrill of forbidden romance once again."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"&quot;Corona&quot; will have an all new enlighted meaning upon reading this book. It's a fast paced story about two unlikely soul mates from two different worlds, one rich and one poor. It's hard not to get caught up in the high stakes intrigue and corporate double crossings with a smooth talking scandalous manipulative scoundrel. Haven't we all met one of those we love to hate? The intrigue was there and I stayed up until 3am to see what happened--and it was worth the lack of sleep. What a great summer read because it's easy to escape into Crazy for Cornelia."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Forget 5 Stars. This book deserves its own ranking system - like 10 stars! My biggest disappointment with Crazy For Cornelia was that I finished reading it. Gilson may just be this year's brightest new star on the fiction scene! The writing is masterfully hip and the plot is rich with surprise and audacity! We need more books from Gilson .....please!"},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"Crazy for Cornelia is a trip, but in a good way. You just have to suspend your ideas about what a love story is, because this one keeps throwing you curves.The dust jacket makes it sound like a romance about the rich, which it isn't. It's more a wildly imaginative variation on the old Cinderella fairy tale which becomes a magical experience once you get into it and go with the flow.It's about social class, and the need to trust, and hypocricy in art,medicine, business, and a pretty clever satire of American culture today.It starts from the point of view of a frustrated artist named Kevin Doyle who has found an art school on the back of a matchbook and, instead of making beer signs, has sculpted a neon saint. But Kevin's mother has died, and he goes to work in the kind of building you see in movies of New York City, with a staff of doormen and apartments full of musty old antiques and residents.The resident who isn't stuffy is Cornelia Lord, who acts so crazy she has her own papparazzo following her around taking photos to put in his tabloid column and make her look like a spoiled rich girl. He doesn't need to convince her father Chester and slimy fiance Tucker, who both want to get her in the hands of psychiatrists.Kevin the doorman rescues Cornelia from her at least half-well meaning family in a plan so audacious, I won't reveal it beacause it's LOL funny and unexpected.This book is addictive. You start to identify with the seriouslymisunderstood rich girl and the heroic artistic-doorman as they explore an electrical connection between them that has to do with the man who...never mind. I'd be doing you a disservice to give away more.Cornelia is the daffiest yet most root-worthy heroine I've seen in a while;her vulnerability conceals a toughness and resolve to fight an injustice thatshe feels partialy responsible for, and the fairy tale format of the book is a veneer which the author cracks with new spins on old cliches at every opportunity.The ending will convince you that love really does conquer all. And, by the way, the author is a man, another surprise. Have fun with this one."},{"Title":"Crazy for Cornelia","review":"I enjoyed this book. As a former deb, I can tell you the New York scene, from that point of view at least, was accurate. As for the plot...it has shades of &quot;Sabrina&quot; in my opinion. I can see this as the movie it has apparently already been optioned for very clearly. I hope they manage to keep the magic that makes it so charming.Take two people from opposite sides of the tracks, who have nothing in common except their integrity and passion for their own special causes in life... Throw in a former Ivy league football player who has no scruples and loves playing dirty to get what he wants... Add a fairy godmother or two (one a professor, one a carriage driver in Central Park)---and what have you got? This sweet story of Cornelia, a debutante who is terribly misunderstood, and her hero, Kevin, the doorman/artist.The only reason I can't give it five stars is that it is extremely slight. I wanted a bit more bang for my romance buck ( I won't go into this further, nope), but of course, because the author is an Ivy League WASP, what do you expect? He is much more comfortable describing scenes of New York life than feelings. The only thing that actually brought tears to my eyes was right at the end, when he mentions his own wife--the love of his life. You call tell from the way he writes about her, he has the real deal there.This amiable escapist novel is worth your time if you like to fall into love with love, in book form. In a ladylike manner, of course.!"},{"Title":"The Mirror of Time","review":"The book is short but is written with passion and great style. The book starts out in the early 1800s and ends up in present day. It is emotional and informative. It brought me into the circumstances of the book and left me having learned something and having drawn out my emotions alongside the characters in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone. I am eagerly awaiting the publication of a longer book from this author. She has a unique and powerful style of writing that expresses the point exceptionally. This book is suitable for teens and older, easy to read and packed with understanding. This book is a wonderful place to start if you are interested in Native American people.

The Conversational German course is actually the first 16 lessons of the full German 1 course of 30 lessons. I've since purchased the German 1 course and will also, I think, buy German 2, 3 & 4 (100 30 minute lessons in total) when the time comes. What I like best about the course so far is that it has a really beautiful gradient - it starts out easy and then gently, lesson by lesson, builds on the difficulty.

Using this and a book together has worked out for me."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I am a native English (US) speaker. I have taken many years of high school and college-level Spanish courses. On a recent trip to Spain, I realized (for the first time) that I had never properly been taught how to actual speak the language conversationally...only vocabulary, conjugations, very basic sentence structures.For personal reasons, I recently decided to try and learn German. I did not want to enroll in long, boring, inconvenient classes that would cost a fortune and yield few results despite the drastic investment of required time. So I tried a few other audio CD language-teaching courses. Within a lesson or two of each, I was so discouraged by the incredibly boring, hard-to-follow methods that I simply gave up. Then I ordered just the trial version (Quick and Simple) of Pimsleur's German. Before I had even finished those first 8 trial lessons, I was able to make (very) small talk with native German speakers! I was impressed enough that I went ahead and got German Comprehensive I, with every intention of following through Comprehensive II and III and Plus (and AllTalk, in conjunction). I must admit, I have slacked in my lessons...I have only finished 2/3 of Comprehensive I and should be well into Comprehensive II. Yet I can hold small conversations in German with my boss (a native German speaker), who has made numerous comments about her surprise at just how well I have learned pronunciation, sentence structure, and vocabulary...even after only 8-10 lessons!The Pimsleur German lessons are remarkable! They are simple, and require very little time or even concentration. You can follow along easily. It is brilliant just how each lesson is laid out:1. You hear a full conversation between two speakers, containing mostly words and sentences from previous lessons, with a few new ones thrown in2. A narrator points out the new words and sentences that you have heard, and explains/defines each3. The narrator asks you to use those new words, along with ones learned in previous lessons, to answer a few of his questions, with the German speakers following in answer shortly thereafter4. The narrator switches it up, and will randomly throw in questions about how to say things learned in previous lessons5. The narrator points out the differences in meaning when words are rearranged within the sentences, giving explanations and English-equivalents6. The conversation from the beginning of the lesson is \\"replayed,\\" with pauses for instructions for you to complete the second-speakers partsIt is a beautiful system that is very well-developed and incredibly beneficial. I would merely suggest that you thoroughly research the various resellers providing these lessons - new copies can range anywhere from $159 to $260 for the exact same cd's and packaging. Some resellers have very poor reviews for their customer service and shady billing, while others gleam with options. Personally, I have recently switched from the reseller I originally used to PimsleurMarketplace. The reseller from whom I originally purchased was one of those that charged $260 for a single new lesson, while the latter charrges the $159, and also has options to return your cd's after use for great credits toward your next lesson, or refunds, and even accepts those not purchased through that reseller. It also has a lot of other options (like reserves). But I'm sure that there are plenty of others out there that have just as great of service!"},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"Yes they do! BUT this teaching tool breaks it down into simple components to help you make those weird sounds without breaking a sweat.

I bought this CD course before a two week visit to Germany. My goal was to surprise my german speaking girlfriend with my new German skills. I spent about one half to one hour a day for three months listening to these CDs. (she had no idea of my secret plan) When I got to Germany, I totally blew her and her family away. She had no idea I was learning this on the sly, and was totally impressed with my skills. I also knew enough to travel around the country by myself, when I spent a few days on my own. I bought a used set off of amazon, and it was probably the best $15 I have spent. I would highly reccomend this system to anyone who wants to know just enough to get around, and be independent in a foreign country. To have real conversations and meaningful discussions, this won't do. But I plan on continuing with the course and developing my German further. I also plan to buy pimseleur (sp?) CDs for any other trips I'm taking in the future. It really opens up doors, and the process of learning the language is really fun. On my first day in Munich, I had the biggest smile on my face, the entire time. It was so exciting to speak German!"},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I bought Pimsleur's Conversational German because I have always been fascinated with Germany and its language, and at the time was preparing an application to study abroad there (I have since been accepted and will be going there this coming spring). A friend recommended Pimsleur and I decided to try it out.The first thing that surprised me is that this is a set of CD's. Though I am an auditory learner, I prefer having the words in front of me to get their spelling and so remember them better. Even so, the CDs started off well; it taught me the basics, such as hello, excuse me, how are you, and how to give directions, which all generally qualify as conversation (though directions strikes me as aimed at tourists). I didn't like how slow it was going, but then I am a very fast learner and pick up languages easily, so the pace was probably decent.Then, however, it became strange. Pimsleur taught me how to ask someone out to eat or to drink, and proceeded to teach me how to say beer and wine. It also taught me how to invite someone to my house or to their place. I also recall something about how to buy things as well. I do not consider this conversational German. I'm not sure WHAT kind of German this is; perhaps a mix between \\"tourist\\" and \\"how to pick up women\\"?A few months later, I remember very little of what the CDs taught me. They were extremely repetitive and ultimately bored me. Furthermore, the CDs give the listener no hint of how to form sentences or actually become fluent in German. Despite this, on a few occasions it expected me to be able to put together my own sentences without any knowledge of German grammar whatsoever. I had difficulty remembering phrases in the end because I had no basis to recall them; no knowledge of grammar, no knowledge of verb conjugation, nothing but repeated phrases over and over again.Ultimately, I found Pimsleur to a poor introduction to a language that I am fascinated by. It expects you to recall and then regurgitate phrases, which is a poor way to learn a language. I also don't see how half of these situations and phrases would come up during an average conversation; when studying abroad I am certainly not planning on asking someone if they would like to have a drink back at my place. Overall, there must be better language programs out there; I would not recommend this one.Thank you for reading, and I hope you found my review helpful."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"Very easy to follow, and learning a lot!

I have a friend who grew up in Germany many years ago. I can now converse with him on various subjects using good pronunciation and grammar because those are built into the course. I had tried for years to figure out German pronunciation from books with little success. I am over 60 years old, but my hearing is good and the instructions are clear. When I have trouble repeating what was said, I just go back and listen again and take my time learning to pronounce the words and phrases. The timing of the repeats really gets the lesson to stick in your memory without memorizing set phrases. You actually start to think in German in just a few lessons. I am often surprised that the half-hour lesson is already over. Since I already had the second half of the course, I am now working on the remainder of Basic Course I.

Then you ask her if she also wants a beer, as apparently she's either an alcoholic or you're trying to get her looped. So while you learn a little bit of German very well, it doesn't quite build enough vocabulary to have a conversation much beyond \\"I know a little German but I don't speak it well.\\" And you'll sound like you're kidding when you say it with such good pronunciation, rendering the phrase almost useless."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I listen to these CDs while I am riding my bike!

The pronunciation is off from what I learned; my teacher was from Germany, his second language was english and first was German. Overall this will get you through the cities of Germany but not the countryside or K&ouml;ln.

I've tried Hueber, Langenscheidt, PONS and Rosetta Stone courses, but even though I was averaging 2 to 4 hours a day studying the language, I found these courses tedious and never came to the point where I could actually say anything beyond \\"Guten Tag\\" on the telephone. After a week using the Pimsleur method, I was able to hold simple conversations with my German co-workers. The best thing about this course is I am able to listen to it on the way to work, while getting dressed for work, sunning at the pool, etc. I am spending far less time studying but I'm learning at a much, much faster pace.I liked this course so much that I gave away my Rosetta Stone course, which cost a great deal of money, and I purchased the complete Pimsleur method (levels 1, 2, 3 and plus). A couple of my co-workers have borrowed my Pimsleur courses. I am currently mid-way through level 2 and I'm amazed at how quickly my vocabulary and understanding of the German language has increased. I now consider the hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars I've spent on other language courses a complete waste of money and effort.If I could give this course 100 stars, I would! In all fairness to the other courses, I have to say I did learn many words, but I could not form sentences correctly. It would take hours to compose a simple e-mail before and I could only do so if I had one of my German dictionaries beside me. Trying to speak to someone in German was impossible for me to do. I would never have believed I could learn so quickly. I am amazed. If you want to learn a foreign language - skip the other courses until after you've tried Pimsleur. I think some of the others are okay, but do the Pimsleur first. You'll understand the others much better. Other methods try to teach grammar first. But when you first learned to talk, you learned to speak it first - then you went to school to learn grammar.

I was amazed at how fast what I had learned 38 years ago came back to me. Even had I not remembered any German, the lessons would still have been easy to learn. However, some lessons you will probably have to listen to a couple of times to be sure you master at least 80% of the lesson.This particular short course is good for one reason and that is to see if you want to learn the German language, never having studied it before. Its an inexpensive way to \\"get your feet wet\\". However, if you already know you that want to learn enough to get you past ordering food, asking directions or dealing with vendors, get Level I of the Pimsleur oomprehensive course.This Conversational German course is the same as the first 16 lessons of the 30-lesson Level I course. I wish I had discovered that before I ordered this shorter course but that's my fault."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I took German in high school (30ish years ago) and was taught the way many of us have been taught...the ball, the bed, I am hungry,etc. but this course was a pleasant surprise. Basic conversational words and phrases are repeated and gradually built upon.If you are sincere about brushing up on or learning German then this is the course for you! However, after doing the Conversational German, which is lessons 1 thru 15, I was hungry for more and bought the German 1 course. German 1 is lessons 1 thru 30+. So if you plan on getting serious, save your money and jump into German 1.I was actually pleased with the fact that with the purchase of a German verb book, the Pimsleur courses really teach you basic conjugation without boring drills...ich bin, du bist and so forth.With Pimsleur, you are getting what you pay for. An incrdible product!!"},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I have taken 'The short course', which is audio CDs only. I am a tainted reviewer of the Plimseur method because I have taken a community college course on Conversational German.The weaknesses of this method are these:- acquisition of grammar and vocabulary is slow.- there's no reading or writing of German.- there's no advice about how to form the German sounds. (The CD has a barrage of examples, but you are left on your own to figure out how to make the sounds. This is harder than you might think.)- so much concentration is required during the lesson that I don't think it would be safe to drive or operate machinery while listening to these CDs. If you're looking for a CD for the car, this isn't the course for you.The stengths of this method are:- it's good listening practice.- there's more speaking practice than I got in a classroom setting.- there's more pronunciation practice than I got in a classroom setting.- the little material that is covered is constantly reinforced.- it's a good method if you get flustered by grammar terms such as 'nominative pronoun', 'genitive case', 'declension', and 'indirect object'. The Plimseur method is mercifully free of all that.- there's no effort outside the half hour daily lesson!- all you need is an audio CD player.Some reviewers claim that you don't acquire any grammar, but that's not true. The course introduces German grammar concepts by example. The idea is that you acquired English grammar by example, not by grammar rules; therefore, you should acquire German grammar the same way. It is certainly more natural than memorizing rules, but is also a very slow way to acquire German grammar.The cast of each lesson are a male German speaker, a female German speaker, and 'the tutor'. The tutor tells you when to listen to the speakers, when to repeat what they say, and sometimes quizzes you! It's uncanny how the CD anticipates stumbling points and tutors the student through them. It's a lot like having a live tutor, except a live tutor could tell you whether you were making the sounds correctly. One nit of the CDs is that I was never sure whether I was making the sounds correctly, and it's a little hard to speak German consonants in the time alloted.These CDs would be pretty good if you were planning travel to Germany and wanted to learn enough German to get by. These CDs are good for the casual student who has a quiet half hour a day for a lesson (but not while driving). For the serious student of German, the CDs are good practice of speaking skills, and are good for improving your German accent.I rate the short course 3/5 stars. What's there is very, very good. For full marks it would need more pronunciation coaching, and some reading material."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"This has been and is great. It is taking me several reviews of each lesson to feel comfortable in speaking and not having to \\"think\\" of my response, but it just comes - which is amazing. The only drawback, is that sometimes the pronounciations seem to change, especially between the female speaker and the male speaker, and I'm not talking about the way you are to say a word, but when they break it down and then say it whole, the next time they say it is sounds different.But, I would recommend this to anyone. I haven't listened to any other languages, but if I need to, I would go to the Pimsleur programs first."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I was looking for audio course that would refresh what I had learned in high school years ago and provide additional vocabulary.

I come from a generation that expects instant gratification, so these CD's were the way to go. I drive about 45 minutes to work each way, which is a little more than one lesson. They reccommend only covering one lesson a day, to which I agree. After the very first lesson I was really excited and was amazed at how much I took away from it. I was walking around the office reciting to myself like an idiot. Just this week I finally got done with the 16th (and final) lesson of this series, and my opinion of this series is still the same.It rocks! Complaints? There are some things that are drilled over and over that seem fairly trivial, but when it comes to putting it all together in a complete sentence, it seems a little rushed. I also wished they would have drilled more on the different ways to put some words together and better explained the multiple usages for certain words. I like the fact that they offer a male and female speaker that mostly recite the same word or sentence so you can hear different pronunciation differences to confirm you're getting it right. One other thing I appreciated is that most of what is taught on the CD's was just enough to be able to just barely survive in a German speaking environment. You can greet people, ask for food, get directions, and even order a drink for someone. It should be noted that I also purchased the Berlitz Method German book, and it did NOTHING for me. I have been told, and I now agree, that you should hear and speak the language before ever trying to read it. I am currently waiting for my order of Pimsleur's German Level 2 & 3. based on my experience with this CD set. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I found the Pimsleur Conversational German set to be helpful learning the pronunciation of the German language. The program carefully takes you through how to annunciate many words and/or phrases. However, I did not find this program helpful with the overall structure of the language, or how to understand and build sentences, etc.Also, I found it difficult to understand some of the words/phrases it went over without any visual assistance. The disks are audio only, and I found the lack of actually seeing what the program was trying to teach me very bothersome.I ended up purchasing the Rosetta Stone program 1 for German and it was much better. And also very much more expensive!!!"},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"The product is a wonderful value and saved our vacation. Please note that this is an introductory course and is not comprehensive by any means. We were told that most everyone in Germany spoke English but found many uncomfortable to do so. This product gave me enough German to convey my wants and desires. The lessons are easy to follow and teach by hearing and speaking. I was able to review all the material in two weeks and got many compliments on how well I sopke the language. This product would be helped greatly by some written material for back up.

It is well made and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Germany.I didn't rate it higher however because it so easily could have been a lot better better.It seems like they have they have a fixed silence time for you to respond to instructions. It feels like they give you maybe 5 seconds to respond before proceeding and talking right over your response. This is fine for disc one or two when your response is supposed to be \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". By disk five or six however it gets kind of crazy. I have trouble saying \\"Yes, I would like something to eat and drink at your place on Beethoven St. a little later\\" in English in less than five seconds, let alone in German. If you are using it in a CD player with a Pause button, you can use it and ignore this issue. In my car, without a pause, it was very annoying.The next issue I guess would be harder to correct but is also confusing and annoying. One benefit to listening instead of reading a new language is you should learn it without a strong American accent. The problem here is the two German speakers pronounce the same words very differently. It is like learning English by listening to a man from Boston talk to a woman from Louisiana. They both are speaking German but as to which pronunciation you should imitate, good luck. Very frustrating at times as the differences are pretty big. I would have been happier if they in the beginning acknowledged this in some way and perhaps offered some advice. Something perhaps like \\"She is from Vienna, and he is from Berlin so you will notice some differences in their pronunciations\\" would have been appropriate. Instead the narrator pretended they were identical."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"This method leads to quick conversations. I am amazed at how easily I am learning the vocabulary and sentences. It is not uncommon for you to surprise yourself when the instructor asks you to say, \\"Would you like something to eat?\\" and you find yourself quickly saying the phrase. The Pimsleur method does not use visual learning at all, so that is one warning for those who may want to see something like a picture or phrase written out, but for me it has been a refreshing new way to learn a language."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I bought these CDs to learn German during my commute in the car. It is effective in teaching you how to pronounce words and familiarizing you with native German accent. But it is so basic, and I found myself a bit frustrated with the repetition. For example, how many times to I need to repeat \\"Nein, Danke\\"? I think I learned it the first 12 times I was asked to say this. Can we please move on with some real phrases? You will find that the pace of the program is very slow. For instance, each lesson (30 min long) only introduces you to less than 5 new words. I think they do this so that EVERYONE (even those with...uhum...less than average intelligence) can learn what's on the CDs. Not that I'm any smarter than your average Joe, but I found myself frustrated with the slow pace.At the end of this course (16 thirty minute lessons), you can greet someone, ask them for very basic directions, learn how to use the words 'would like', 'to eat', 'to drink', 'to understand', 'to speak', etc. You get a very basic understanding of sentence structure...for instance, how to say \\"I would like to drink something with you tonight at your place\\".All in all, an okay purchase for what you get and the price...but for the promises the cover makes, it under-delivers."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"The disks work great.

You should be aware that the \\"abbreviated\\" versions of this otherwise excellent programme were introduced by Simon & Schuster as a LOW-PRICED TEASER, in an effort to entice you to purchase the infinitely more complete COMPREHENSIVE courses. However, the \\"abbreviated\\" versions contain nothing more than the first few lessons of the \\"comprehensive\\" versions. So, if you purchase these low-priced teasers and then purchase the Comprehensive-I package, you will have paid for first the 8 or 16 lessons twice. Believe me, if you purchase the abbreviated version, you WILL be enticed! So, do yourself a favour and simply purchase the Comprehensive-I package.

I wasn't disapointed! I can see why Pimsleur's method is \\"Scientifically Proven\\"... They start off with a phrase, tell you what each word means, and then repeat it word by word (very clearly pronounced) and you repeat it back, until you can say the whole phrase just as it was spoken to you. Then they add some variations or extra words to the phrase so you get an idea of the grammar (ie. how to turn a phrase into a question, or add \\"not,\\" \\"no,\\" \\"please\\" or \\"very\\" to it.)Pimsleur uses both male and female speakers so you can hear the realistic ways of saying the female/male words and also you get some variety in the way the words sound.The method is so effective, that you probably won't even have to listen to each half-hour lesson more than once if you pay attention, as each subsequent lesson build upon what you've just heard and has you continue to repeat it. At the beginning of each lesson the tape has you listen to a conversation, and then you learn how to say the things they just said. At the end, they have you partake in the conversation, and you realize how much you learned.I highly recommend Pimsleur to anyone. Now I speak German to my family to confuse them, and I'm looking forward to someday going to Germany."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I am going to Germany & Austria for two weeks. Second time. I also had two years of high school German 35-years ago and so had a latent knowledge of conjugations, grammer and some vocabulary. I chose an audio course rather than phrase books because book learning the language did not seem the best route for a tourist. Before arriving this time, I wanted my ears tuned up.I did get through the 16 half-hour units of Pimsleur: German conversation. This brand is completely audio on these early units. The method uses a particular style of repetition that requires you to both mimic the voice actors and answer simple questions posed by the narrator. Although there is repetition, its important to characterize it as \\"revisits\\". The Pimsleur theory is that words repeated too much loose their meaning and the brain tunes repitition out. Instead it revisits, typically in the form of a question, at ever increasing intervals. Just when your brain thinks its ok to delete from short term memory, you're confronted. This seems to not only establish a particular object in memory but also strengthens the brains skill or mechanisms for recalling what is almost out of reach.This method plus format does not produce deep vocabulary or grammer within the 16 lessons, but its good for training your brains ability to deal with the audio portion of language. It works for me. Typically in a unit, on the first pass I would feel like an observer, struggling to overhear a conversation between the two actors. Then the next day, without any additional effort, I would find that my audio processing had been rewired enough that I felt inside the conversation rather than outside. There was this delay to get rewired, but the results were satisfying.To pick up vocabulary and grammer, yes you will need to supplement this with flash cards and books. My understanding is that Pimsleur's follow on units have some written content. I'm also not done with Pimsleur. Next Italian, then Cantonese."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"okay, so far have only hit the first lesson, and already I recall more from the first lesson than from any reading materials. Even my son was listening and speaking along with me and he's 7. I think I'm gonna have to agree with Pimsluer on his teaching method, listen and speak first before reading and writing it."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I was stationed in Germany 15 years ago. I am going back this Dec so I wanted to brush up / learn German so I'm not lost when I get there. The CD's proved to me that I actually remembered much more than I expected. I didnt think my vocabulary was that good until I listened to all 16 lessons. These CDs were not very helpful to me. If you spent anytime in Germany and got off the base on a regular basis, these cd's probably wont help you much."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"First, let me say, that learning German will require lots of talking to other people in German. Second, I would also recommend several learning sources including classes. That said, I think the Pimsleur language programs are absolutely the best on the market. The approach is very organic, much like the way you learn a language as a child. While they do not have the instant gratification of Rosetta Stone's multiple choice method, I think the end results plant themselves more firmly in your brain than the RS method.If your main goal is to spend a few weeks studying a language and walk away feeling like you know something (but in actuality don't) then, by all means, go with Rosetta Stone. If you are really interested in learning German, I'd recommend Pimsleur as a great source of lessons.One thing worth mentioning is that, unlike most other German language lessons, Pimsleur teaches very little grammar directly. This can be, for the English-speaking beginner, a bit confusing at times, when adjectives in front of words suddenly change seemingly at random. Nonetheless, I would recommend this set of audio tapes to any serious student of German."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"This is an excellent way to introduce a language. The Pimsleur German course operates based on structure and vocabulary separately: rather than learning phrases, you learn speech. This actually teaches you the language, even though it leaves vocabulary far behind.As far as structure versus vocabulary goes, consider the syntactic layout of a language. In German, \\"I am going to drink,\\" \\"I am drink,\\" and \\"I drank\\" are the same; so \\"I drank beer\\" or \\"I will drink beer\\" would be \\"Ich trinke Bier.\\" As far as vocabulary goes, you may also want to drink a beer: \\"Ich m&ouml;chte ein Bier trinken.\\" Now you have used the vocabulary \\"Ich,\\" \\"Bier,\\" and \\"trinken\\" in multiple structures. This means the words are familiar; the structure needs little explanation and is eventually learned by exposure.Discussing Wine (Wein) or \\"something\\" (etwas) to eat would reuse structure rather than vocabulary. You may have something to eat: \\"Ich habe Etwas essen.\\" The same structure \\"I (verb) (noun) to (verb)\\" has been reused, and is immediately familiar when presented (by context of the lesson, which explains what's about to be said). Half of this sentence (its structure) is familiar; the rest (its vocabulary) you will learn.These blend together constantly, reusing structure and vocabulary constantly rather than constantly reusing the same structure to teach 300 vocabulary words (\\"I ate pie\\" \\"I ate chicken\\" \\"I ate beef\\" etc to teach you the words for \\"pie\\" \\"chicken\\" \\"beef\\"). Most significantly, every lesson starts with a short conversation and ends with a longer conversation. Because of this, language vocabulary and structure comes into play strongly: the conversations flow, and so cannot reuse simple structure or overuse vocabulary.Because of this method, you actually learn the language well before you can make use of it. You're already used to hearing and speaking German; but at the end, you have 50-100 vocabulary words to work with, and can barely ask for directions or buy food. Further study will fill in quite quickly, simply expanding your vocabulary and adding finer points of grammar and structure on. I found that even only on lesson 5 or 6, I understood German as German and not as English-German translation; I actually speak German, rather than thinking in English and working to translate to German.Whether you plan to continue with Pimsleur German I or take another strategy such as reading a book in German or studying formally in class, Conversational German is an excellent place to start and will bootstrap your understanding of the language extremely well. 4 years of Spanish study out of a book (high school, college) left me struggling to study, still trying to call up conjugation rules and vocabulary; 16 lessons of spoken German have left me not understanding those rules in any formal manner, but able to speak fluidly. Also, I only study sparsely; but I retain 100% of the information absolutely, even if I drop off for 3-4 months at a time. If I had to go to Germany, I would be confident in my ability to expand my understanding of the language in a matter of days or short weeks to fit whatever need I find."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I have been amazed that I have been able to learn the language so fast. I truly think this is an excellent program."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"For some reason, I often come to meet German people here and there throughout my life, and I thought it's a sign and time for me to learn how to communicate in German. I used regular traditional method to learn German by textbook and Berlitz cassette decades ago, but never passed very introductory level. Lately I had another occasion to meet very nice German people while traveling in the UK, and thought I should seriously start learning German again. After a friend of mine recommended me to Pimsluer, I decided to give it a try instead of buying Rosetta Stone. These conversational courses are only audio based, which is very attractive to me as I don't have time to read the textbook, or sit in front of the computer to follow a software. I basically listened to it only when I was in the car to ran errands, and sometime spend short time when I was browsing Internet or doing some chores around the house. I made sure that I repeat everything out loud and practiced one lesson for several times until I feel comfortable moving on to the next lesson. I was amazed how well the words stick to my mind, and whenever I say a word or a short phrase that I also know in German, what I learned come to my mind very easily. I like the fact that it doesn't teach vocabulary to vocabulary, but right into sentences from the beginning. I'm sure a bit of knowledge in German that I acquired in the past is sure helpful, but this is the most effective language program that I ever used so far. Unlike Rosetta Stone, you can copy the CDs as many times as you want, and no textbook or software to go over. If you are like me, then Pimsleur is for you, but if you prefer to use the other study materials with visual, you might want to consider Rosetta Stone.Pimsleur's conversational courses are a beginning half part of their comprehensive course, which comprises part A and part B. So what you getting is part A of their comprehensive German I. If you know for sure and you are very committed to the learning, I would recommend that you get their comprehensive I right from the beginning."},{"Title":"German, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand German with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur)","review":"I have been trying out different language learning products and this one is pretty good.

However, weare not children and adults have been taught to learn by reading. Listening just reinforces what we have learned.

Simply put, the ancient Code stated that when the land was ruled by native kindness, decency, and common sense then the whole population would prosper. However, when kings, nobles, merchants, and just neighbors behaved badly and selfishly, then the whole land would suffer in turn. Not only that, but supernatural powers would be raised to punish the wicked and set all things right once again. It was the same basic story in all times and places, from Mesopotamia and Palestine, to Greece and Rome, to China and Japan. Wickedness, selfishness and greed would always be punished- the common people would be protected or avenged. Nowhere was it ever taught that &quot;greed is good.&quot; Those kingdoms and civilizations that ignored this timeless lesson lost their prosperity and suffered disaster after disaster until they were destroyed....The agents that dispensed this justice came in many forms: spirits, gods, daemons, jinn, and angels. Sometimes they were benevolent wizards, sages, and holy men. No matter what their form, they were all servants of the mighty machine of cosmic justice.This is a handsomely designed hardcover with gilt printing on the cover, a full color insert of King Midas, and marbled end papers.

In a sense, they compliment each other very well. While Latimer focuses on the actual combat, giving you a &quot;worm's eye view&quot; in many cases, Bungay choses to focus more on the institutions and leaders that participated.In this sense, Bungay reviews the armies that fought: Italians, UK/Commonwealth, and German. Logistics, politics, morale, leadership, docrtine, and tactics are all assessed. By doing so, Bungay provides a wealth of information on why the battle developed as it did. The actual battle is dispensed with in a chapter or so, more as a way of demonstrating that the institutional factors predicted the nature of the battle.This is a good book, particularly if you are interested in how command, doctrine, tactics, and politics influence what occurs on the battlefield.

It was in WW2 terms, a small battle but in terms of consequences, it had major significance. It was a battle that probably Britain did not even need to fight but for their morale, they had to fight and win.Having said that for this reason much has been written on this battle but Stephen Bungay has managed to put a new twist on the battle. Whereas most people discuss the actual battle, he tends to discuss the factors that go around the battle as well eg the supply line, generalship and the respective airforce. In a very interesting way.I find myself disputing one minor point eg German air force kills where he states that on 9/01/42 Marseille shot down 17 British aircraft in one day. In fact on that day, the British lost 11 planes to all causes including AA fire. As pilots often tend to exaggerate their kills, Stephen Bungay should have been more careful in accepts such facts on face value. On the other hand I do agree with his conclusions that as the *star* German pilots tended to consider their purpose to build up scores not the mission and to some extent the German system encouraged this aim, this resulted in the German airforce not doing their mission properly.If you are looking for a book to start you off on Alamein or looking for a book to give you some new insight into this battle, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Alamein","review":"Successful modern business strategist Stephen Bungay previously brought his formidable analytical skills to examine the Battle of Britain in his impressive book \`The Most Dangerous Enemy', a defining work in understanding that important historical conflict.In this shorter work about the desert campaign culminating in the Battle of El Alamein, Bungay once again brings his intelligent analytical mind to examine the conflict from perspectives focussed not only on the battlefield, the armies and their equipment, but on the political and strategic hinterland governing the motives and actions of the various participants.Of inestimable importance, the author illustrates, is the big picture. Hitler saw the Mediterranean theatre as a sideshow to his invasion of the USSR, sent the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK) under Rommel to Libya to prevent Mussolini suffering the humiliation of total defeat at the hands of the British Commonwealth forces, and simply wanted \`not to lose.' The DAK never received sufficient resources or supplies to finish off the British forces because British warships, submarines and aircraft based in Malta were sinking their supply ships all the time, and when the DAK reached Alamein their supply tail was too long and continuously harassed by the allied air forces. The Panzerarmee Afrika which comprised roughly even numbers of German and Italian forces - fundamentally unsuited as allies - were unable to invade Egypt and occupy Cairo and Alexandria partly because of these factors (and partly Auchinleck's skilled defensive battle). Occupying Cairo was not something Hitler was enthusiastic about, though Mussolini greeted the prospect with great relish and looked forward to riding into Cairo on a white horse as \`The Conqueror of Egypt.'Churchill by contrast wanted to win in North Africa and dominate the Mediterranean, rather than just \`not lose' and was never content with a stalemate. There were important strategic and political reasons for fighting and winning the battle at Alamein, which the 8th Army did not need to fight for military reasons because the \`Torch' landings would have ultimately led to Rommel being attacked from the west by overwhelming allied forces and having his supply lines severed. The battle had to be fought and won to prove that the British Army could defeat an equivalent German Army fighting under a German general; to rebuild the 8th Army's confidence as \`winners'. Stalin on the one side, and the Americans on the other, also needed to be convinced that Britain was an effective ally with a hard-fighting army which could comprehensively defeat the Wehrmacht in the field on its own. Secondly, the victory was needed to secure Churchill's position at home, as by 1942 his conduct of the war was being criticised and he had already faced a censure motion in Parliament. Churchill certainly made the most of the victory: after November 1942 his position as PM was never challenged until the 1945 election.The early chapters cover the strategic war; the tactical war - with an enlightening examination of the different command styles of the Italian, British and German forces, the latter with their \`Mission Command' philosophy proving superior on the battlefield; the supply war with a long and detailed section about the importance of Malta which the Axis forces planned to invade (and needed to) but never did; and an excellent chapter \`The Soldiers' War' redolent of the author's incisive no-holds-barred analysis of aircrew experiences in \`The Most Dangerous Enemy.'The personality issues between the Germans and Italians, between Kesselring and Rommel, between the British commanders in charge of Malta's air defences and between Montgomery and almost everyone, are dealt with by the author with skill and insight. Bungay is a thorough researcher who wherever possible goes back to original sources - like Rommel's letters to his wife Lucie for example, which are continuously quoted in the book. An examination of the governing philosophies of the two opposing air forces is also very illuminating. The Desert Air Force focussed resources in support of the ground troops by attacking the enemy's formations and supply columns; the MO of the Luftwaffe's fighter arm in contrast was that everything operationally should feed the objective of upping the kill scores of a handful of \`Ace' pilots in order to feed Goebbels' propaganda machine for civilian morale-boosting, so the RAF's bombers attacking Rommel's troops were left largely unmolested (\\"the bombers had tail gunners\\"). The RAF therefore proved incomparably more effective both strategically and tactically, and although the Me109F was superior in every way to Hurricanes and American lend-lease P40s, it was the RAF who eventually gained air superiority and ensured the ground victory was decisive.Montgomery might have never emerged from relative obscurity had the transport plane carrying Gott (the initial appointee as 8th Army commander) not been shot down, killing him with others on board. The choice of Monty to replace Gott was greeted by Churchill with scepticism. Bungay does not lionise Monty and is fully aware of his notoriously \`difficult' side, but explains where these attitudes originated and demonstrates convincingly that he was exactly what the 8th Army needed at the time. Most importantly Monty recognised that British troops often referred to the DAK simply as \\"Rommel\\" and were in awe of the German general. Monty was the first British general to appreciate the importance of what we would now term media management to a wider audience, and by consciously and deliberately marketing himself as a recognisable personality with whom the troops could identify, responded directly to the personality cult around Rommel by creating a counterpoint in himself. He also galvanised the Army in ways his predecessors Auchinleck and O'Connor, for all their achievements and tactical abilities, failed to do. By emphasising training, supplies, inter-arm battlefield co-operation and above all, morale, he told them directly, face to face that they were going to win and \\"there is no doubt about it.\\" He played to the strengths of the 8th Army and within the limitations of what could be achieved, made it an effective fighting machine; he gave it unassailable confidence in itself and in its leadership. \\"Montgomery's was a double achievement\\", writes Bungay, \\"He fought the battle the army could win, and created the army to win the battle...he had to do a lot more than Rommel, who did not have to build professional skills because the German General Staff had done that in the 1930s. Neither in fighting the battle nor in building the army was Montgomery 100% successful...but successful enough to get a decision on that battlefield and turn the army into an instrument capable of winning battles to come.\\"Bungay is a superb writer with an engaging, direct style, intelligent and highly literate. Often humorous and always interesting, his books are page-turners and thoroughly enjoyable. His modern management analysis skills bring new perspectives to these historic events.Among the scores of books in print on the desert campaign, Bierman and Smith's excellent \`Alamein: War without Hate' which covers the entire North African campaign until the surrender of all Axis forces in Tunisia in the spring of 1943, makes an excellent companion to Bungay's insightful analysis and can also be unconditionally recommended."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"&quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; is the ultimate culmination of mystery, suspense, action, intrigue, and science fiction. The book grabbed me from the moment I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was gripping and inventive at the same time, the fact that the novel was a collection of short stories tied together by one character gives sort of a fourth person perspective. There is a morbid, almost mean spirited side to the stories, but that only adds to the philosophical and intellectual value of the book. All science fiction readers would love this novel."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"It is a good book ,but it is dark and violent. In the story &quot;The Visitor&quot; Saul learns that if many people fight over one thing it ends up wrong.Saul says &quot;We did not want to kill we killed.&quot; I learned that to much of one thing can drive people insane.

I enjoyed this book because it had some ideas that I have never thought about before (no, not all 13 year olds are idiots who can't think deeply), such as ZERO HOUR. Some stories were neat because you could see what people thought the future would be like.

I am a high school student and I would like to ask a question to those &quot;children&quot; who suppossedly read the book. How old are you? Most of you who wrote reviews didn't deserve to put your crude comments in whereas you should not have read the book unless you were mature enough to read it. I thought that it was a pretty good book. It may not be one of his best, but it was good enough!

It was a really good one to start with, as it had a fairly simple and uncomplicated storyline, a small cast of characters, and fairly well-defined themes and literary techniques. Therefore, teaching it to students who weren't native speakers (but whose English was really good nonetheless) was a good experience.I hadn't read a whole lot of Bradbury prior to that, and really fell in love with the book. F451 was a great read, and something I'll review here once I've let it settle down a bit in my head. After all, I've spent the last couple of months teasing every shred of meaning I could out of it, and that's not the kind of review I write here, now is it? Reading the book gave me a new interest in reading Bradbury, so I picked up a couple of short story collections and started to make my way through them. While I was talking to my department head about it, she recommended that I read The Illustrated Man, a copy of which she just so happened to have sitting around.The Illustrated Man is a collection of eighteen short stories, more or less unrelated, but brought together under the larger, over-arching story of the Illustrated Man himself. Our narrator, you see, meets a large man on the road. The guy is covered with tattoos, of the highest quality. Their colors are vivid, their details are lifelike, and the man says that, at night, the tattoos come alive. They tell stories, if you watch them long enough. And if you watch them too long, you may see your own future as well....Well, the narrator decides to watch as the Illustrated Man sleeps, and what he sees are the stories that are presented in this volume.By and large, the stories are unconnected to each other, which means we can go from a strange future where one family's house takes care of all their material needs to a poor farmer who manages to avoid the end of the world by being in one of his own. Still, there are a few thematic threads that run through the book that are interesting to look at.One of these themes is the way we relate to technology. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the first tale of the book, \\"The Veldt.\\" In this story, we meet a family who are completely dependent on their house. It's a technological miracle, where everything is completely automatic. The thought of actually cooking a meal is tantamount to barbarism, and their idea of taking a vacation means just shutting down the more obsequious functions of the house. One of these is the children's nursery. Akin to the holodeck, this room can replicate any environment that the users want. The children's fascination with the savagery of the African savanna worries their parents, though, and the threat of having the room shut down eventually becomes more than the children - or the house - can tolerate.In \\"The Concrete Mixer,\\" a Martian invasion force finds themselves overcome by the technology of Earth. Not the military technology, mind you, but the mindless, brain-destroying technology of leisure. Faced with TV and radio, casinos and bars, drive-in movies and fast food, the Martians discover that Earth is far more dangerous than they had ever expected. In \\"Marionettes, Inc,\\" Bradbury weaves a tale worthy of Philip K. Dick, telling about a very special service that will create an exact android duplicate of yourself. This robot will do all the tedious things in your life, such as go to work, do chores and tolerate your spouse. But what if the perfect robot duplicates are too perfect, and decide that they don't really want to do the drudgery anymore? In \\"The City,\\" a self-aware metropolis wakes up after twenty thousand years with the arrival of human astronauts - and immediately begins planning its revenge on those who left it so long ago.Another recurring theme in this collection is that of seeking happiness, through one means or another, and only occasionally finding it. In these stories, characters are looking for something that will make their lives worthwhile, or at the very least a little bit better. In \\"The Long Rain,\\" a group of explorers on Venus want just one thing - to get out of the eternal, unceasing rain that pummels the planet. The Sun Domes are their only shelter, if they can find one before they die or go mad. In \\"No Particular Night or Morning,\\" an astronaut searches for the only thing he can be absolutely sure of in this universe - nothingness.In \\"The Man,\\" a group of interstellar explorers are looking for a being, who may or may not be Jesus Christ, going from planet to planet and always finding themselves just a little bit too late. In \\"The Rocket,\\" a poor junkyard owner wants more than anything to fulfill his dream of showing his children outer space, and manages to do it in a slightly roundabout way. And in \\"Rocket Man,\\" a father tries to find what he really wants - to live among the stars or to stay with his family on Earth, and ultimately realizes that he wants - but cannot have - both.The stories in here are all pretty good, and there were a few I want to touch on in more detail. The one that I took the most notes on was \\"The Other Foot,\\" a tale of Mars and the shocking reversal of racial discrimination. In this story, Mars has been colonized by Black exiles from the United States, sent off-planet in an ultimate act of segregation. After decades of eking out an existence on that harsh planet, they learn that a rocket from Earth - probably containing a white astronaut - is on its way. The community reacts in a knee-jerk fashion, preparing a new apartheid on Mars - re-creating the worst of Jim Crow, only in reverse. When the rocket touches down and announces that nuclear war has destroyed everything the colonists had known and loved about Earth, and that white Americans had come to Mars to beg for the help of its citizens, the mob has a change of heart and decides to let bygones be bygones.As much as I hate post-modernism, I couldn't shut off my critic's voice while reading this story. I wondered if a story about Black oppression written by a white author must automatically be racist in nature, and I wondered if Bradbury's suggestion that Black colonists on Mars would, as a first reaction, try to re-create the worst conditions they had endured on Earth might not be rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of Black culture. Then the Intellectual Machine That Eats Itself (i.e. Postmodernism) began to ask if perhaps these thoughts were rooted in my own unacknowledged racism, at which point I had to just finish the damn story and move on. It's a question that probably wasn't asked fifty years ago, though, which makes the story an interesting one to revisit in our slightly more enlightened age.Another story that I really enjoyed was \\"The Exiles,\\" which has also been titled \\"The Mad Wizards of Mars.\\" In this tale, the great writes of fiction - and their works - are living (where else?) on Mars. There you can find Edgar Allan Poe and Ambrose Bierce living with Charles Dickens and Shakespeare. They're on Mars because Earth has been systematically destroying their works, and thus depriving them of immortality. When a rocket arrives from Earth carrying the last load of books to be destroyed, the fictionauts launch a last-ditch attempt to save themselves. With Poe leading their armies, they pour all of their power into stopping the rocket. Shakespeare's witches fling curses at the astronauts, and Poe summons all the armies of fiction to defend their existence.It's a story that you can tell Bradbury had a lot of fun writing, and is full of wonderful references to the authors he loves. Just the image of Edgar Allan Poe screaming defiance at the air is one that I will treasure every time I read the tale.What's really wonderful about this collection is that it's aged well. Published in 1951, it does suffer from some of the mid-century sci-fi tropes of the day, and modern writers would never be allowed to get away with something like a rainy Venus or humanity calmly accepting the end of the world. But they're still great stories, and well worth the read. So go read 'em.------------------------------------------------------\\"I am a frightened and an angry man. I am a god, Mr. Dickens, even as you are a god, even as we all are gods, and our inventions - our people, if you wish - have not only been threatened, but banished and burned, torn up and censored, ruined and done away with. The worlds we created are falling into ruin.Even gods must fight!\\"- Edgar Allan Poe, \\"The Exiles\\" (Ray Bradbury)------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"'The Illustrated Man' is a collection of futuristic stories by Ray Bradbury. Although the stories stand by themselves, most are set in the near future when Mars is colonized by humans. The stories typically have a humanistic/social angle rather than much in the way of action, although a couple fit decidedly in the horror genre. It is these futuristic horror stories that were most enjoyable.Bottom line: a hit and miss collection of early science fiction stories that, I suppose, might be best left to Ray Bradbury fans. Weak recommendation."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This was the first Bradbury I've ever read, and was much better than that horrible show on cable. Essentially, this is an anthology loosely linked by a wrap-around story involving the titular \\"Illustrated Man\\". A carnival worker laid up by a broken limb, he decided to get fully tatooed in order to get another job. Unfortunately, the artist who turns our hero into a walking canvas is something of a witch. It's peak season for carnivals when, on a later summer afternoon, he meets our narrator...... and there doesn't seem to be a carnival in America that will hire him. His tattoos become living stories when stared at by customers. With spaceships, monsters and other oddities covering every inch of his body, he has become an unwitting page on which Bradbury writes his awesome stories. (None of the fictitious carnival-goers care for the stories since, we're told by the Illustrated Man himself, they all end with the viewer's horrible death). As night falls, the illustrations come alive, and the narrator comes to see tales of:- astronauts forced to confront their doom as they drift in space after their spaceship suddenly explodes (years later, this would be parodied in the movie \\"DarkStar\\".)- a living city built by a race of aliens annihilated by Earthlings and unwittingly discovered by exploring humans;- Human explorers seeking their outpost on Venus where it never stops raining (this was a strangely prophetic take on Vietnam, right down to references to congressional funding for additional outposts)- A mother and son driven to desperation by the occupational hazards of the husband's/father's job as a rocket pilot;- A community of African Americans driven to colonize Mars in an effort to escape earthbound prosecutions now confronts survivors of Earth's last great war;- Tourists who are really refugees from an oppressive future and will do anything to keep from having to back (or forth I guess);- A family in a future age in which artificial intelligence and virtual reality affect almost every aspect of their daily existence (\\"The Veldt\\"; this cautionary and visionary tale of AI and VR run amok seems to have provided the basis for far too many episodes of ST:TNG, none of which have come close to matching its subversive quality.)And other tales of exotic aliens, distant planets, rocket ships and the end of the world. This is what science fiction sounds like when your characters can't mask what's going on with meaningless techno-babble."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I was introduced to this book in middle school and have loved it and recommended it to many people since then, mainly because of the rich storytelling and beautifully crafted imagery that only Ray Bradbury could create. Admittedly, it can be just a little confusing in some places, but there are very few classics that can be read in one sitting and completely understood. One of the best stories, and my personal favorite, is &quot;The Veldt&quot; because virtual reality is no longer the sci-fi topic it was when this story was written. This makes the story all the more chilling, especially considering all the time kids spend in front of the computer and tv! All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read, and I would recommend it to just about anyone over the age of 12 or 13."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Bradbury, like Jules Verne, uses his fiction as a telescope to look far into the future. Then, to remind us of the human element, his words become a microscope, looking deep into our minds and souls. \\"The Illustrated Man\\" combines these tools with chilling effectiveness.Although Bradbury penned these tales over fifty years ago, they still ring with cautionary truth. The prologue and epilogue work as bookends, holding in eighteen stories of apocalyptic and visionary wisdom. Through the moving and shifting tattoos on the illustrated man's back, we see glimpses of the future, full of technology, greed, strife, and the human propensity for selfishness. Collectively, these tales remind us that our relationships will always supercede our computers and rockets. When these elements lose perspective, danger lurks in every corner.Although some of the stories seem dated, \\"The Illustrated Man\\" educates while it entertains. Bradbury is a master of his craft, and this is a masterpiece of science fiction."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"\\"The Illustrated Man\\" is a collection of short stories that are loosely tied together as tattoos on the body of the Illustrated Man. The title character gives the impression that the stories told by his illustrations are so horrid that he cannot retain employment. But as the tales begin, the Illustrated Man becomes silent. As a result, the frame of the short stories never seems complete.The focus of most of the stories is space travel which may disappoint some readers as the theme does not seem to fulfill the horror that is promised. Still, there are several quality tales among this batch. \\"The Long Rain\\" is a realistic telling of a hike to safety on the planet Venus. \\"The Veldt\\" is a tale of a children's toy of virtual reality gone mad. \\"Marionettes, Inc\\" shows characters replacing themselves with robotic counterparts to vacation from their marriage. The final story, \\"The Rocket,\\" is the heart-warming tale of the group. A father creates a trip to space for his children in the adventure.As an early work of Bradbury, it is certainly not among his best. I was disappointed that the Illustrated Man was only used to frame the short stories. I would have loved to have seen parts of his story spread among this short story collection. In this format, it seems a good idea was lost."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of those rare science fiction authors who writes to provoke rather than simply entertain. His short stories, like his novels, are always deeper than they might seem at first glance, and require careful reading if you are going to get the most out of them. Happy endings are supplied only when called for, and for mood, there are few better writers anywhere.The Illustrated Man may just have the finest way of connecting otherwise disparate short stories together that has ever been thought of. We have all seen those who have tattoos, and many of them, if you ask, have stories behind each of their decorations. But what if the stories are real? The setting, therefore, is not a place but a person, a body, a human canvas.The stories themselves are of high quality. Some, like \\"The Long Rain,\\" still resonate; who among us hasn't been caught in a storm that never seems to end? The emerging madness of the characters is haunting, even if the Venus we know today is not the Venus of the story.Other stories are topical for the time of the book and are interesting for that reason. \\"The Other Foot,\\" for example, deals with racial segregation reversed on a future Mars. But of course, the issue of race remains a challenge for Americans even today, and so the story is still relevant.Other works of note include \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" which raises the question of the nature of sin: must it be physical? And the ideas found in \\"The Exiles,\\" about the degree to which fictional characters actually exist (later revisited in fascinating form by Joanne Greenberg in a story from her collectionWith the Snow Queen), raise questions about what it means to be real at all.This is a collection well worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Very interesting book. Never gets dull, as it is really a series of very short stories almost all of them concerning the nature of God.Bradbury comes out strongly against both religious people who are inflexible in their definition of God AND atheists. As an agnostic, I was actually a little irritated with parts of it, but you know, it would be hypocritical of me to expect Christians to take it, but not accept a little bit of criticism myself. So, just read it with a very open mind and a lot of curiosity about the world, and you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is simply a must read for anyone who loves sci-fi. The book is divided up into smaller chapters--\\"stories\\" that are represented in each tatoo on the illustrated man. It is one of Bradbury's best books as is a classic."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a wonderful but slightly confusing novel. Ray Bradbury made the future seem so advanced, but then again very dangerous. In other words, human behavior has not changed very much according to this book. War is not a thing of the past. In fact, it's worse than ever. Our creations will end up getting the best of us and when it comes down to human life, there will be no such thing.As I read some of these intriguing short stories, it reminded me of current and past events. Death, death, and a little more death can be seen everywhere. Whether it is from old age, disease, or in some cases, nuclear warheads: death will always be our shadow. Human nature is inevitable and nothing we build will ever change our ways of living. Some one will always get greedy, someone will always want a little more.My honest opinion about whether or not this book should be required to read (this may sound childish) is no. When I think of summer vacation, I don't think of work. My sugarcoated opinion however slightly differs. I still do not think that it should be required to read because reading a book about mankind's tedious path to doom, to me, foreshadows upcoming events in my English class. Do not get me wrong, the book has its moments, but it's just not the thing I want to read during or before school."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is one of those books that can not be put down. It takes you to those far away places (such as Venus) that you've always dreamed about. You always wonder &quot;where next&quot; and you don't want this book to end. Once this book is opened you believe that the television is on but the words are forming all the pictures. I love how Bradbury put all these wonderful short stories together and only wish that someone would make another collection of other short stories so that the worlds teenagers and adults would have literature that they accually want to read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is so beautiful. Ray Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as &quot;The Veldt,&quot; wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or &quot;Kaleidoscope,&quot; a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Wow!

He showed good tone and mood in all his stories.One of my favorite quotes in the book is in the story called The Rocket Man and the fater says \\"Dont be a rocket man.\\" I know its short but it mean a lot because he said when your out here you want to be out there and when your out there you want to be out here.What i didn't like about the book was some of the stories were to confusing and to me and my opinion some were to boring.

It is from on e of the staories from the ILlustrated Man called \\" The Exiles,\\" which are also one of my favorite stories. However, i won't tell what it is about since it is up to you to find out that this is a good book.If anyone says that this book is bad don't listen to him or her because this book is really good. The one other story i like the best is called, \\"Zero Hour\\" because it is about an invasion by alens so that's why i liked it. If you want to find out more about the future, rockets, planets, or space this is the book for you. The different stoies in here are mostly abou the future and outer space. If you're a teeanger, you should read this book it has the best eighteen stories adn it si really well written.

I dont think this book should be a requirment to read although it was a fair size chapter book i still think it was more likely for a elementery student.Most of the short stories were for kids anyway so i dont think this book should be a requirement for students at this age."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I thought that the illistrated man was a very unique book and i don't necessarely mean that in a good way either. It was too much science fiction, and that's not my preference when it comes to books. One thing this book did have that i liked a lot was that it had some very good morrals, that we could all learn from. My favorite quote from the book was in the epilogue,\\"I stood there in the moonlight,afraid that the windor the stars might move and wake the monstrous gallary at my feet.\\" That quote was my favorite because it shows suspence and fear.Which I kind of liked.I wouln't reacommend this book to any of my friends unless they were really into space, technology, and the future. Basically if they really weren't into science fiction like me it wouldn't be a good book for them. But i do kind of think that this book should be required for students to read because one thing this book shows is how much us humans rely on technology and how its become a big factor in about all of our lives. Which can have a bad outcome. Overall i think that The Illistrated Man was an okay book,nothing that great, but nothing that sucked either."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This tale of adventure and scientific genre is a wonderful imaginative book for children and adults. Thisbook takes place in many times the past,future,and the present. The it goes a man with tattos is in the middle of nowhere and meats a nother dweller where the tatto man or in other words the illustrated man show him nis tattos and how they move and tale storys of the future and space.I was completely satisfied of this book and how Ray Bradbury thought the future would be from his point of view of the 50's. This novel not only tells of one story but a varitey of 18 different storys that teach us 18 different lessons. This story ranges from different time periods ranging from 1975 to 2055 and on. I strongly recommend this book for scientific enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is about a man who is cursed with tatoos that tell the story of the future. In this book, the super technological future is in the 1990's. Most of the stories have to do with space travel and science fiction.The Illustrated Man is a terrific book. I am glad I read it this summer. There is a mix of action suspense and history in the book. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. The only thing holding it back from a perfect 10 is that it wasn't consistent. There would be a very good, high-paced, action or suspense story followed by a story that was, sad to say, boring. None the less, the overall book was great and it showed a sense of imagination to let your mind travel.Though The Illustrated Man was a good book, it wouldn't be necessary to read in schools. It isn't a classic and I wouldn't put in the ranks of To Kill a Moking Bird by Harper Lee or I know Why th Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angeleu. Plus, the book focuses on too many different subjects."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This is a collection of 18 short stories, loosely tied together by the premise of The Illustrated Man, a man whose tattoos move and shift to tell the stories. Some of these stories were published in various magazines between the fall of 1947 and 1951; others first appeared in this collection. This book was ranked 10th on the Astounding Analog All-Time Poll in 1952, and was tied for 22nd on the same poll in 1956. It was ranked 33 on the 1999 Locus All-Time Poll for collections. It was also nominated for the 1952 International Fantasy Award for fiction.Almost all of the stories in this collection are outstanding. There is a wide variety of stories, some are horror, some are fantasy, and some are science fiction. He can create settings like no other author, as the feelings and emotions of the pieces are what set him apart from the rest. This collection stands the test of time."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The most obvious feature that sets this short story collection apart is the morbidity and darkness of it. Almost every story is about something gone horribly wrong. You don't see that too often, I think authors are afraid to write that kind of story, but Bradbury does it well, and has a good way to present the stories (via the illustrated man) that explains why they're morbid.I think two or three were feel good stories. Many revolve around rockets and invaders from Mars, which is completely representative of that wonderful time before the Russians became our big enemy."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of my second hand book. It pays to buy 2nd hand . The service was great. I received my order in a timely fashion. The selection of titles is extensive.I will order again from Amazon."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Well written as a collection of short stories (mainly apocalyptic themes, technology overtaking humanity, rockets in space, etc.) I personally have grown very fond of short stories after getting too involved with several epics.. There's enough excitement in the narrative to engage any reader while artfully threading in heavy philosophical undertones. There's a reality to the way Bradbury crafts his language and sets up each scene. All in all, a good read - a satisfying blend of magical and morbid"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This is the first collection of short stories I have ever read and I was not in the least bit disappointed.I really love that it wasn't just a dumping of stories, Bradbury actually took the time to connect them with the illustrated man.Some of the stories have the ability to remain with you past your initial reading. For me those stories were \\"Zero Hour,\\" \\"The Fox and the Forest\\" and \\"The Rocket.\\" Beautifully crafted and really just a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This group of short stories outshine the rest in its class. On its surface, its a collection of stories that relate to the tattoos on a wandering man. As his new companion looks on, the tattoos come to life and each of them has a powerful story to share.The overall idea for this collection is perfect, and it really works to tie all of the stories together. But the real gems are the stories themselves. In a few short pages Bradbury uses each story to reveal timeless truths about religion, God, race, fear, the future, and much more. The first story, The Veldt, is a haunting tale that highlights the dangers of technology. Written fifty years ago, it is nothing short of prophetic and it perfect for our times.There are a couple of stories that are slower than the rest, but only because the are compared to the other brilliant stories contained in the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This collection of classic sci-fi stories from Ray Bradbury is a little dated, with rocket ships and Martians and a 1950s sensibility (and sex roles). There's no real unifying theme, despite the \\"illustrated man\\" who bears each tale as a tattoo on his body. Most of the stories are dark and more psychological than speculative fiction, Martians and spaceships notwithstanding. Don't expect any of the usual \\"twist\\" endings common to short stories from this time period, but if you're familiar with Bradbury's other work, you'll see his themes reflected here.I found the book moderately enjoyable, but it's not the best introduction to Bradbury, and it's not great sci-fi. Worth a read, but most of the stories just don't hold up well today; they were probably more thrilling and creepy sixty years ago."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"\\"Eighteen illustrations, eighteen tales.\\" \\"The illustrations came to life...\\"A man is encountered who has skin Illustrations all over his body. Each illustration represents a tale from the future. The illustrations come to life and tell a tale of doom or impending doom. In this way ray Bradbury can tell related but different tales in this book. Its Bradbury's writing style and dialogue that holds you as much as the storyline.At first they are intriguing and fresh. Later they don't as much repeat but are similar in form and function.One of the best \\"The Veldt\\" is first. Of course everyone will have a different favorite.I suggest that you make your cats leave the room if you read out loud.The Veldt (Classics Stories of Ray Bradbury)"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This was my introduction to Science Fiction although some of the stories are perhaps more horror/fantasy than science fiction. And yes, there is a lot of unevenness in the quality of the stories - some are really exceptional and haunting and some are over before ever getting started. Truth is, even those are good but they require much more participation on the part of the reader! My only real complaint is that this edition (like most!) does not include, \\"The Playground\\" which is a very powerful story on an aspect of childhood. Why this story does not appear in most editions is beyond me but it's a great read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"this is a great book with vintage stories that will still make your heart beat a little faster...each story is a gem in itself and the book is a real delight!!!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the workings of the human mind. The vehicle - a man covered with illustrations - Bradbury uses to give us insight into the strengths and frailties of the human psyche is ingenious and as always his literary expertise provides for a spell-binding read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"this was my first ray bradbury novel i have ever read and after reading a few of his others...I saw this is the one that makes the most sense..the others were just plain confusing. Anyways, this book is about man with tattoos that come to life and tell stories about the future...its a pretty good book and you should check it out. Don't stop reading after the first story; it's a little demented (to me) but it's still great and i loved it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man was a pretty good book. To me, I had to be in the mood to read it because im not into science fiction. This book is about a man with a whole bunch of tatoos all over him. These tattoos aren't the regular tattoos the ones you see on people. These ones move and have a story to tell. There were eighteen stories on his body that have morals to life.My favorite quote in the book was from the story \\"The Last Night Of The World,\\" \\"What would you do if you knew that this was the last night of the world?\\" This quote was my favorite because it made me excited of what the next story was going to be about. I also think about the end of the world on my own time, so this quote caught my interest. It also made me wonder what if i knew it was the last night of the world, making me want to answer the question and think about it.I think this book should be required reading. This book isn't that bad if you give it a try. It also teaches students morals in the stories. When you read this book your mind also gets to exercise with the kinds of stories in it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is a book full of interesting short stories. Each story is a continuation into a new story, which keeps the reader wanting more. Ray Bradbury has a large variety of topics in which he covers in his short stories &quot; The Other Foot&quot; and &quot;The Man&quot; are short stories that talked about racism and hints around religion, respectively. &quot;The Other Foot&quot; talks about the inequality of black people and how the Lord saw to it that the other race suffered in the end. &quot;The Man&quot; talks about a higher being where the moral is there is always something or someone better than you.The Illustrated Man should be required reading in schools because every story had a moral behind it. And people need to know what good morals really are. This book is good reading for schools because it carries different spectrums of the world, and it can also help kids with their imagination and thinking what can become of the world in the future. This book talks about religion, racism, the future, and etc. Children and teens should know, hear, and see different things of the world today. And all the stories are well set up where you can follow and you are able to learn something from it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I had to read The Illustrated Man for English class over the summer, and I think it's pretty good for science-fiction. The stories teach a lot of useful lessons that make you question how well you are living your life. There are stories about the end of the world and men going out into space.I think this book is good for required reading because of the lessons it teaches. They really are useful and simple to apply to your everyday life."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is an interesting book to say the least. Throughout the entire compilation of 18 short stories Ray Bradbury constantly shows the reader that we as people are capable of good and evil. As humans we have wants and needs, the way we express these emotions are what define us.No matter what decade, past or present, Ray Bradbury continuously portrays individuals in the book as humans and nothing more. We are capable of chaos and destruction however, as long as we can hate we can love and care. These actions are shown in The Illustrated Man by gigantic wars or by an unselfish act to please the person or persons we love most.Like a moth to the flame, I have repeatedly returned to The Illustrated Man for academic aide, as well as personal interest. As a student I would deem this book as memorable but not as material that is capable of being completely reread. Personally I think this book would make an excellent learning tool in school as a book that would be required to be read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a science fiction novel that I have currently read.

I found it very interestng and stimulating to read and I was on the verge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next more then once.

I was just like that and couldn't believe it when I was asked to read a story over my summer vacation. But, since this was an assigned and mandatory assignment I did it anyway. Now, after finishing the novel, I must say I am glad I pushed myself to read a book that really wasn't that long after all. It was something I enjoyed and would do again if I had to. So, I would agree that this should be a required piece of reading for all who are interested. After all, it's not a lot to read and you never know if you may like it or not.

His body is covered in beautifully detailed illustrations that we&#8217;re put on him by a witch. Because of the witch&#8217;s evil powers the man&#8217;s tattoos have the ability to see the future.One of my favorite quotes from the book (which was actually a question) had to be: &#8220;What would you do if you knew that this was the last night of the world?&#8221; When I read that line I honestly stopped and thought, what would I do? There we&#8217;re many other things that happened throughout the book that made you stop and think as well, but you&#8217;ll just have to read the book and find them for yourself!I definitely believe that this book should be required reading, especially for kids of my age. Why? Mainly because it gets us thinking about things we wouldn&#8217;t normally have thought about. Things like the quote I mentioned above. It&#8217;s not a pleasant thought for many people, but it&#8217;s interesting to wander outside your normal thoughts. This book should also be required reading because, well just because it&#8217;s a really good book.

I thought the stories were quite interesting but a little too childish, but as I kept reading on i thought it had good morals and good hooks to keep you reading. It could also could widen your imagination. You could also make a picture of what might happen in the future by reading this book. Most of the stories are taking place in the future and informs you about these great machines.I think Ray Bradbury did a brilliant job on a unigue story format by taking a story and making the reader find out and keep reading. My favorite story was the \\"The Rocket Man\\" because i really enjoyed the story and I couldnt put it down. I definetly would recommend for you to read this book because you would enjoy like I did.

Because it is not just one continous story, the plot is always changing dramatically.At the end of each story you are usually left hanging as to what ends up happening exactly, leaving you with vague ideas and room to use your imagination, keep you thinking, and hungry for more.As thrilling as the book was however, I found it increadably disconcerting. Many othe the stories were frightening, involving death in various ways, and people filled with such uncertainty to the point of doubting their own existence.Such as in the story 'No Particular Night or Morning' where the character Hitchcockthinks that if he can't see something then it can't exist.Despite how the book made me feel it has some good morals that can be learned from and used in life. The Illustrated Man makes readers think and consider how life may be if we take things for granted, and don't take care of what we have.

I counted them one by one. Primarily my eyes focused upon a scene, a large house with two people in it. I saw a flight of vultures on a blazing flesh sky. I saw yellow lions, and I heard voices. The illustrations quivered and came to life.....\\" This is my favorite quote because it is in the prologue and captures you for the stories.I think this book should be read because it is very creative.

My favorite story, and the one that made me think the most was Kaleidescope.It was my favorite because I like space and it made me think about what I wold do if i was in Hollis' position.

I really liked this quote because it showed that not only one but all of us have an end to life.I recommend this novel to those people who like mystery and exciting stories at the same time.

While reading The Illustrated Man, I could always visualize everything that was going on and the mood was always set. This is one of those books that will have you reading throughout the night. I was astounded how well Ray Bradbury was able to create a mood within very few pages. Not once throughout the book did I feel lost or unwilling to finish a certain story. Each one had their own atmosphere, and each kept me reading until I was finished. Although there were not direct quotes that stood out to me, I really liked the story \\"No Particular Night or Morning.\\"I believe that this novel should be on the required reading list. Besides the fact that it is one of the greatest Science Fiction novels I have ever read, it also helps the reader think in new ways. Many of the stories have the reader thinking about choices in life they have made.

Before anyone else did it, he probably did it. He set the standards by which all else is still judged. And The Illustrated Man is supposed to be among his best works.Only I didn't like it. I liked the set up-- the man covered in tattoos that come to life (so to speak), with each one a short story in the book. But too many (the vast majority) were too depressing without any offer of hope. Granted, Bradbury was writing these stories in the wake of World War II, so he had good cause to be pessimistic. But every story seems to be a case of meeting a character we like/dislike, something really bad happens to them, the end. No hope for even a positive outcome.\\"The Veldt\\" starts it off. And it is one of the great classics. And I like the story, despite the horror of it. But it's followed by story after story where things end just as badly.One very interesting exception (and there are a few exceptions in the book), is \\"The Other Foot.\\" Written before most people were even thinking about Civil Rights, it's about a thriving community on Mars comprised of black people who escaped oppression on Earth. Now, rockets with white people are set to arrive, and everyone is determined to treat them exactly as they themselves were treated on Earth-- separate drinking fountains, back of the bus, and interestingly, a minimum wage-- while others are already making nooses... only, it doesn't end up in bloodshed, and it is the rare bit of hope in the book."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I have found over the years that Bradbury is a better novel writer than a short story writer.

Ray Bradbury includes in all his short stories, his hidden sanctimonious Christian ethics. He spreads his tedious message in little spurts here and there. I was expecting science fiction but found nothing of the sort.\\"The Veldt\\" -- Two parents use an artificial \\"nursery\\" to keep their children happy. The children use the high-tech simulation nursery to create the predatorial environment of the African veldt. When the parents threaten to take it away, the children lock their parents inside where they are mauled and killed by the \\"harmless\\" machine-generated lions of the nursery.\\"Kaleidoscope\\" -- A bitter astronaut feels he has accomplished nothing worthwhile in his life as he and the rest of his crew fall irrevocably to their demise in outer space because of a malfunction in their ship. The story illustrates the collapse of the sanity and logic of the crew members as they face their death. Ultimately, the lamenting narrator is incinerated in the atmosphere of the Earth and appears as a shooting star to a child after wishing that his life would at least be worth something for someone else.\\"The Other Foot\\" -- Mars has been colonized solely by black people. When they learn that a rocket is coming from Earth with white travelers, they institute a Jim Crow system of racial segregation in which white people are to be considered second-class citizens, in retaliation for the history of wrongs perpetrated on their race by white people. When the rocket lands, the traveler tells them that most of the Earth has been destroyed in a war and asks for their help. The people realize that discrimination is harmful in all its forms, and reverse their planned segregation.\\"The Highway\\" -- A simple-minded family living by a highway in rural Mexico go on living their normal, idyllic lives as the highway fills with people fleeing a nuclear war. The story ends with some travellers they help telling them about the nuclear war, and how the world is ending. After the travelers leave, the confused resident briefly wonders what \\"the world\\" is, and then continues with his life.\\"The Man\\" -- A group of space explorers land on a planet to find the population living in a healthy state of bliss. Upon investigation, they discover that an enigmatic visitor came to them. Further description leads the two spacemen to believe that this man is Jesus (though he is never named, leaving room for other religious personas). One decides to spend the rest of his days on the planet, living and rejoicing in the wake of the man's glory. The other continues in his spaceship, \\"chasing 'him' always a step behind, never fast enough to catch up to him, constantly trying to achieve the unachievable.\\" Other members of the crew decide to stay on the planet to learn from the contented citizens, and are rewarded by the discovery that \\"he\\" is still on the planet.\\"The Long Rain\\" -- A group of astronauts are stranded on Venus, where it rains continually and heavily. The travelers make their way across the Venusian landscape to find a \\"sun dome\\", a shelter with a large artificial light source. However, the first sun dome they find has been destroyed by the Venusians. Searching for another sun dome, the characters, one by one, are driven to madness and suicide by the unrelenting rhythm of the rain. At the end of the story, only one sane astronaut remains, and manages to find a functional sun dome.\\"The Rocket Man\\" -- An astronaut's job keeps him away from home for long stretches of time, so he has little time with his wife and son, only visiting them for a period of three days at a time. The story is told from the perspective of the son, who holds an interest in becoming an astronaut too. However, his father explains to him that while the stars are beautiful, what he really wants is to be with his family. Sensing that his wife is unhappy with him being at home so little, the father makes a promise to the son that he will be quitting his job after his next mission to spend more time with them. At the end of the story, the son and his mother learn that his ship fell into the sun, and from then on, they do not venture outside during the day in remembrance of him.\\"The Fire Balloons\\" -- A priest travels to Mars to act as a missionary to Martians. Once there, he discovers that the natives are actually entities of pure energy. Since they lack corporeal form, they are unable to commit sin, and thus do not need redemption. Another message Bradbury conveys through this short story is that the vision of God is the same as that of his worshippers.\\"The Last Night of the World\\" -- In this story, the entire planet awakens to the knowledge that the world is going to end that very evening. Nonetheless, they go through their normal routines of going to work, eating, brushing their teeth, and falling asleep, knowing and accepting the fact that they will not wake up. This is in strong contrast to the looting and riots typically expected in this situation.\\"The Exiles\\" -- Numerous works of literature are banned and burned on Earth. The fictional characters of these books are portrayed as real-life entities who live in a refuge on Mars. However, they are vulnerable, as when all the books on a character are destroyed, the character itself vanishes permanently. When the group of characters learn that some people are coming for them, they stage a counterattack, but are foiled by the astronauts who burn the last remaining books from Earth, unknowingly annihilating the entire colony.\\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" -- Two men in a spaceship are having a discussion about how empty and cold space is. The first man is a little bit insane and keeps asking questions about how there is nothing sure in space and there is no night or morning. He refuses to believe anything about reality without sufficient evidence and soon becomes skeptical of everything he cannot directly experience. He said that he doesn't believe in stars because they are too far away. The second man is wandering about the ship when he learns that someone has left the ship, and it is the first man. The first man is still talking to himself and has killed himself by letting himself fly freely through space.\\"The Fox and the Forest\\" -- A couple from the future tires of the war in their modern lives, so they go on a vacation to the more serene past in an attempt to escape with the help of a company called \\"Travel in Time, Inc.\\" They go to Mexico in 1938, but are pursued by a government agent who forces them to come back to 2155.\\"The Visitor\\" -- This story takes place on Mars, which is used as a quarantine for people with deadly illnesses. One day, the planet is visited by a young man of eighteen who has the ability to perform thought transference and telepathy. The exiles on the planet are thrilled with his ability and a violent fight breaks out over who will get to spend the most time with their visitor. In the struggle, the young man is killed and the escape he provided is lost forever. Because of the man's abilities, it is possible that he caused the men to hallucinate his injury, or even the entire struggle, and escaped when they believed him to be dead. The facts that he encouraged the fighting and seemed calm and amused throughout the story points to this outcome. Regardless, he is dead to the people of Mars.\\"The Concrete Mixer\\" - A reluctant Martian soldier is forced to join the army as they prepare to invade Earth. However, when they arrive, they are welcomed by a world at peace, full of people who are curious rather than aggressive. The protagonist meets a movie director, and it becomes clear that the people of Earth have planned to exploit the Martians for financial gain. He tries to escape back to Mars, but is run over by a car and killed.\\"Marionettes, Inc.\\"-A man attempts to escape his marriage by replacing himself with a robot to fool his wife into thinking he hasn't left and tells a friend about it. The man comes back and tells the robot to go back into the box, and the robot disobeys him saying he has fallen in love with the wife. The robot then proceeds to put the man in the box and goes to visit the wife. Later, the friend discovers that his wife has left and that he has been living with a robot version of her.\\"The City\\" -- A rocket expedition from Earth lands on an uncharted planet to be greeted by a seemingly empty City. As the humans begin to explore, they realize that the City is not as empty as it seems. The City was waiting for the arrival of humans; the contingency plan of a long dead civilization, put in place to take revenge upon Humanity after their culture was wiped out with biological weapons by humans long before recorded history. Once the City captures and kills the human astronauts, the humans' corpses are used as automatons to finalize The City's creators' revenge; a biological attack on the Earth.\\"Zero Hour\\" -- Children across the country are deeply involved in an exciting game they call 'Invasion'. Their parents think it's cute until it turns out that the invasion is real and aliens are using the children to help them get control of Earth.\\"The Rocket\\" -- Fiorello Bodoni, a poor junkyard owner, has managed to save $3,000 to fulfill his lifelong dream of sending one member of his family on a trip to outer space. The family, however, finds it impossible to choose who will go because those left behind will inevitably envy the chosen one for the rest of their lives. Bodoni instead uses the money to build a replica rocket from an old mock-up, and sets up a 3D theater inside the cabin and convinces the children they are actually going through space."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"\\"Prologue: The Illustrated Man\\" and \\"Epilogue\\" are used as a binding element for this short story collection, linked together by images on the Illustrated Man's skin.The name of \\"The City\\" was and is Revenge, upon the planet of Darkness - and after 20 millennia of waiting, Earthmen have come calling.\\"The Concrete Mixer\\" Ettil objects to the Martian invasion of Earth - he's been reading illegally imported Earth fiction, and knows how all such invasions end.Meet \\"The Exiles\\" - the reverse image of Bradbury's \\"Usher II\\".\\"The Fire Balloons\\" Father Peregrine and his colleagues have come to Mars as missionaries to the Martians.

The drivers always complain - until today, as they flee the atom-bombing of the cities.\\"Kaleidoscope\\" Although the crew were spacesuited when the ship was torn open, none had propulsion units - so here they are, falling, scattered so that they mostly can't see each other, unable to do anything except talk to pass their last few hours. (One twist is that they aren't all caught by Earth's gravity - some go one way, some another.)On \\"The Last Night of the World\\", all the adults *know*, from having had the same dream, that the end has come.

Hart's first reaction is to ask if his competitors have beaten him here. :) ('I sympathize, Martin. I overlook your petty insubordination.' 'I don't overlook your petty tyranny.') Hart is driven to go on and on, so much so that he can't quite recognize what he's been looking for.\\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" Unlike _I Sing the Body Electric!_, here robots are illegally sold as replicas of specific people.

Doug's mother treats space as though it doesn't exist, wanting her husband to stay and have a life with his family - hard, knowing that you can see all the places where he's been, while they're forever out of reach.\\"The Veldt\\" - The Hadleys live in the kind of automated-to-the-max house seen in \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" in _The Martian Chronicles_. The adults worry that the nursery, with its full-sensory storytelling experiences, has supplanted them in their children's hearts - and what with the African stories they've been reading lately, the screams coming from the lions' kills are unnerving.\\"The Visitor\\" - Victims of 'blood rust' are permanent exiles quarantined on Mars, and they suffer most from homesickness. When a newcomer displays a gift for creating illusions of home, though, whose home will it be?\\"Zero Hour\\" - Children under nine have suddenly taken up a new game: invasion.

There is a common whimsical element in all the stories that I found enjoyable, even if most of the stories don't have happy endings. When I read a story, I had no idea where Bradbury is leading to until the last page or so. I always felt a \\"gotcha\\" feeling behind each tale.

Also I felt that he is warning about the people who are trusting science so deeply. For instance, he is warning an atomic war, which he wrote in his book.

Once I read about three paragraphs into each story I was able to tell if the story was going to be enjoyable or not.I thnk this would be a pretty ok book to read durring down time. This novel would be interesting to all types of readers, not to just science fiction readers. I enjoyed it because of the suspese. I also like how the author wrote the novel in many stories. It was confusfing at first, but when I started to read it more I started to think more about it.

The stories are mostly cerebral, although you shouldn't expect hard science. Mars and Venus as depicted in these stories contradict what we now know about these planets, but these inaccuracy are largely irrelevent since the themes in many of the stories don't require a science fiction setting. Although it's easy to tell the stories were written fifty years ago, the stories themselves aren't really dated, but it is amusing to read a story where the author didn't put a technology far enough into the future to avoid the popularity of his work. Overall, it's a good book but it doesn't fall into the category of a must read. If you have trouble finding time to read, this is a perfect book for reading a story or two and then putting away for a while without losing any continuity."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"My first Bradbury book was \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", which I read for English class as a sophomore. Upon finishing it, I immediately rushed out to the nearest Half-Price bookstore and bought a truckload of his books.

And although I read it cover to cover in one afternoon, I felt as though I had been enlightened.Granted, this is Bradbury in his so-called \\"Forties Period\\", in which most of his stories dealt with killer babies, end-of-the-world scenarios, and general all-around nihilism. But, boy, is it fun! Personal favorites are \\"The Man\\", \\"The Highway\\", \\"The Other Foot\\", and \\"The Long Rain\\". I don't happen to like \\"The Veldt\\" all that much, but that's just me. But my favorite of all of these is \\"The Last Night On Earth\\", which actually made me smile and say, \\"aww...\\". My least favorite is \\"The Exiles\\", which for some reason didn't sit well with me at all, which I think is just because I'm a booklover (just in case I haven't already made that clear).

But even with his loss, Ray Bradbury will continue to be read and enjoyed by many fans, as well as be discovered by new readers for the first time. The Illustrated Man is an excellent example for those looking to give Ray Bradbury a try and find out just how good he is.The book is told with the framing story of the illustrated man - a man covered in tattoos that when stared at by others come to life and tell their own stories. Stories of a future high-tech nursery where children play amongst real animals, but when their parents threaten to take this supreme toy away, they have a plan to take care of them once and for all. A story of a future Mars colonized by black people, but now Earth is on the brink of obliteration and the white man needs a new place to live; will the colonists of Mars allow this immigration? There is the moving story of \\"The Rocket Man\\" who loves his wife and son ever so much, but continues to feel the yearning pull of space and can never remain on Earth too long. In \\"The City\\" some space travelers discover an abandoned city on a planet, but as they search through it, it seems the city is not uninhabited after all.The stories in The Illustrated Man will move you, they'll make you laugh, they'll make you cry; they'll make you terrified and also make you think about the way your world is and about the way it might one day be.

He allows the more subtle message of the stories to come through by taking the edge off the sensationalism.It is particularly interesting to read these stories and rember (or discover) what life was like in the fifties and then reflect (investigate) what changes took place in the subsequent fifty year.For those who have read this and didn't like it try it again in a few years."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I think overall this book, The Illustrated Man, was one of the best books I ever read. It was funny and very easy to read and understand, which for me is a good thing because I don't really like to read books that are hard to follow. I also liked how it was about a man who has tattoos all over his body and each one tells a story about someone's life. My favorite story out of this book would have to be the Veldt and also Marionettes Inc. They both had a more twisted end to them and were almost unreal but I really enjoyed reading both of them.

Not all of the stories here are classics, but a surprising number of them are. A few are Mars stories that didn't quite fit into the overall narrative structure of The Martian Chronicles, but are very good and make good additions to this set---for example \\"The Other Foot\\", in which Bradbury anticipated the civil rights movement by a decade or so (much like his pal Hugh Hefner, who originally published Fahrenheit 451 in the early issues of Playboy) by positing a situation in which blacks (having been sent to Mars first) constitute a majority and whites a minority. There is also \\"The Exiles\\", a tale of censorship which prefigured Fahrenheit 451.Some other highlights include \\"Kaleidoscope\\", about a group of astronauts drifting through space to their deaths after their rocket explodes; \\"No Particular Night or Morning\\", about how deep philosophical skepticism ultimately amounts to solipsism and leads to death; and \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\", a very funny about the consequences of using a robot double to do your dirty work for you...actually it's really hard to pick standout stories, as several of the others are very good too.There are a couple of stinkers as well, though, in particular \\"The Man\\", a really ludicrous story about Jesus visiting other planets after Earth...but on the whole, this is a solid collection of material from Bradbury, and well worth reading if you haven't already, and re-reading if you already have!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"One of Bradbury's more famous short story collections, The Illustrated Man gathers a variety of classic RB tales, with several focusing on Mars and its settlement, and many others dancing around the science-fictional or the fantastic. Here's commentary on a few I like:There are several stories that turn on the viciousness or uncontrolled wildness of children. \\"The Veld,\\" \\"Zero Hour,\\" and \\"The Playground\\" all imply that children have a brutal streak we don't like to think about.My favorite stories in the collection are those that ponder the life of the everyman in the world of the future. The best of these is \\"The Rocket,\\" but almost as good are \\"The Highway\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World.\\"Bradbury also likes to contemplate the vast terror of space itself, as in \\"Kaleidoscope\\" -- a story about men set adrift when their ship was hit by an asteroid, and the slowly fading radio contact they share. \\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" touches on some of the same themes.\\"Usher II\\" is perhaps the strangest story in the collection. Set in the same world as both the Mars stories and Fahrenheit 451, it tells of an eccentric oligarch who builds a replica of Poe's House of Usher, and fills it with traps from other Poe stories. An odd tale, but amusing.I have to say, though, I was disappointed not to see the story that provides the title of the conclusion become a tale in its own right--the adventures of the eponymous character on whom all the other stories take place was primed to be my favorite tale, at least until it turned out not to be told.All in all, an excellent collection.

All of these stories are classic Ray Bradbury -- full of spacemen, Earth-Mars conflict, psychiatrists, spoiled children, bad marriages, book burning, domestic work-saving technologies, and nervous breakdowns. They deal with the fear of atomic war, loneliness, prejudice, madness, and the dangers of automobiles, junk food, and media entertainment (but smoking is okay).All of the tales are written in Bradbury's incomparable prose and most of them are emotionally touching. But, not surprisingly, they're almost all grim, making The Illustrated Man a book that you probably won't want to read all at once unless you want to have your own book-burning nervous breakdown.My favorites are:* \\"The Veldt\\" -- a father and mother are concerned about the reality of their kids' virtual games.* \\"Kaleidoscope\\" -- a man reflects on his life as he spins toward Earth after his rocket blows up.* \\"The Other Foot\\" -- black people living on Mars prepare for a visit from white men.* \\"The Man\\" -- spacemen land on a new planet and wonder what important event could have overshadowed their arrival.* \\"The Rocket Man\\" -- a boy and his mom receive a rare visit from his Rocket Man father.* \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" -- a dissatisfied husband purchases a clone so he can escape to Rio for a month without his wife knowing.* \\"The Rocket\\" -- about the best father in the world.This is a great collection (by Tantor Audio) for Bradbury fans who'd like to listen to his stories.

Bradbury came up with the theme of linking them through the Illustrated Man idea, which is very imaginative but doesn't quite tie them together closely enough. Still, there is real magic in the stories, perfect gems of sci-fi that stand on their own and can enthrall a child's mind and even an adult's. I remember reading with the greatest excitement 40 years ago and the stories stand today, though I have since moved on to more mature sci-fi writers, such as Octavia Butler and Frank Herbert.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"\\"The Illustrated Man\\" is one book that I have been wanting to read for quite awhile.

The guy IS \\"amazing\\"!The fact that all these stories were written before 1952 is really \\"amazing\\"!Ray Bradbury's obession with space, astronauts, Mars, peoples overall greed, laziness & reliance on computers/technology in the future were rampant throughout all the stories, but he makes it work well, as usual.Personally I'm not a big fan of science fiction or space stories, but these stories draw in you easily.The book has 18 individual stories, the prologue, the very last story in the book, which is titled \\"The Illustrated Man\\" and the epilogue are only three times the (illustrated man) is mentioned.The stories are all individuals, they don't run together to make one final story or anything.A few of the stories are so, so, but there were several that after reading them, I was left thinking, WOW!, they are:KaleidoscopeThe Other Foot (5 star quality)The Man (5 star quality)The Long RainThe Fox and the ForestMarionettes, Inc.The City (5 star quality)Zero HourI really don't know how Ray Bradbury slept peacefully with all these stories and all the other stuff he wrote swirling around in his mind.The only other Bradbury book I have read is \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", which was also really thought provoking and good.Looking forward to reading more of Ray Bradbury's novels when I get the chance......"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Ray Bradbury is always a delight. While I'm a huge fan of his (sparse few) novels, it's impossible to deny that where he really shines is in his copious short works. He is, in my opinion, one of the 20th Century's great short story writers.The Illustrated Man plucks a character from Something Wicked This Way Comes and uses him as a set of bookends for this collection of 18 short stories. Like any such collection, there are high points and low points. The low points - the story about famous authors dying as their books are burned, for instance - are still fairly solid, though far from classics, while the high points - the rains on Venus, the father who is always away in his rocket, the astronauts floating to their deaths in space, the poor man and his fake rocket, the telepathic man among the sick exiles, the alien invasion via children - are high points indeed. Very, VERY high points.Bradbury never fails to impress. This is an excellent collection full of rich ideas, wonderful languages and stories you'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This is a marvelous collection of stories in which Bradbury offers glmipses of human nature as only he can. His style and prose are at the highest level and the characters stay with you. This book is not quite as strong as \\"Martian Chronicles\\" in my opinion, but is still better than anything most other authors could produce. Bradbury fans and newcomers alike will devour this volume. It is worth the price of the book just to read \\"Kaleidoscope,\\" a remarkable story that has been acted out by countless high school literature and drama classes across the nation. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The short stories, for the most part, in this book, are engaging and very interesting. Towards the middle of the book 2 or 3 stories were a bit stale, compared to the rest; but the majority of stories were excellent and engaging reads"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I first read this book in high school and loved it. \\"The Long Rain\\" is probably my favorite story, followed closely by \\"The Veldt\\". Whether the stories are set in the farthest reaches of outer space or on Earth, the melancholy and often terrible side of humanity generally takes center stage."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"although i cannot get through most Ray Bradbury books, I can definitely get through this one. I've read this book probably around 4 times in 5 years and it truly is a masterpiece. It's one of those books where if you don't have anything else to read, you'll always have it to go back to. Most times I don't read it all the way through but it doesn't matter. It's really really really good. Don't pass it by. BUY IT. really"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I can't believe I have never read Ray Bradbury before. \\"The Illustrated Man\\" is a collection of eighteen short stories tied together with a linking theme. The stories are linked by the actual Illustrated Man, who has designs scrawled all over his body that represent tales beyond your imagination. Although Bradbury is famous for his eerie ways of writing, many of these stories are thought-provoking and heartbreaking, but are still filled with science fiction wonder. The tales range from scary (\\"Marionettes Inc.\\") to downright depressing (\\"The Long Rain\\"). The book is amazingly addicting, and is perfect for science fiction and fantasy readers."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is my second favorite book by Ray Bradbury (Martian Chronicles being the first). I have read it countless times and will continue to do so. I could never get bored with it or anything Bradbury has written for the simple fact that reading his stories is a chance to see something terrible and dark and yet fascinating and beautiful. Getting kinda zen there. Bradbury does that to you. The Illustrated Man, like The Martian Chronicles, is more a short story collection woven together by a central theme. Here we have The Illustrated Man...not tattooed, but illustrated. The illustrations were done by a witch and he has been on the road searching for her ever since she put them on evey inch of his flesh. And when he finds her...he's going to kill her. Why? Because the illustrations move, they are magic, and if you watch for any length of time, they'll tell you a story.\\"The Veldt\\" is probably my favorite here, as is \\"The Long Rain.\\" \\"The Other Foot.\\" \\"The Highway.\\" \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" So many great stories ranging from Sci-Fi to horror to whatever it is that Bradbury weaves for us.Dig it!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Not that Bradbury's work needs any more reviewing, but this is one of my favorite short story collections. While the stories themselves are fantastic as always, the narrative which ties together the book is the most intriguing story of them all. The end of this book always makes me shiver, just a little, a power no other author has over his craft and readers.Second only to Fahrenheit 451, this book should be in classrooms, libraries, and homes everywhere."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This fine collection of short stories is my favorite by Bradbury. Bradbury writes humanistic stories with a poet's heart, using the sci-fi genre to place people into circumstances not otherwise possible in the here and now. By putting people into alien surroundings, Bradbury can render the human essence - sometimes noble and other times ignoble. Each of the stories comes alive in turn and exhibits a different aspect of humanity."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This work from the greatest writer of science fiction's golden age contains legendary stories end to end. Set on the earth of the past, present and future, as well on a host of foreign worlds in the most distant reaches of space, Bradbury offers up a full range of tales from scary musings about mortality and human destiny, to fantastic glimpses into the reality that might lie ahead. Bradbury's imagination caresses the written word and gives his creations a power that won't be found anyplace else. The Illustrated Man is a life-affirming vote of confidence that (for good or for ill) other ages of man are yet to come."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a great science fiction book. I like this book because it takes you away into stories that can relate to your own life. You can largely relate to this book even though it is sci-fi.Brad Bury deeply describes the imagery and details of this book to make the stories connect with you in a way other books might not. I also like this book because it has a futuristic touch to it and it kinda foreshowdows our own future.If you are into sci-fi books, i strongly recomend you reading this book."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated man I about a man who has tattoos all over his body and at night they come to life and tell stories. These stories are like a video that show what's going to happen in the future. Some of these events were horrific and some were quiet humorous but they all told of the events that were to come.I didn't like the book much it was confusing and it was always changing settings and characters. I also disliked how every story left you in a cliffhanger. I also didn't like the fact that the book didn't have a definite climax which in my opinion is essential to a good book. I happen to like fiction books but the illustrated man was just bizarre. I don't really qualify this book as a novel. It's more like and anthology of fictional stories. I don't think it should be required reading because like I said before it's more of an anthology.Even though I didn't like the book I do have to admit that it did have some outstanding features such as its extensive use of imadry and imagination. When I read the book I would get lost in it. It was as if I was rite there in the story and it was very good w/ the imagination.My two favorite stories were \\"The Long Rain\\" and \\"Marionettes Inc.\\"The reason I liked the long rain is because it has such a great sensory details that really actually made me feel I was on Venus with the crew. I liked Marionettes INC. because it was the only story that I found comical.In conclusion I believe that The Illustrated Man should not be required reading. Nevertheless I still recommend it to people."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Perhaps one of the most interesting books I have ever read, The Illustrated Man is the captivating story describing eighteen illustrations inhibited on a man's body. Each of these eighteen tales are so interesting that you won't want to put the book down, and that is an honest opinion. I was hesitant at first about enjoying this book, mainly because I have never read a science fiction novel before, but the use of science is almost unnoticeable. To explain, a lesson seems to be just as easily and commonly learned on unknown Mars as it is on our familiar Earth. For those science-shy readers like myself, the first tale might seem odd since it involves futuristic machines; but as the story progresses, a living city on Venus is nothing new or weird to read about.You would not have to ask twice if I recommend this book. I definitely believe The Illustrated Man should be required reading as well for the reason that it opens your eyes to distinct styles of writing. Many books have become classics due to their captivating storylines, lovable characters, suspenseful climaxes, and breath-taking endings, but this book should be considered a classic for its uniqueness alone.In conclusion, reading can take you anywhere, and Ray Bradbury definitely proves it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man was a journey into the future. It gave us ideas on what the world would soon become. It dealt with real life issues such as, war, nuclear bombs, and death. It explained to us that the way we are living now will soon cause the world to be a far worse place then it should be.Ray Bradbury brought its reader to places other than earth. He brought us to Venus, Mars, and put us in the middle of a meteor shower. His imagination reached new heights that many authors are not capable of reaching.The Illustrated Man was a sensational read that encouraged your mind to think pass the boundaries of logic and into fantasies. Ray Bradbury wrote in a way that gave the illustrated man life. You could see the stories unfold and take place. You could see the parents die in \\"The Veldt\\" and feel the constant rain hit you on Venus in \\"The Long Rain\\". That is why The Illustrated Man should be required reading because it worked your mind in a way that was educational and interesting.by: Jade Green"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The book The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is about a man who has 18 different \\"illustrations\\" tattooed on his body. Each story is unique in its own way. Most of the stories deal with outer space, planets such as Mars and Venus. At night each illustration moves and displays its fascinating, interesting story about the future.I don't have a favorite quote from the book, but I do have a favorite story. My favorite story was \\"Marionettes Inc\\". It was my favorite story because it kept you guessing throughout the whole story. The ending was unexpected and shocking. When I read the last page of the short story it made me want to know what would happen next! I was wishing Mr. Bradbury had done a \\"Marionettes Inc. 2\\"! I definitely enjoyed every second of the story. Personally I think it was one of the most attention grasping stories out of the 18 stories.I do not think this book should be required to read for school because it is not a genre that everyone is interested in. At times the stories were interesting and made you want to turn the pages to find out what would happen next to the characters. But, honestly at times I felt like there was too much death. It seemed like all the stories would display negativity, gruesome deaths, and OUTER SPACE!! The majority of the short stories were about Mars and aliens. So, if you're science-fiction fan, then The Illustrated Man is the book for you!!!!! :)"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury was a very interesting science fiction book. When by ninth grade english teacher told me that I had to read a science fiction book, I thought that it was going to be boring. This book was very interesting and also very easy to understand. Bradbury taught me from this book that life is never easy and there is going to be many struggles, but you just have to get through them. I really enjoyed this book.I think that this book should be required reading, because many students think that science fiction books are not interesting. But, many students never take the time to read a science fiction book. The Illustrated Man also teaches a lot of great points that could be used in life. Ray Bradbury taught me that there will be stuggles in life, but you just have to get through them. I think this book should be required reading and I that overall this book was really good."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a book that is consisted of 18 different short science fiction stories. The 18 short stories are illustrated on a mans body. The stories become alive at night and tell the future. The stories mainly deal with hatred, death, and technology.I didn't exactly have a favorite quote from this book, though there were some that got my attention that i liked. One quote that I liked was \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Don't start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\"(p.106) I liked that quote because I can relate to it.Some of the stories that stood out to me that i liked were \\"The Veldt\\", \\"The Other Foot\\", and \\"The Rocket Man\\". Those stories had interesting conflicts and showed the nature of human kind. Even though the book was good it had a lot of stories about space and martians and the stories didn't exactly relate to one another but each story did have a good moral. Some stories were more interesting that others but I recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Jenavie Ban Gahr High SchoolThe Illustrated Man isn't like any other book I've ever read before. It is full of fantasy stories, and some are even depressing. I didn't really enjoy it because it's not in range of my interest. Also, the format of the book is short story, and i'd rather stick to a novel with only one story.The thing I liked about this book is the different morals in each stories. I don't favor any quotes in the book, but i like one moral of a story, and that is to live life to the fullest. I would recommend this book to be read in school because not everyone reads a book like this, and it's a good experience for students to read different kinds of books. Maybe they'll end up liking it and it can motivate them to read more of these fantasy stories."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book definitely had some interesting ideas about space and the future. Some of the ideas were really futuristic and I wondered if they could really happen, but the stories had main points that were obvious through the storyline. I loved how Bradbury used these futuristic stories to bring out important issues like racism and greed. In \\"The Other Foot\\" he showed how carried away people can get with technology; they started killing the other and basically destroyed Earth. He also showed that we can always get over our differences when the blacks showed compassion to the white man.My favorite story would probably be \\"The Fire Balloons\\" because the aliens turned out to be good and the Fathers had planned to minister to them, but had an important lesson taught to them instead. I wonder if that's really what aliens look like, or if they exist. If they did exist,would we look like them when we landed on their planet? Would they be violent or nice?I liked the way Bradbury wrote the book with individual stories, because he made you think about the meaning of each story. If he had used chapters that related to each other, we would think less about different ideas and think more about the same idea. This book made me want to read his other books. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is about man with illustrations all over his body that move and each one tells a story which make up the eighteen chapters in the book. Every story is different some more interesting than the others. I thought stories like \\"The Veldt\\", \\"The Highway\\", \\"The Other Foot\\", and \\"The Rocket Man\\" had interesting plots and conflicts. The character developments were captivating and so were the conflicts.I thought that this novel is one of the most intriguing science fiction books I have read. Although I didn't like or agree with some stories like \\"the Last Night of The World\\" because who would actually not panic and have a normal day with their family knowing that they are going to die with in 24 hours. \\"The Fire Balloons\\" was ridiculous because that the priests thought they have to preach Christianity to Martians but what if they don't believe in it and what if they have their own religions and the priests should not have the right convert the Martians. The Martians should have the right to choose to believe Christianity.Although I am a huge fan of science fiction I honestly think that this book should not be on the required reading list because I found this book mundane and I felt Bradbury had to many stories about Martians."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The book, The Illustrated Man is an exquisite and unique novel written by Ray Bradbury. It's about a man who has tattoos all over his body. There's a catch. The tattoos move at night to tell the future. There are eighteen stories in this book. Stories about death, war and the technology that there will be in the future.Personally, I don't have a favorite story in the book. All of them had meaning and reached out to me. They talked about the future and I was skeptical about this at first because with all that technology it could make life so much easier and people wouldn't be able to experience the mistakes that they need in order to live their lives to the fullest. But towards the end of the story it creates war, hatred, and morality. Not that I'm for those things, but that's how the world actually goes.\\"What would you do if you knew this was the last night of the world?\\", is my favorite quote from the book because it actually got me thinking about what I would do if I knew that the world was ending tomorrow. It got me thinking if I actually lived today to the fullest. There would be SO many things that I would not get to fulfill and so many things that I wasn't able to tell so many people. I think I liked it the most because it actually got me wondering.I think that this book should be required reading because it contains alot of morals on life. I learned several lessons from this novel. It's hard to understand at times but definately a good read. I would reccomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Bradbury reigns as the quintessential craftsman of sci fi literature in the 50's. This anthology represents stories which were published in several periodicals, mostly set in the distant future. The locale ranges from Earth to Mars and Venus, or just anywhere out in space. We witness Invasions from both points of view: Earth being invaded and Earth men as the invaders. He presents different ways Earth men use the planets, as well as the concept of Christianity in alien worlds. Some tales deal with time travel and a few would make wonderful \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes.The introductory tale, which provides the name for the anthology as a whole, is grimly completed in a brief Epilogue. A traveler in what might be a Depression era encounters a strange man along the dusty road and offers to share his supper with him. He winds up spending the night in the open with this weirdly decorated man, who admits that he is shunned even by carnivals-where freaks are usually welcomed. His entire body is covered with colorful and bizarre tattoos--which he has spent a lifetime trying to remove. What is the curse of these odd illustrations, which cause normal men to send him away or rush off screaming in horror?This is Vintage Bradbury, who inspired a generation of sci fi writers. His fantastic imagination and knowledge of human behavior combine to produce entertaining trips to realms of fantasy and science fiction. After the odd sightings and rumors regarding Roswell in the late 1940's, America was poised on the frontier of space exploration. Thus Bradbury's anthology and an armchair provided readers with their own rocket ship to the skies. Although these tales precede the term \\"Astronaut,\\" this author will effortlessly launch you into astral realms of fancy and the inner sanctum of the human soul. Fortunately the innate qualities that make us Human are still present even in the 22nd century."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"These are stories that go beyond &quot;science fiction.&quot; The technology aspects are part of the canvas, but these stories are powerful because Bradbury paints with emotion and metaphor. He builds more empathy with characters in a few short words than other authors do in an entire novel, and his descriptions return us to a time when we were young, and simple objects filled us with awe and wonder.There is something here for everyone. Read them for yourself. Read them for your children. This short book is a celebration of the art of storytelling."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"i read this book in 4 days! it's a truely moving book! it's honestly one of the best books i have ever read. ray bradbury really pinpoints the human condition in this masterful collection of short stories! i would read this book over and over again. i deffinatly reccomend it for anyone that is a fan of brabury's work or even a fan of science fiction. i have reccomended this book to everyone i know, and you would be seriously missing out if you never read it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The book I am reviewing is The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury.

Some of the stories are first rate because they deal with the timeless themes of human nature. The Veldt (the first story in the collection) is the best in the book and I was moved as well by \\"The Rocket Man\\", a story about grief and loss beautiful in its simplicity. Also, the device of the Illustrated Man still works on a second read and is a stroke of inspiration.Some of the stories are not good literature from a writing or character development perspective, but are extremely clever and fun -- neat ideas that would make (or have made) great Twilight Zone stories. My favorite is the time traveler story.One story (No Particular Night or Morning) is deeply philosophical in nature. The character portrayal is not convincing but the philocophical idea of space travelers who are compelled to question their own existence is about as good and interesting an exposition of a philsophical issue as you'll ever find.Many stories are clunkers, I'm afraid -- the situations are usually interesting but the characters are wooden and not believable.Also fascinating is how science ficition ages with time. The vision of the future tells us more about the past than anything else. No one seems to have foreseen cell phones, the internet, and the communications/information revolution (although Arthur C. Clarke in Childhood's End comes close). You can harldy fault Bradbury for this, but it's interesting how the futurists simply extrapolate their current world into the future -- i.e., brute machines are the rage in 1950, so they imagine even better, more brutish machines in the future.For all his limitations as a writer, Bradbury has written some classic stories that I would include in a literary anthology for this period. I therefore recommend that you read or re-read this book."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I think it was first my 8th grade teacher Mrs. Forenza who introducted me to Ray Bradbury when we studied the story \\"The Veldt\\"... then it was my father who opened his bookshelves and gave me his entire collection of Ray Bradbury when I asked him if he ever heard of him.The Illustrated Man is my favorite out of all of Ray Bradbury's books. I still cannot believe that this novel was written during the 1950's. He is quite prophetic in the stories... and my favorite one that I now committed to memory...The VeldtThank you dad, thank you Mrs. Forenza..."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury was a very unique novel. It is not like any other book. The short stories can relate to our life because it talks about selfishness, greed, and racism. I enjoyed reading this novel even though it was science fiction. This book contains a lot of imagery and scenery, which made this novel exciting. I liked this book because I read a lot of unexpected things, which made it more interesting.My favorite quote was from the chapter, \\" The Veldt.\\" \\"Children are carpets, they should be stepped on occasionally.\\" This quote is true because parents who let their children get their own way, may become spoiled. If parents let their children take advantage of them, it will become a habit and they can get out of control. Children should be taught at a young age and should be raised properly.I think this book should be required reading because there were many themes in the novel we all can learn from. Ray Bradbury's novel is filled with his imagination, which can take you on an adventure."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Illustrated Man. I especially liked reading The Veldt.The way Ray Bradbury described the nursery was amazing.I could imagine myself in it, with the vulture's shadow on the floor while it flies above.I think that he should write another story like it.I also liked reading The Other Foot.It was interesting to read what a colored person would do if the shoe was on the other foot. I think it makes people see that there really isn't a difference in people of different races and colors.It also shows that when you hold a grudge, it hurts yourself more then it hurts anyone else.I agree with Gandhi when he said \\"An eye only ends up making the whole world blind\\" Its true, because in they end, getting back at someone doesn't help you be a better person."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Ray Bradbury's book The Illustrated Man, was an intriguing and suspenseful book.

It also gives you an explanation why The Illustrated Man's is called the Illustrated Man."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and I must say The Illustrated Man is one of the greatest books I have truly ever read. It is about an odd man, with tattoos all over his body, but there's a catch; each tattoo pertains to a tale forecasting the future. Ray Bradbury's creativity, imagination, and unique style of writing took me to a whole new realm. The suspense in this book leaves you hanging in thin air, pondering and allowing yourself to use your own imagination. Each story has its share of excitement, morals, and ethics portraying human nature & society. Though a science fiction, this book gives a new sense of realism. Bradbury's stories teach us that anything is possible to happen in the future, but we as human beings have greater control over it. This fascinating novel shows how we can bring destruction and death to the brighter side of life.Some stories were better than others, but that's in my perspective. One of my favorite stories would have to be \\"Kaleidoscope.\\" It makes you wonder, when you're faced with death eye to eye, what will you think of the life you lived then?I highly recommend this book, especially for school. In comparison to other books we are assigned to read, this one is very different and can spark your interest very easily; it deals with the complexity of the human mind. This book will surely captivate you as it did to me."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This beautifully written science fiction book, written by Ray Bradbury, holds within it's mysterious covers, eighteen short stories. Each one that will capture and captivate it's reader. Fantasies that touches upon a person's wildest dreams, each story that sensually appeals to the senses. Not every one of them ends in a happy ever after, which makes it feel so much more real than even the best written fantasy books.Now personally, I dislike this book. No, I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE it. Such negativity! Such antagonistic thinking! At times while reading this, I had to put the book down while wearing a face of disgust. A favorite quotation? None. I was too involved with glaring at it to pick one out. The ONLY story that actually pleased me was \\"The Other Foot\\". It was one of the few stories that really spoke out to me. I rather read novels than the short stories that end on a bad note. It's as if the story is building up to a climax then suddenly stops only to skip on to another story to simply annoy me. I prefer books that give off a feel of optimism and cheerfulness with a good ending rather than finishing off so quickly as if it impatient to go on to another story.The Illustrated Man should not be required reading. Half the time, it talks about the impending doom of Earth. Great...we all know that the end of Earth is inevitable but MUST the author continue poking and prodding the gruesome idea of it? He even comes up with ways of how the Earth will end. There is the nuclear war, a WWIII, an atom war...OH LOOKY! There's even one where Earth just \`ends' for no reason at all. I prefer to read things that makes me laugh until I am out of breath and leaves me a happy feeling. Perhaps I'm being a bit cynical of it but this is how I feel about this book. Yet I am not trying to discourage people to read this lovely book. A large part of it revolves around celestial bodies and outer space. Feel free to read if you're a person who prefers short stories and scientific stories that deals with space, martians, and space, this book was probably made just for you."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If you are not a die-hard Bradbury fan do not waste your time with this book. It is pretty much a campy (ie. rockets, space, mars, etc.) collection of space stories. There are a few stories here with interesting views and/or concepts, but for the most part it's a poorly written, redundant, and slow paced book.If you are going to read Bradbury for the first time or are new to his writing I would recommend \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man was not a interesting book to read. It never appealed to me. Maybe I am biased because I never liked science-fiction, but not only that, this book was the pinnacle of confusion.

My favorite quote of this book is, \\"More than food or a woman or amything, I just want Earth.\\" This quote shows that people need Earth. Living on Earth is blessing and people don't know that.Despite me not liking the book, this book should be read. You learn many things from the book. It had many points and can be used to teach many things in life. Although this book had good points, it did not have thing that captivates you to read a book. It took be a month to read this because the book was not interesting."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is good for those in the psychological part of the work force. It is good for everyone else too, since it has several stories with in it, on top of a main one."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If you have dreams of going beyond in outer space, and if you are a big historian, this is the book for you. I gave this book three stars because it wasn't the best book I have ever read but it wasn't the worst. This book has eighteen small science fiction stories. This book was very confusing but fascinating. If you are not able to understand the stories in the beginning chances are you will eventually understand them in the end. This book is framed by the tale of a man who made fun of a witch from the future. The witch put eighteen illustrations on him, and if you stand next to the illustrated man your life is like a open book."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustraded was a good book, and reminded me of Farenheit 451. Which was also a good book that Ray Bradbury wrote. The book is mostly about space, time-travel and robots. It was exciting and also boring at times. Overall I think he could have made some of the stories a bit more excitng."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"&quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; consists of some of Ray Bradbury's many short-science-fiction-stories. While the first couple of stories may interest you, you will later find yourself bored by repeated subjects, settings, and characters.Ray Bradbury tends to write excessively about space, so if you are a space fanatic, this is the book for you. Otherwise, you will soon realize Bradbury's style, and constantly you will find yourself knowing what will happen on the next page.Bradbury's imagination and vivid descriptions are at times interesting, however. At times his writing style can get to be irritating. True potential, but not a thoughtfully put-together collection of Bradbury's works."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book, personally, I think, is very interesting, to say the least. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Sci-fi because thats basically what it is. Every chapter contains a new story, so it reads more like a collection of short stories that have nothing to do with each other, when if fact they all do, because they are all on the Illustrated man.Though I found some stories to be a bit confusing, and slightly frustrating, (since some I still didn't understand when finished.)All in all though the book was very catching, i.e. I couldn't put it down because the plot lines were very original and you never knew what to expect."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I know this is brief, but I just wanted to send out a quick survey on what people thought there favorite story was. Personally, mine was The Veldt. It's one of the stories that is truly scary, not just in shock value, but in how it stays with you. Especially when you see how much more advanced all the different video game consoles are getting. If you have friends, neighbors,brothers, sister, sons, daughters, or all of the above who enjoy nothing more than to sit down for hours inside the world of the game; than you are sure to find a good scare in The Veldt.P.S. I only gave this one start to attract the attention of other people like me who enjoy reading all the one star reviews to their favorite books. :)"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I don't mean to offend Ray Bradbury, but I didn't understand half of this book. I mean, some of the stories are quite unique, but once I read on and on about the other stories, I got so confused and bored. I didn't like this book much."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is filled with fascinating stories and morals that we all can learn from. Ray Bradbury has put much thought into his stories' themes such as love, hate, anger, regret, and most of all, hope. I was caught inside the author's descriptions as i read endlessly through the book. Even though the multiple stories are short, every character has personally bonded with me.There are many quotes in the book which would move every reader personally. In my opinion, one quote stood out among the others. \\"Love will fly if held too lightly, love will die if held too tightly.\\" At first, the quote was hard to believe, but as I read on in the story, I believed more and more in what the author wished to tell the readers.As a person that has taken this book closely to heart, I highly suggest this book to be a required reading item in schools. The morals that are taught in this novel should be wide-spread across the globe and throughout time."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I believe this book is a really great book because not only did i find the stories interesting, but they taught me lessons as well. I could relate to some of the stories in this book and reading this gave me a chance to reflect upon myself. There were stories filled with mystery, suspense, adventure, hardship, romance, and thrills. There were also heart warming stories and stories that would make you think. When I began reading the book, I thought it would be boring and dull just like some other books I read and would fall asleep reading it. The more stories I read, the more interested I became and was drawn to the book. I didn't want to put it down and that is why I finished the book in only one day.My favorite quote in the story was \\"There were differences between memories and dreams.He had only dreams of what he wanted to do, while Lespere had memories of things done and accomplished. And this knowledge began to pull Hollis apart, with a slow quivering precision.\\" This was my favorite quote because it tells you that you should live life to the fullest so that in the end you can die happy knowing what you have accomplished than die dreaming like you have been doing for all the years you lived, unsatisfied with your life.The Illustrated Man is a book that I would highly recommend everyone to read. This book consists of many stories each with its own theme and own moral. Though the whole book revolves around fantasy and science fiction, the overall meaning of each story can strongly relate to what we had to go through in the pass, what we're going through now, and what we may go through in the future. For example, the story Kaleidoscope showed us that the decisions you made in the past can greatly affect the way you think and act towards others, and that in the end all you will have are either dreams of what you wished you did or memories of what you actually accomplished doing. The story The Long Rain showed us that you have to stay strong during tough situations and never give up in order to reach what you truly desire. This is why I believe this book is a great book to read and is why I would recommend it to other people young and old."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is one of the most intriging and wonderful books I have ever read. It reveals the many different aspects of humans, both good and bad. The book is pure imagination, but at the same time, there is much reality in the book. Although some stories are dark and pessimistic, one dominant theme throughout the book is human understanding. All of the stories were spectacular, but in my opinion \\"The Kaleidoscope\\" was the greatest story of all of them. Floating in space with nothing but your crew's voices, waiting for your death to come is an awesome background.This book should be a required reading. It has so much material that could be used during discussions and many themes to choose for essay topics."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I really liked The Illustrated Man. I thought it was a really interesting book full of surprises and suspense. I really liked how the author used irony in the chapters. Although I did enjoy reading the book, I felt that the author used many feelings of sadness or depression. For example, most of the stories ended with the characters dying or not having a happy ending. My favorite quotation from the book came from the chapter Marionettes Inc.. It was a quote that Smith stated from an old poem; \\"Love will fly if held too tightly, love will die if held too tightly.\\" I really liked that quote because when I thought about it and how it related to the story, I realized how true it was.I think that this book should be required reading for incoming Sophomores. This book is very unique and teaches some really good life lessons. It also keeps you interested and want to keep reading to find out what happens next. I really enjoyed this book because when it was getting towards the end of each chapter, I would think that I had the ending all figured out, but then the author surprises me with a totally different ending than what I expected. I especially liked that at the end of the book when the author talked about the Illustrated Man choking the other man to death. It was a very interesting book that should be required."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If you are into suspense and you are looking for a good thrill that will keep you reading, you should read, \\"The Illustrated Man\\". This novel consists of 18 amazing stories that capture your attention and keep you wondering what will happen next. It is a science fiction novel that I thought would be boring but came out to be really interesting. There were many stories that really captured my attention because I can relate my life to it.As for a favorite quote I did not necessarily have one. But I did have 5 favorite stories, although all 18 were wonderful. I particularly liked the following 5 stories, \\"The Rocket Man\\", \\"The Rocket\\", \\"The Veldt\\", \\"The Fox and The Forest\\", and \\"Marionettes Inc.\\"This book is interesting and really captured my attention. I recommend everyone to read it. When I was first told i would have to do a project over summer i figured it would be some boring book.

I rated this book with four stars because of my personal opinions. I think this book is great to be required reading because you get to learn more about the short story structures and the styles that the author used. For example, using multiple points of view and changing narrators to give impact on the whole story. The way that the author described his ideas through the illustrations or tattoo in this book was great and fascinating. To me, it was fun to read all different kinds of short stories which mainly focuses on similar topic and that you get to learn great lessons, which relates to your life.But there were some parts that I really disliked about. Because the book was written in short stories, it was difficult to find the turning points or the actual conflict of the book, but it was still noticeable about the main idea of the book, which the author wanted the readers to find out. The book has a lot of unique stories that teaches you a lot of lessons.This book is great and I recommend this book to be required reading."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury was a pretty good book.

This book has good suspense, intresting deaths, and human instinct put to the test in a complete futuristic setting. A setting so well put together we can see ourselves among the charactars. There's no doubt about it, The Illustrated Man is one of the best best books I've ever read.I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and I think it was a great book to end the summer with. It is perfect school material for teens everywere. And the best part, it's only 186 pages long. People who can't deal with 500 page stories, this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I had to read this book as a summer assignment in my upcoming English II Honors class. The book started when a man meets The Illustrated Man and they have a talk about the illustrations on his body. The man begins to watch as the illustrations come to life and 18 stories come to pass as well as the mans own future.I found this book interesting but way too morbid. About 90% of the people in this book died horrible deaths. I was inclined to one particular story in \\"The Illustrated Man\\" called The Exiles, where my favorite quote \\"I find our situation amusing.\\" by Mr. Bierce is found. Other than that I found it to be not of my particular taste. The basis of the book where almost every story had to deal somewhat with space was good. I would probably recommend this to people who find space travel very interesting or who are very interested in science fiction.I don't believe that this book should be assigned to students to read because it's just a little bit too morbid and alot of people don't want to read about constant death."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This Book has a really interesting and unique style to it telling 18 fascinating stories through the art work painted upon a man. The stories told deal with many things generally regarding science fiction. Many of his stories are very strange and memorable but they tend to lean toward a grim side. More then a few of his stories tend to be a little depressing.Overall I have to say that Ray Bradbury did a great job bringing the stories to life and expressing each of the characters vividly to my mind. Also his vivid description of many of the settings could make imagine myself there and doing the things he described. Each one of his stories told of characters experiences and he told them in his own way. The stories pretained to many things many of which included Sci-Fi aspects. The stories dealt with many different things from the last minutes of a rockets crews life, the attempt of some clergymen to bring god to people who always had him or a destroyed civilizations final revenge upon it's destroyers.There are a few stories I felt did not live up to his others but since his writing is so broad many people are likely to have enjoyed the few I didn't. Even though this is a fact it did little to lessen the overall experience this book presents to it's readers.My Assessment is that this book is a good title to be required reading because it gives the reader a unique form of literature to experience and broaden their horizons. I say that this book is a great book especially for you Sci-Fi fans this is a great pick. The reason I only gave this a four was because although the book was great I can't help but compare it to other books particularly science fiction and I gave it a score accordingly. The score may not be a five but I would suggest to people who want to read an interesting book to pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man, written by Ray Bradbury, is an extraordinary book that teaches many lessons and morals of life. In my opinion of this novel, I give more praise than criticism. I loved how the author ends each story with a sense of compassion for one of the characters or a sense of mystery, wondering what had happened next to that character. The stories I liked in particular are \\"The Rocket Man\\" and \\"Marionettes INC.\\"I chose \\"The Rocket Man\\" because of its sense of compassion for two of the main characters, its description of the outer depths of space and how the conclusion makes the reader reflect this story to your life. My favorite quote from this short story is when the rocket man's son asks him what's it like in space and the rocket man replies, \\"It's the best thing in a lifetime of best things.\\" This story teaches me that there is no place like home. Sure you may want to run away from it all, but in the end you will find yourself wanting to retrace your steps to place that you once had called home.As for \\"Marionettes INC,\\" I loved how the author creates the conclusion of suspicion between the each of the spouses and leaves you guessing what had happened to each of the characters. This story teaches me that robots or marionettes eventually evolve. (I learned that through watching the movie I, Robot.) Because these forms of technology will eventually evolve, humans must be careful of technology destroying the human race.I personally would recommend this book for other readers to read this book whether or not you are interested in scientific fiction because no matter what, this book teaches us all lessons of life that cannot be taken for granted.- Noelle EvangelistaGahr High School English Honors"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"PERSONALY i liked the book. The things that cought my interest was the storys iside of another story. Just fromthe storysi read Bradbury has a unique originality to hisstorys and that uniqueness is rare too come across.In this particular book Bradbury was genous when he wrote this book. aech story had a moral to to it. Some of the morals where life lessons. How he contructed each scene and setting wereamazing.reading The Illustrated Man is greate way to vocabulayand imagination. One of the quates that I liked the best was Sual walked along the shore of the dead sea. In other words it means Sual walked along a field of dead or dying bodies.I would recomend this to others because of the format or waythe book was written."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Illustrated Man. I especially liked reading The Veld. The way Ray Bradbury described the nursery was amazing. I could imagine myself in it, with the vulture's shadow on the floor while it flies above. I think that he should write another story like it. I also liked reading The Other Foot. It was interesting to read what a colored person would do if the shoe was on the other foot. I think it makes people see that there really isn't a difference in people of different races and colors. It also shows that when you hold a grudge, it hurts yourself more thn it hurts anyone else. I agree with Gandhi when he said \\"An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind\\" Its true, because in the end, getting back at someone doesn't help you be a better person."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I gave the book 3 stars because I didn't really like hte book. It really didn't grab my interest. I also got lost a couple of times. I didn't know how to coprehend some of the thing that the novel was saying. The reason i didn't give the book 1 or 2 stars because i did like two chapter of the book. The veldt and the other foot I thought that the veldt was cool because the house did everything for the children and i thought that was cool. I also thought that the other foot was cool too because I liked how the blacks let the whites live with them on mars."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated man had a lot of great stories that people would like, if they are intrested in stories that are helpful to people. My favirote story is the Long Rain it showed a lot about following your dreams as they follow you.

I would recommend this book to all the agges 11 and up."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I like the story because it was very interesting and i like how they made the nursery look like they was in Africa. What I also like about this book is the way Ray Bradley put his imagination together and make a very funny and crazy book about these people life and how hard it was to live on mars and New York etc..What i dislike about the veldt is that the kids killed their parents because their parents felt that they was paying more attention to the technology and they respect it more then their parents so that is why they took it away but other then that the book was real fun to read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The story, Illustrated man was a very interesting book. Telling many tories in one story. Thamt makes the book very unique. I suggest taht everyone reads this book. This book inspired me to read more fiction books. Since I never read to read these kinds of books. This book is also good for all ages.The book will be good for you fiction book lovers out there. He writes so much two word descriptions. Which enables you to picture the story as if you were there. It makes me feel like im making my own movie and my mind while I read this novel. Bradbury is now of of my all time favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated man is a book containing eighteen stories, which will completely change the way that you perceive things. This book is unlike any other book I have ever read. It combines problems that we face today and problems that we may face in the future. The book showed me that more people are losing faith in god everyday and are starting to lie, cheat, and steal more often. All eighteen stories contained vivid descriptions, which made the stories very easy to visualize.Each story had its own unique perspective to how everything works, and left you asking questions like how do you know that something exists when you can't see it. Even though you know that it does, there is still no proof that you can keep with you.The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, was a spectacular book, especially for those interested in science fiction novels. This book truly was the greatest science fiction novel that I have ever read. I think this book should be recommended reading, not just because this book is truly awe-inspiring but also because it can help people all around the world think in new ways."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I've read Illustrated Man for sophomore Honor summer project. I've taken too much time finished this book. As for me it was not that interesting book because I thought it has more logical and imagination involves. And I realize myself that I didn't get used to imagine and free mind. This book made me tough to understand fully. I mean some portion of story is totally touchable, but other few parts are just screw me to concentrated and understand as well. Actually before I've enjoyed this book deals with rocket is not my line. Because I didn't really care about the happen occur way far from earth. But on my second thought, rocket ship and space are totally cool and attractive even though everything consists of imagination.Mainly, there's really engrossing chapter from the book which is \\"The Rocket Man\\". I select it for best touchable and agreeable part, because it describes dedicate love of family. Also it tells readers that how family worth to their life is. Each single person in family means infinite much. The thing they spent time together and sharing their precious thought randomly depend weather their life is happy or lonesome. I've remembered the last page of this book says that \\"And, for along while, the only days we ever went out to walk we're the days when it was raining and there was no sun.\\"(Ray 111). Every peaces of words they talk totally sorrow and all the action they express how much the family deeply love dad therefore they choose not to go outside when the sun is shining. The reason they dislike to contact with sun is dad passed away from the sun and it reminds them for dad.Lastly I decide to recommend this book should be requiring read from my point. Because I think it is such a special and critical book. Even I had hard time to understand this book for somewhat, however it's worth while to read. For example the reader should get emotional feeling because they never seen engrossing happen from real life. There's different people have variety opinion of this book. But they've experienced how can they bring up their imagination and variation."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Overall The Illustrated Man was an interesting book. It kept me in with fantastic details of the setting. Such as in the story called \\"The Veldt\\" where Bradbury described the smells and colors of the environment. Also when i came to the end of a story i ended up thinking about it for long periods of time even after im done reading for the day. For example like in the story called \\"The Rocket Man\\". This story made me think, is space so amazing that a man would be somewhat addicted to it and basically leave his family behind for it.Actually i do have a favorite quote. Its from the story called \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and it goes \\"Did all dying people feel this way, as if they had never lived?\\". It made realize what it would be like to drift in space all alone in space knowing that your going to die and only to be thinking about how complete your life was.Well the book was good for summer reading but i think it would be even better if it was read during the school year because some parts of the book was very confusing and seems like it would be better if a teacher was there for help.by Arnel R."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I thought this book was pretty good, since it was the first sci-fi book I actually read in my life.There were some chapters I liked because of the imagery that Ray Bradbury put into his book.For example I saw the parents getting eaten by the lions in the veldt. I also saw the men getting sliced and diced by \\"The City\\". A very detailed scene was in \\"The fox and the forest\\", where Mr. Simms was ran over by Williams's car.My favorite quote came from the chapter \\"The fox and the forest\\", and it was \\" The rabbits may hide this forest, said a voice, but a fox can always find them\\". I like this qoute because the tone of the qoute being said give a mood that the person might be a serial killer. I would only require this book for reading in the summer, because it is not a book with a big plot to follow, which makes it easier for a kid to follow along. Something wierd went wrong with my book because I found a couple mistakes, or at least I thought they were mistakes. But other than that I thought it was a great book to follow along since it had mini stories that tied into a big story."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, is an astonishing novel that retains many meaningful messages. The novel is divided by eighteen short stories that each has totally different characters, conflicts, and solutions. I really enjoyed the way Bradbury creates each ending of the story with an ironic and unexpected idea. The stories are apparently different but throughout the reading, I discovered that these stories have one thing in common; it is a mystery. The most of the stories have a topic related to mystery, and I like most of them because they have mysterious flows and reasonable answers.Among these amazing stories, I love \\"The Other Foot\\" and \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" In \\"The Other Foot,\\" Willie Johnson once said, \\"The time for being fools is over. We got to be something else except fools.\\" This quote teaches me that there is no better thing as a help to people who are desperate with our help. Helping others could be tiresome and annoying at first however that little help can be a big effect to people in desperate.Although there are some stories that I don't agree, like \\"The Long Rain\\" and \\"The Exiles,\\" The Illustrated Man should be required reading because after reading people will have an opportunity to come up with their new ideas based on their point of view. The science fiction could be a difficult reading, but I believe that most of people will agree with the novel.Lydia (So Young) ChoiGahr High School"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, is a collection of eighteen short stories that are coalesced into a single, brilliant novel, which I deem as a classical thriller. The novel begins when a man encounters a mysterious stranger, whom he later discovers is \\"Illustrated.\\" Woven onto the stranger's body are arcane designs that create magical stories which foretell the future. Although many of the stories are not affiliated in any way, they all brandish an underlying innuendo of an upcoming nuclear holocaust or some sort of world destruction.Although I did not take pleasure in some of the stories in the novel because of its visionary fallacies of an Armageddon, I believe The Illustrated Man was one of the best, thought-provoking books that I have read, so far. \\"There's a Truth in [everything]. All parts of the Big Truth. On a certain day they'll all fit together like pieces of a jigsaw.\\" As you can see, this novel by Ray Bradbury also conveys a sure regard to faith and all of its glory in the stories of \\"The Man\\" and \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" leading us to believe that although the future brings anguish and devastation, there is a route to salvation.Even though this novel was extremely awe-inspiring in my opinion, I think that The Illustrated Man should not be a required reading. Many students would not benefit from reading a novel that possesses such a sinister outlook on the future of the world. It may even corrupt a naive child's mind, spreading the cancer of infectious thoughts about world destruction and constant suspicion. However, I still regard Ray Bradbury as an eccentric, yet dignified genius who is genuinely unsurpassed in his title of the \\"greatest science fiction writer\\" and The Illustrated Man as a timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This is the sort of direction I like to see the genre going, relatively simple story line exploring the the inner workings of humans in a futuristic setting. The events that occur in Bradbury's stories, although fiction, seem more real because such things could happen in a future where technology has advanced so much.I generally enjoyed all of 18 of the short stories. All of them unique and slightly morbid. Personally, I love stories with a bit of morbidness and depression, it gives it more of a gritty realism of how life really is. I found that \\"Marionettes Inc.\\" was my favorite story. This is the kind of story I like, where humans start becoming dependent on human-like cyborgs or \\"dolls\\" because they are convenient, obedient, and life-like. Then everything seems to fall apart as the AI wants to be human itself or it has become too human for it to be of any help to the owner.My favorite quote from one of the stories, \\"Fire Balloons,\\" is \\"Can't you recognize the human in the inhuman?\\" and then \\"I'd much rahter recognize the inhuman in the human.\\" Personally, I believe it sums up what the novel is all about. The Illustrated Man deals with human relations with one another, technology, and other forms of being; how they can help one another, but most of the time destroy.I most highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of science fiction and even if you are not. Its extraordinarily well written and provides compelling short stories making you wish there was more then just a few pages. I wouldn't say it was depressing, but some may find it not too their liking because of the untimely end of most of the characters. Nonetheless, it is highly recommendable and broadens horizons because that's what true science fiction does. I am most definitely checking out Ray Bradbury's other works and The Illustrated Man movie!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is probably the greatest book I've ever read! It's a woderful blend of reality of then and of the future yet to come. It starts out with a man that meets the illustrated man and is told the story of how the illustations came to be. The illustrated man is litteraly illustrated with tatoos,and at night the tatoos would move, speak and play out stories of the future.Then the man stays and watches the stories come together and alive. The stories are so incredible i could hardly put the book down.This book made me think of things in a whole different way. Seeing how people then thought of things then that are nothing now or what he believes will and still can happen is a real eye-opener. I would most deffinetly reccomend this book to anyone thats looking for a good story."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Perfect to read right before sleep. Or at an Airport, waiting for your flight. I picked up this edition up at my schools store. It was two weeks later that I finally had the opportunity to read into the prologue. I didn't have much time, but found the reading easy, and loveable. I quickly devored the first short story. That of a holodeck dream room, which aloof children close themselves away in secret from their parents. I must tell you of my day afterwards. I was in class, during an important lecture. I must confess that the story played around in my mind, the descriptions had brought on images;clear and meaningful. After finishing my laborous day, I quickly fell into the pocket sized book, found my dog-eared page and read another short story. And another. Every story left me fascinated, In fact, I finished the book before the night. I remember looking online for all of Ray Bradbury's works. I had fallen in deep interests with the man. He had, in a short interval of roughly twenty pages apeice, puzzled together a fabulous, demensional exhistance of fiction that I had enjoyed, and would continue to enjoy. I've read this book over and over again. I've read it in semenar, I've recommended it to everyone I know. I hope you find this book.-jeff"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This group of highly imaginative tales, written in 1948-51, do nothing if not illustrate that 1) it's extremely difficult to predict the future and 2) no matter how much we struggle against it, we probably are doomed to reflect our own times and cultural environment. Over half a century after Ray Bradbury wrote these entertaining stories, we have a lot of answers to questions about the (then) future thanks to hindsight. Bradbury's characters still smoke like chimneys, they still use clunky mid-20th century machines for the most part---lugging electrical equipment and card tables across the light years in their bronze spaceships. There's only the vaguest hint of a computer (\\"The City\\") and then of the giant, controlling variety. Above all, there is no vision of the infinitely varied America of today---the space explorers in these stories are nearly all white Anglosaxons who speak and behave as white people did in the early 1950s. The cultural oppositions and arguments in the stories are those of mid-century America. While it is true that Bradbury writes of human nature it is also true that the nature he describes is as we saw it half a century ago.However, Bradbury covers a wide range of topics: child psychology; machine vs. man; imagination and emotion vs. cold science; religion; time travel, and race relations. Some of the stories are unbelievably poignant. In fact, I would say that poignancy---the ability to bring out that quality without being sappy or twee---is Bradbury's strongest suit. If you don't like science fiction, this book probably isn't for you, but it certainly has made its mark on American culture, with 47 printings through 1990. One story, \\"The Exiles\\", probably laid the basis for his later \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". Bradbury wrote many stories which featured the \\"wrap-around-comfort, totally mechanized houses\\" that appear in several works in this volume. How many Hollywood movies of the last 15 years owe a debt to \\"The Fox and the Forest\\", a story of people escaping through time from a bad future to a quieter or more prosperous present ? THE ILLUSTRATED MAN is a minor American classic in a perennially shortchanged genre, science fiction. The dated technology and cultural styles may seem primitive today, but even they add a dimension of telling us about the times in which they were written as well as about the future as they saw it then."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I really really enjoyed this book, it is one of my favourites. The stories inside were very shocking and unique and thought provoking too. It is not your normal futuristic book about the future with its gadgets and high technology and robots that seem impossible, this is a creative but rather realistic book too. I especially enjoyed &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; as it was rather touching and sad and after reading that, I highlighted a phrase inside about some people having only dreams when they die and they die unhappily, while others have real memories, so they are able to die without regrets.All in all, I think this book is fantastic, a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Conceptually, The Illustrated Man is brilliant from the get-go, including its novel premise of 18 stories as told through the moving tattoos on a man's body; in addition to weaving intricate webs, the Illustrated Man's body art predicts the future.And, oh, what stories are told. As a science fiction writer, it is no surprise that the majority of Bradbury's stories have to do with space and the future (heck, all of space was in the future when these stories were written in the early 50s). Additionally, the majority of the tales are pretty bleak, dealing with dark themes of revenge, futile searches for paradise, and Armageddon. However, save for their near-universal excellence, thought-provocation, and prescience, the similarities end there.Among them: Mars is colonized by black people who have left Earth's prejudices, and await with apprehension the arrival of a white-piloted rocket ship from their former homeland; another planet's soldiers attack Earth and are surprised at the warm welcome they receive, only to learn that they can be conquered by Earth's lousy diet, sedentary ways, and shallow culture as easily as by the planet's military; an assembly of priests travels to Mars to learn about Martian sins, so as to spread God's word and earn converts of the Red plant; an entire city is built with the concept of vengeance in mind, by its citizens who were to perish before being able to exact that revenge themselves; the authors of classic tales of horror, whose works are banned on Earth, are themselves exiled to Mars and only kept alive by the few remaining copies not burned for censorship.There are a couple of lame ducks herein, but even those are salvaged by the beauty of Bradbury's writing. His metaphors and descriptive devices flow from the pages and grant a macabre beauty to even the most desolate of landscapes."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Sometimes it's hard to remember that Ray Bradbury approaches the art of the short story in a very unconventional way. His collections of short stories are often tied together by common sub-themes or settings, although each story could also stand on its own. Such is the case here, though the running theme to the Illustrated Man collection is mostly an abstraction. Apparently the stories here are told by a man's haunted tattoos, but don't worry about that too much. The true theme holding this group of stories together is examinations of human nature and mankind's place in the universe. Bradbury's frequent use of Mars (and occasionally other planets) as a setting, with the obligatory spaceships and technology, is merely his method of creating alternate realities to bring human nature into bold relief.Bradbury's classic examinations of the dark and melancholy side of humanity are well represented here as always, with his trademark poetic writing style and underlying sense of creeping dread. The classic virtual reality tale &quot;The Veldt&quot; is found here, with the typical misuse-of-technology theme presented in an unexpectedly haunting fashion. More evidence that the stock sci-fi themes are merely a thin backdrop can be seen in &quot;The Other Foot,&quot; a chilling examination of race relations; or &quot;The Rocket,&quot; which deals with the yearning of regular people to reach beyond the confines of Earth. Other winning stories include &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;The Long Rain&quot; which are haunting tales of how human nature can still undermine the greatest achievements of cold technology. So don't concern yourself with the typical sci-fi backdrop, and get in tune with what Ray Bradbury is really talking about."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This is one of those &quot;must own&quot; books that you always hear about, in a hundred years this and a handful of other Bradbury books will be considering classics of American literature. Basically a collection of about a guy who has all this illustrations on his body that shows the stories to an unnamed observer. Personally I have no idea why he bothered with the Illustrated Man concept, the stories stand on their own just fine, though it does give him the opportunity to give a great sucker punch ending. And the concept is basically ignored after the second story but hey when the stuff is this good who am I to complain? The stories themselves, like I said are all excellent, some more than others but it's mostly the distinction between &quot;real good&quot; and &quot;really really really good&quot;. The highlights are the opening &quot;The Veldt&quot; which is classic Bradbury and some story about some guys on Venus who are going crazy from getting rained on and a few others. Most of his stories are science-fictional, often revolving in one way or another around rockets but Bradbury deals less with actual science and more about fantasy and dreams, leading to some real good touching moments, above all his stories are about people, they just happened to be set in the future on Mars. Some are sentimental, some are creepy, some are funny but all are good. And it's quick reading, so you have no excuse.

And when the moon is risen and the tales are told, the dark marks may tell the most horrifying story of all.Bradbury isn't for everyone, and several of his stories aren't for the squeamish. This collection of short stories is mostly tame, and as uneven in quality as most short-story collections. \\"The Veldt\\" and \\"Zero Hour\\" are brilliantly-stirred blends of sci-fi and gothic horror, while \\"The Man\\" and \\"The Fire Balloons\\" are dull and meandering improvisations on religious themes. Among Bradbury's most intriguing stories are the psychological dramas of \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World,\\" balanced by the tedious moralizing of \\"The Other Foot\\" (a story which probably had much greater punch in the years before desegregation).\\"The Illustrated Man\\" is a product of its time, and is streaked through with the dialogue, assumptions, fears, and expectations of the mid-20th century. Some of the themes Bradbury explores still resonate, but he never rises to the timeless transcendence of a Dickens, a Hugo, or an Austen. However, as one of the most popular and devilishly clever American novelists of the 20th century, his short stories here collected deserve a look. But don't look too closely...the picture may begin to move, and you may see yourself..."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I have read The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury many times. I will continue to read this wonderful little book. Like most of Bradbury's work, one can never get bored reading his stories. His stories are at times terrible, dark and they are beautiful, fascinating and in many ways a portal to the future. They are also a wonderful escape from the now.The Illustrated Man is more a short story collection woven together by a central theme. The theme is The Illustrated Man. I agree with many other persons that it is important to realize he is illustrated, not tattooed. And how did he get the illustrations? A witch did the illustrations. He has been on the road searching for her ever since she put them on every inch of his flesh. When he finds her, he plans to kill her. Why? The illustrations are magical and move on his body. They are magic. If you look at theme for a period, they will tell you a story.The Illustrated Man moves through 18 stories. \\"The Veldt\\" is my favorite story. \\"The Veldt\\" is one of the best short stories ever written. I also enjoyed \\"The Long Rain\\" (about rain of Venus) and \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" (about an artificial intelligence body double being used where a man can go out on the town, but the double ultimately taking the man's place and wife). There are so many great stories ranging from Sci-Fi to mild horror. It is a great book I would recommend for all middle school age and older.Read and Reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"While the cover of the paperback that I read states that Bradbury is \\"The World's Greatest Living Science Fiction Writer\\", I respectfully disagree. Science fiction is so broad a field that there is significant overlap with horror and fantasy. I would without question call Bradbury the best author ever in the field of horrific science fiction. For, while his stories are generally based on a scientific theme, the real power is in the horrific aspects of the events.When I was young, my favorite short story was \\"The Veldt\\", the first one in this collection of Bradbury's best short stories. A modern house contains what we would now call a holodeck, and instead of the children conjuring up delightful images, they are interested only in a scene of the African veldt, where lions pursue and devour their prey. Complete with the smell, sound and heat of the plains, the parents of the children are concerned that it is unhealthy. The parents try to do something to stop it, but they end up being consumed by the lions conjured up by the room.Most of the other stories deal with the same theme, technology gone wrong. Atomic and biological warfare appears in many of the stories. However, the best part of all the stories is the tension and the unusual endings, often based on the frailties of human psychology. The intertwining of science fiction and horror makes these stories unique and I see a lot of similarities between Bradbury and Stephen King. In this area, he is better than King."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I highly recommend this book to any fan of Ray Bradbury's work, or to anyone who wishes to introduce his classic works into their library. He is a passionate visionary that writes not only about sci-fi, but his colorful writing style encapsulates the sometimes ineffable feelings that each and every one of us have had about every possible situation in life, and dare I say, in death. I always feel like a kid again when I read his books, I am taken away to warm, sunny Saturdays when I was still in awe of the newness of life. I can hardly force myself to read the works of others as I am convinced that no one can do with words the magic that Ray Bradbury has done."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Some people I know have had real trouble 'getting' Bradbury's work. The bulk of his best work was written in the 50's and 60's. Some concepts in this book are simply outdated. However, in every story is study of a concept that never has and never will be out-dated, The Human Condition. 'The Man', 'Kaliedascope' and 'The Long Rain' are my personal favorites. Potential readers must also understand that Bradbury is not a science fiction writer. A lot of his stories have science fiction themes and backgrounds, but Fantasy is a better way to describe his work. From hard core fantasy, such as what you will find in this book, to subtle fantasy, such as 'Dandelion Wine' you will find the most important element of Bradbury's work is EMOTION. This man is a true one of a kind Artist. I also recommend: Something Wicked this Way Comes, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, Fahrenheit 451 and any of his other earlier short story collections. Bradbury truly is a GrandMaster. PS- You Kids should keep your opinions to your self. You are only making yourselves look bad."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is simply amazing! I needed to read this book as a summer reading project, and as soon as I read the first story, I found out that the book was based on Science Fiction. It's a topic that I really hate it! However, as I read further and further into the book, I decided that I loved it! Each story bases itself around science, like people living on the moon or on Mars. Also, there are some controversial goings-on in this novel. In one short story titled \\"The Man\\", it seems as though a traveler would stop by towns and heal people. The man in this story almost sounds as though he is Jesus. Anyway, this book is still amazing. If you love Sci Fi, then buy it now!!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I usually do not enjoy fiction stories, mostly because fiction authors I did not enjoy were tossed down my throat every day of my undergrad, with professors shouting \\"THIS IS GOOD WRITING!!!\\". However, when a professor suggested I read this book, I really enjoyed it, and remember reading a few selections during high school. This is a collection of science fiction short stories, connected through this idea of an illustrated man. Again, the only reason I did not give this five stars, is because fiction/science fiction isn't my favorite."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Ray Bradbury's unforgettable and incomparable masterpiece of short stories brimming with fantasy and futuristic imaginations.

So I chose 'The Illustrated Man' and Bradbury StoriesBradbury Stories: 100 of His Most Celebrated Tales. In the new introduction of this 1951 classic he discusses his conversation with a waiter in Paris at the Champs du Mars near the Eiffel Tower. The young waiter explains his busy lifestyle and his love of dancing, he says, \\"To be asleep is to be dead. It is life death, so we dance as not to be dead...\\" The waiter goes on to ask what Ray Bradbury did and Bradbury says, \\"I write... so as not to be dead, like you.\\"And Bradbury wrote until the day he died.His name will always be synonymous with prolific.The Illustrated Man is not perfect. It is dated. However, taken in context, it was unique, imaginative and ahead of it's time.Till this day, when I see a tattooed individual, which is quite common, I wonder to myself: what would their tattoos say? What stories would they tell if they were to become animated on their skin, like Bradbury's character.My fond memories transcend his written word, years ago when I worked at Borders, Ray Bradbury was always a great supporter of Libraries, book stores and literary events and festivals... if you lived in LA, you could meet Ray Bradbury.Dance on Ray Bradbury,Dance in the minds and hearts or your readers."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"rip ray rip bradbury the best most talented writer we ever had he will be missed by many have a great journey into the unknown. see you on the otherside. \\"ozzy osbourne\\"."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"this is a wonderful set of stories. r.i.p. bradbury we will miss such a peaceful talented soul. r.i.p. ray bradbury june 5 2012"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"this is a wonderful book. the stories are great too. i do have one complaint though. there is not a plain text edition available on kindle. what a great author passed away last night r.i.p. june 5th 2012. may his soul see the world from a more peaceful and less dystopian existence. the otherside really is more beautiful. best regards psycho headhunter number one fan dandelion wine is another favorite"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Listening to this audio version of the book, I was reminded of how scary these stories are. Narrator Scott Brick's light touch makes the tales all the more devastating--from \\"The Veldt\\" to its chilling bookend \\"Zero Hour\\" (with it's horrific, tossed-off line, \\"Mom, I'll be sure you won't be hurt much, really!\\") These stories while nominally science fiction, can also be considered horror stories, especially when considered with the \\"Illustrated Man\\" framing device. (This audio edition comes with the full, final story of the Man which doesn't appear in earlier editions. It also has Bradbury's 1997 preface.) Anyway, these stories are very much likeThe October Country; I would only listen to these CD's with all the lights on."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is a glorious masterpiece. Ray Bradbury, in a particularly twisted bit of insight, set out to analyize what was then his background and culture of modern times, then tear it asunder with the withering majesty of the extraordinary. Is it any wonder that EC Comics in the 1950s greedily set out to gobble up anything Bradbury oriented?The Illustrated Man is what should be called 'a linked-story story collection/novel,' some complicated mish-mosh of related themes and on-going narratives, a sort of The Crypt Keeper, yet with deeper insight, setting up the tales. Many of the stories are just marvelous--\\"The Veldt,\\" \\"Kaleidscope,\\" \\"The Other Foot\\" for a study of an issue many people hold desperately tight to the chest. The majesterial masterpieces: \\"The Long Rain,\\" \\"The Last Night of the World.\\" \\"The Exiles,\\" \\"The Concrete Mixer,\\" \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" \\"Zero Hour,\\" \\"The Rocket.\\" Even \\"The Illustrated Man\\"--still, in essence, a gimmick with an appropriate, semi-chilling end--even this narrative has its terrifying moments.Ray Bradbury, in this as well as several other of his books, serves as a chilling prophet of the future and as a vicious but ultimately good-natured guy laughing at death and destruction and having a hell of a time.

Within this book are miniaturized stories showing either a lesson or a unique event that we could learn from. The author did well on explanining each conflict. He showed very imaginative struggles that would end in either a strange or calming manner.I think this material is required reading since it's complex stories create very imaginative yet vivid stories. It's decription of time, space, and the future feel so real. It's many themes relate to human experiences, which makes it easy to understand. I would reccomend this book to be either bought or borrowed."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"In \\"The Illustrated Man\\", Ray Bradbury collected 18 splendid tales of science fiction, fantasy and horror, whose literary quality demonstrated that he was as brilliant a prose stylist and storyteller as his celebrated predecessors Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft. Though some of these stories may seem a bit dated now, more than fifty years after they were written, their vivid imagination, and excellent prose are still quite spellbinding. One of his finest tales is the chilling \\"The Veldt\\" which opens this collection, putting a radical new twist on disputes between parents and their children. Another classic is \\"The Fire Balloons\\", which is a riveting tale of how some Christian clergymen find their faith renewed on the planet Mars. The most frightening tale is unquestionably, \\"The City\\", describing the fateful encounter by explorers from Earth who have stumbled upon a deserted, yet pristine-looking, city. In these tales Bradbury has exploited the themes and metaphors of science fiction and fantasy so that these have been universal, and frankly, quite accessible to a wider readership than those who are interested mainly in these genres. I regard Bradbury as among our finest short story writers in any genre writing in English; \\"The Illustrated Man\\" elegantly proves my point."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If science fiction intrests you, then The Illustrted Man, by Ray Bradbury is the perfect book for you. It tells stories of space, rockets, and futursitic concepts. It makes you think \\"what if\\" and uses very detailed desrciptions. I felt that this was an excellent book. Not only did all 18 stories intrest me, but I also learned many life lessons. There is something to learn or remember in each of the stories, no matter how random, or how short.I also feel that this should be a required book for the above reasons. This book is something that could help anyone that reads it. For instance, im not a science fiction person, at all. But to my surprise, I was able to learn a lot from this book. My favorite quote from the book would have to be \\"My word is my proof,\\" said the mayor. I love this quote because it talks about God and how the people in one town had faith and believed in him and were able to get healed, while another man stood there looking for physical proof and because he couldnt find any, wasn't able to believe that he was there."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If your into science ficton books, then The Illustrated Man is the perfect book for you. Ray Bradbury did an excellent job in creating visual scenes and bringing characters and creatures to life. I personally enjoyed this book through and through and it was an interesting ride from the beginning to end. This book actually surprised me. You know the saying, dont judge a book by it\`s cover? Well that is exactly what I did with this book. From the cover to the introduction, it did not seem to be the type of book that I would be interested in and want to keep reading, but I was wrong. It turned out to be intriguing and it captivated my mind and made me wanting to come back for more.My personal favorite story of the entire book was the first chapter, The Veldt. In the beginning I did not understand the whole story, but after finishing it, I realized it caught my eye and made me wonder. It made me think on a whole differnet level than I was used to and opened my mind to various thoughts. I also have a favorite quote from The Concrete Mixer;\\"War is a bad thing, but peace can be a living horror.\\" I particularly liked this quote because it summed up the whole idea of war that the author was trying to portray throughout the entire book.I do recommend that this book be a required reading based on the fact that most of my friends that have read this book found it interesting and fun to read. Now how many books can you say that about? This was a fun book to read and I am sure others will feel the same way."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is an exemplary novel. It contains mixtures of everything-starting with irony to imaginations then to very descriptive and vivid scenes. Every tale expresses its own sense of character and reveals to me what the author depicted. I felt pure bliss when I read each and every anecdote because the descriptions were so enthralling and alluring. The novel was enchanting and I was able to paint every vision as keen and vibrant as the inks that permanently stained the body.The entire novel held an immense amount of powerful passages. Out of those provocative quotations, my all-time favorite one was: '...the pungent odor of Jupiter on a returning father's clothing.\\" Even though I read this phrase over numerous of times, I can never grow tired of reading it. Every time I read it, I experience a new sensation-each time the picture gets more vivid and vivid. Bradbury describes everything ardently and keenly; it gives the readers a yearning to read more.In the world, there are plethora of breathtaking novels and books. Nevertheless, there is not a novel as exhilarating as The Illustrated man. As I mentioned above, each and e very part of the book is filled with endless descriptions that capture the readers' attention throughout the whole book. Once you commence to read this novel, you will incessantly thirst and crave for more. I recommend this invigorating novel to everyone."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I like reading science fiction, but I have to say that the Illustrated man is one of the most bizarre books I've ever read and it's a good book because of it. The ideas are very new, but have basic concepts behind them such as the effects of hatered and greed among others. It was also an easy book to read. The scentences were very direct and not long, drown out and flowery, which also made reading it a pleasure. The dialoge is for the most part very realistic which helps draw the reader into the story. There are many good characters, but so many seem the same that it's a bit dificult to distinguish between all of them once your done reading the book. Only a few really stick out. Some stories are better than others, but ultimately they're all very well written and flow smoothly. I really liked the irony in every story. The only promlem is that after some stories there's such a jerk right into the next one that you sort of have to take a few minutes to digest one story before moving on to the next.Ultimately this is a very good book as well as a very intriguing one. It really makes you think and see things from a diferent perspective. I had no particularly favorite quotes, but I think that everyone should read the book, if only to get a different perspective. It ties right into real life and even though the stories are far fetched many seem really realistic. It's a good book with good morales and a diferent view."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I must start off by saying that I don't usually read science fiction books because they are too unreal for me to believe. Reading \\"The Illustrated Man\\" helped me to change my perspective. At first, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy reading a book that was around fifty years old, but as I began to read the first short story, that all changed. The beginning of this book proved to me that it wasn't as unrealistic as I thought it would be. I could visualize the characters and the location of the story by all of the well-written descriptions. I was also glad to know that this wasn't a novel like most books are these days, but a series of short stories instead. If I don't happen to be enjoying one of the short stories, it helps me to know that if I finish it, there is a whole new story to be read that will interest me later on.My overall opinion on this book is that it really makes you think and ask questions. For example, \\"The Highway\\" has a very confusing ending that makes you wonder what the author of the book is trying to say. Nonetheless, I enjoyed getting the opportunity to read a book that has so many short stories taking place in the future or in space on different planets other than Earth. It makes you realize how people in the 1950's thought what the future would be like in forty years. Some of the short stories even take place one hundred years from now! All of the diffenent stories and locations make this book one of the most interesting books I have ever read.In conclusion, I feel that this book should be required reading because it is a type of book that most kids these days don't read. It is also a great way to open up your imagination. It is not only a great piece of literature, but it is also a great educational experience. By not reading this book, you would be missing out on amazing adventures. It is a wonderful series of short stories and it is one of those books that you start out being forced to read, but as you go along, you want to read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I found the Illutrated Man to be a wonderful book with many stories that taught lessons and had its own theme and moral. Even though most of the book was science fiction it can really relate to what we have to go through in everyday life. It shows the nature of humans and how greed and selfishness can affect the way we act towards others.What I really enjoyed most throughout my time of reading was that most events were unexpected. Also for those who really like to take pleasure in reading a wide variety of stories that have different morals, about different situations in life, should read this book. This book gave vivid ideas about what we may go through in the future. I believe that this was a great book and that it should be used for future reference."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book is fabulous! Never since my early childhood did a book influence my life. I enjoyed the wide variety of main characters, each with their own faults and virtues. It was very easy to link these characters to my own life and catch a glimpse of what obstacles may be in my future. Also, I like the fact that it was easy and imaginative. Most of the stories contain a twist that kept me in suspense until the very end. Those complaining about lenght have nothing to fear because the words are easy so reading long paragraphs can even take under a minute to complete.I recommend this novel for required reading because this novel contains many purposeful themes. Unfortunately, I cannot put my favorite meaningful quote here because it spoils a story but it changed my life! I saw how miserable a man became and I realized that the way he led his life is almost like mine; I did not want to share his depressing fate."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I thought that the book The Illustated Man By Ray Bradbury, was alright. The first few stories were really interesting to me, then as I started to read more and more I sort of found it uninteresting. I don't know why, but I could really see that Bradbury was a very talented writer, he uses excellent imagery, and visual descriptions and a very vivid, large vocabulary that he had, but I just seemed to not understand a lot of what he was saying in some chapters. Though near the end of the book, the chapters seemed really great, I just liked reading the more adventure stories than the sci-fi, and most of his stories seemed sci-fi.My favorite qoute is from \\" The Fox and the Forest,\\" when a voice said, \\" The rabbits may hide in the forest, but a fox can always find them.\\" I like that qoute the best because it just relates to life to me atleast, because in a way it sort of says that you can't always hide from your problems or you can't hide from someone, because your problem is bound to reveal itself sooner or later. I don't really think The Illustrated Man should be required reading, there doesn't seem to be much in it, other than a large vocabulary, and though the stories have meanings that can relate to life experiences, I think people can find much more relief and in some ways educate themselves in other works. The Bible is a very good book to take, and that is actually the kind of book I would much rather want to read as required reading, though it doesn't all have to be read at once,it can be read slowly and patiently over a life time of course, but not just the Bible, even though that really is the best book, ever. Classic stories like A Tale of two Cities, By Charles Dickins, or even Oliver Twist, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,and those kinds of books, I think hold much more meaning, and more realistic characters and, I feel like I can relate more to stories like that, and the Bible of course."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The book, The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, is one of the most interesting Sci-Fi books I have read. Bradbury truly had a vision, to send man into the far parts of space. And he helped us capture that image. Showing what it may be like on the planet Mars, or Venus. At the same time, he wrote a lot of fictional stuff. Like, robots doing our daily chores for us, or just doing stuff that we can normally do ourselves. He has captured life taken over by machines.Who would have thought, that this book would have been such a life teacher. It has many quotes that we may hear in our everyday lives. One of my favorites in this book, talks about how we wish to be in places. When we are there, we want to be somewhere else. On page 71, the Rocket Man is talking to his son. He told his son not to become a rocket man. \\"I mean it,\\" he said. \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Don't start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\" I love that line, because I tend to do that sometimes. Especially, if you're a Christian. We can get hooked to this world instead of heaven. That's why this line could fit me.I think this is a good book to read. There are so many short stories, and many more quotations that could teach us about our own life. It's a good book for Sci-Fi fans, and for those who just like adventure with a moral in it. I recommend this book to everyone to pick up and read. I also gave the book a four out of five. Check it out at your local library, or better yet. Buy it here at Amazon.com, keep it and read it forever."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated man by Ray Bradbury. The novel was a brilliant novel which focused on a man who got tattoos all over his back . The tattoos moved and told there own story, and each one had its own story to tell. It focused on technology , rockets, and the future.The stories in the book that I enjoyed where The Veldt, The long rain , and Kaleidoscope. I enjoyed these stories because to me they had allot of adventure in them. These stories in particular, in my opinion , make you wonder about allot about things on different planets , and in different places.A favorite quote of mine was \\"This is Christ, in all his glory\\" from \\"Fire balloons\\". I liked this quote because it gives out hope. It gave hope to the men in the story. This quote gave them the courage to expand there ideas to others. It could also give hope to us readers.I believe that the book should be required for reading because it has many morals to the story. It is a science fiction book , and complicating to understand and times, but its worth the reading. Many lessons can be learned . I myself, enjoyed the book and do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury is a monopolizing novel about a man who got tattoos from this old woman who travels the years. The tattoos that the illustrated man has tell eighteen stories about war, death, and new technology the future will have.In my opinion, every single story tells me a moral that I can use in my life. I never liked the idea of future technology because it may make people's life easier however, at the end; it creates hates, death, and war. I may be wrong; however, those events might happen for real.There was this one amazing quote that made me think a little bit more than others. That quote is \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Do not start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\" from \\"The Rocket Man.\\" It tells me that he does love his family and thinks they are very special to him but not as much as the rocket, he travels together. When he is with his rocket, he misses his family and when he is with his family, he misses his rocket, the air of the space. It is just like when you are with this one thing, you get tired of someday, and eventually you go to another thing and later on, you miss the old one, and maybe goes back and forth.I strongly disliked this book because it is mostly about death, miserable life, and war however, I strongly recommend this book to others because by reading this book, they won't make mistakes in the future."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury is an intriguing novel about a man who has tattoos all over his body. The tattoos are not ordinary tattoos. These tattoos are unique. The tattoos have the ability to move. Not only do they move, they foretell the future as well. The novel contains eighteen short stories regarding what the future holds. These stories are flooded with war, death, and new technology the future will bring.Each story is holds a moral or lesson that we could all use in our daily lives. Technology makes life easier but it also encourages wars, death, and evil behavior. My favorite quotation comes from \\"The Rocket Man.\\" \\"Because when you're out there you want to be here, and when you're here you want to be out there. Don't start that. Don't let it get hold of you.\\" I agree with this quotation because when I am at home, I want to be somewhere else. When I am somewhere else, I want to be at home.I recommend this novel to people who like reading about science fiction and futuristic novels. The book is not always easy so you would have to read some stuff over. Once you get what you are reading, the book becomes really great and interesting.

At first I thought this novel would be boring and difficult to interpret but I was wrong. This novel was in fact alot more enjoyable and easier to read than I had expected. Although, I must admit, some of the short stories were indeed boring because it was either hard to understand what was going on or it just didn't hold my interest.\\"What would you do if you knew this was the last night of the world?\\" Pg. 90 This was my favorite quote because when I read it, it made me stop and think. What would I do? There would be alot that I would want to do and alot of things I would want to tell others. I like this quote best because it held my interest the most.When reading this novel, I highly suggest there be no distractions around because it is easy to get lost. Also I had to and suggest to really focus on what's happening because there may be some stories that may not hold your attention as much and cause your mind to drift. I think this book should be required to read because anyone could benefit from learining a few lessons that you get from this novel.Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel and the fact that it wasn't that long made me enjoy it even more."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is a good book but it has its flaws. The Illustrated Man is a good book because of the creative and wonderous images described in the story. The plot is also interesting and mysterious. However, the book can sometimes be confusing because all characters in each of the 18 stories are not properly introduced but are described later on as the story progresses. The Illustrated Man also introduces many charactersthat are hard to remember.This book should be required reading for several reasons. First, the book is full of great imaginative descriptions. This book is also short so some students with short attention spans can easily complete the book within a few days. Finally, although this book introduces many characters, the 18 stories can easily be remembered by almost any student."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury, really caught my attention.

Some stories had astonishing endings which really surprised me. It was really hard to decide which one of the stories was my favorite one for I liked them all, but the one that really awakened me was \\"The Other Foot.\\"This book is full of surprises and suspense.

The stories are told under a night sky by tattoos on the body of an Illustrated Man. These stories are so unique and interesting you will not be able to put the book down.These stories in particular, The Veldt, Marionettes Inc, and Zero Hour make you wonder where technology and the world will be in the years to come. These stories made me wonder if there really is life on Mars, or if it really does rain on Venus.This novel is one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read and should definitely be put on the must read list!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Even though I am usually not the type to read sci-fi stories I can honestly say I enjoyed The Illustrated Man, it gave me a different perspective of what the future might turn out to be and what we might have to reconsider in order to sustains the human race. The author, Ray Bradbury combined eighteen various stories, which might had had a morbid conclusion but left a clear message to be learned and probably live up to. The eighteen stories focused on space travel and the changing human mentality aided by the growing technology. The stories played on a man whose skin served as a screen for the illustrations and their stories.Out of the eighteen stories I read it would be hard to just pick one favorite story. \\"Zero Hour\\" and \\"The Fire Balloons\\" I found to be a little bit more realistic in some ways, while giving an enchanting spell of suspense. Ray Bradbury has an excellent way with words, leaving many phrases worth quoting. One of my favorite quotes was \\"And what happens next is up to all of us,\\" from \\"The Other Foot.\\"Sometimes books are not really worth reading, but I personally believe that The Illustrated Man is not one of them. The book has many life lessons that some of us need to learn and shows us that being nave may turn out to be a problem. It is also an excellent opportunity to try different genres that you are not accustomed to read."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If you like stories about space, about the future, or about faith, then i suggest that you read this novel. This novel is a recollection of 18 stories that each have different characters, settings, and morals. Apparently, these stories are drawn on the illustrated man. After I finished reading, I liked it and i disliked it at the same time. However, I believe that this book should not be in our school's required reading.I liked this book because some of the stories had morals that would help us in life. The story \\"The Other Foot,\\" reminded us of a cliche saying about how we live our lives. \\"Treat others the way you want to be treated,\\" is the quote that I was reminded of as I read this story. What I liked about this story is that compassion and kindness was shown in the end.I'm not going to spoil the ending of that story, so that's all im going to say. There was a quote in this story that made me believe that there will actually be peace without prejudice on earth one day. The following is the quote:\\"The Lord's let us come through, a few here and a few there. And what happens next is up to all of us. The time for being fools is over. We got to be something else except fools. I knew that when he talked,=. I knew then that now the white man's as lonely as we've always been. He's got no home now, just like we didn't have one for so long. Now everything's even. We can start all over again, on the same level.\\"I disliked this book as well because some of the stories in the novel had made no effect on me. Basically what I'm trying to say is that when I read them, they made no sense what-so-ever. Like the story, \\"The Veldt.\\" It had an eerie ending that had me baffled in what the story was trying to say. Depressing ending?yes. Well, for those who understood it.I wish this book had a main plot and main characters, but if this novel did have just one story, then it would have lost its significance."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Great product and great service. If my response must fit your specifications, I won't review any more ever again. Goodbye."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"A couple spoilers here, but only when needed to explain why I rated the way I did.The stories in this book are not related at all. In the beginning Ray Bradbury tries to make you think all the tattoos on some guy are all inter-related. After about the 3rd story, Ray Bradbury apparently forgets about the Illustrated Man and makes no mention of him again and it's just story after story until the very end when he's given a few more sentences. That doesn't take away from the book though. I like short story collections. I don't know why he felt the need to half-@$$ an attempt at making a cohesive novel out of a collection of previously published short stories. Anyway...The first story really caught me and set my expectations too high. The first story is the best and it's really downhill from there. Most of the stories are so bad I wanted to give the book a 1 star rating, but there are a few gems that kept me from doing so.\\"The Veldt\\" - Set in a future world where a family has a 3D nursery that will fully immerse their children in a world of their choosing. The parents begin to worry when the children begin spending too much time on the African Veldt. 5/5\\"Kaleidoscope\\" - A ship malfunction sends astronauts hurling through space. 4/5\\"The Other Foot\\" - Total Crock. Mars is solely inhabited by black people. White astronauts land and the blacks think about doing their own version of reverse-Jim Crow laws but decide to live in total peace and harmony and rainbows and unicorns and glurg and everyone gets along and things are wonderful because they are so much better people than white people. Total crock and blantantly polical. Shame on you Ray Bradbury. This story almost made me throw the book away. 0/5\\"The Highway\\" - Another political story about the industrialization of native lands. This one was better than the last, but still a bad story. 1/5\\"The Man\\" - Astronauts land on a planet in perfect peace and harmony. Because Jesus lives there. Seriously. 0/5\\"The Long Rain\\" - Astronauts stranded on Venus and it's constant rain. They are searching for \\"Sun Domes\\" to get out of the rain and into some artifical sunlight. Very good. 4/5\\"The Rocket Man\\" - An astronaut fights with the desire to maintain his career (and be gone for months at a time) or have a normal family life. Great story. 5/5\\"The Fire Balloons\\" - Priests take a missionary trip to Mars. Seriously. 1/5\\"The Last Night of the World\\" - The world is going to end tomorrow. With this knowledge a couple goes through their normal daily routine. 3/5\\"The Exiles\\" - Books are being burned on Earth. The characters of those books live on Mars. Seriously, Ray Bradbury is hung up on astronauts and Mars. 2/5\\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" - Two astronauts. One of them going insane. 2/5\\"The Fox and the Forest\\" - A couple travel back to 1938 Mexico to avoid the post-apocolyptic world in which they live. A nice break from all the astronaut and Mars stories. 3/5\\"The Visitor\\" - And back to astronauts and Mars. Mars is used as a colony for diseased people. One day a man arrives with the ability to transfer thoughts and provide the illusion of being in another much more comfortable place. 4/5\\"The Concrete Mixer\\" - The Martian army is preparing to invade Earth but are welcomed by movie directors who want them to act. What? 1/5\\"Marionettes, Inc.\\" - A man buys a robot wife because he is tired of his own. Pretty interesting. 3/5\\"The City\\" - Astronauts land on a seemingly uninhabited planet. I won't ruin it. I'll let the story ruin itself. 1/5\\"Zero Hour\\" - Children are playing a game called \\"Invasion\\". But it's real and they are helping Aliens take over Earth. Seriously. 1/5\\"The Rocket\\" - A poor man has finally saved up enough money to send only one member of his family into space. 3/5"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"A man meets another man who has \\"pictures\\" all over his body.

The first man spends an entire night watching the pictures in the firelight and the collected stories in this book are what he sees. A good description of these tales would be \\"science fiction nightmares.\\" They go a step beyond even cautionary tales to the greatest fears man has of aliens, technology, and space travel.Usually, when I review a short story collection I go through and say something about each one, but I feel that this is more of a cohesive whole than other collections, that I would be repeating myself quite a lot, and also not wanting to overdose on spoilers. These are also a little shorter than most short stories, but not quite short-shorts.

What drove me to this book originally was the film based on the collection in 1969 with Rod Steiger. It dramatized three of the stories and fleshed out the framing device of how the illustrated man became illustrated. I knew it wasn't a great film, even at the age of thirteen. However, it did capture a mood and it led me to check out the collection. This was my first introduction to the work of Ray Bradbury. I was fourteen and this was the most literate fiction I had read up to that point aside from required school reading of certain classics.Upon re-reading it, I found that I had no recollection of reading many of these at all so it was as if I were reading them for the first time. The premise is intriguing--a former carnival man turned hobo is cursed with a body full of tattoos which he insists are called skin illustrations that come to life as people watch them become dramatized. People are disturbed and see their fates; he loses another job and is disliked as the \`bearer' of the disturbing images. This is merely a lead-in to the collection of stories. The concept of paintings coming to life or telling stories wasn't new when Bradbury wrote this book and it continued with the premise of Rod Serling's anthology TV series Night Gallery (his earlier series Twilight Zone was also very similar to Bradbury).Many of the stories deal with travel to Mars and could be seen as additional episodes in the saga of The Martian Chronicles. \\"The Other Foot\\" is a more successful treatment of the black/white racial relations modified by Martian colonization than \\"Way in the Middle of the Air,\\" which was included in the original Martian Chronicles. In contrast to many of the Martian Chronicles stories in which the Earthlings migrated to Mars and modified the landscape and a dying civilization to meet their needs, in \\"The Concrete Mixer\\" Martians invade Earth only to be corrupted by a homogenized, crass, materialistic culture.Other stories in the collection deal with the unprepared for terrors of space travel and the unexpected challenges of navigating alien landscapes. \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"No Particular Night or Morning\\" deal with humans becoming miniscule flotsam in the vast and infinite void. \\"The Long Rains\\" tells of men trying to survive and retain their sanity in a Venusian world of perpetual rain.Many of the stories depict scenarios of virtual reality or manipulation of reality in some sense. One of the most well-known is \\"The Veldt,\\" which tells of a playroom for children that becomes a bit too sophisticated when the children are given too much control of it and facilitates the darkest tendencies of their fantasies. \\"The City\\" tells of an automated city on an alien planet setting a trap for visitors from an Earth it recalls destroyed its civilization.There are many brilliant fantasies in this collection and others that have not aged as well since the time in which they were written. Upon reflection I think Bradbury could have expanded the theme of these stories as illustrations and paced them a bit more effectively. The collection begins with some of the darker stories such as \\"The Veldt,\\" \\"Kaleidoscope\\" and \\"The Long Rains\\" but then the stories acquire a lighter tone, ending with the ode to the imagination \\"The Rocket Man.\\" On the heels of this optimistic story, the sardonic and sinister epilogue is a bit jarring. The tone is not evenly sustained or modulated throughout the collection. Perhaps if Bradbury had chosen to revise this book as he later did with Martian Chronicles he might have rectified this imbalance. Nonetheless, these stories survive as expressions of a prolific and bold imagination and also serve as potent emblems of the post-World War II era."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I've read many of the 1 star reviews of this book. And I repeatedly told them that to enjoy any science fiction, you must suspend their disbelief. The reader must judge the truth of what happens within the scope of the world created by the author, not by the world as we know it.Sure there are always going to be opinions and I take that for granted.Keeping in mind that Ray Bradbury has an uncanny way of introducing and writing his works, and his works bieng VERY odd. YOu find some brutal truth in this book, it's a difficult analogy to distinguish, but as you read the book, you see that he is showing us what we, humans, are really like, and not the side that we are exceptionally proud about.Agreeing with the other reviews, it is one of he \\"must-have\\" books, though not really considered a classic, it should be. It is not one of those books that transports you places like high fantasy. It's one of those books that you have to read and accept what is happening, then think alot about it.I thought it was an exceptional peice of work of Science Fiction i've ever read and I enjoyed it very much, even having to face the fact that there's a bad side to us, and you can't avoid it.Can you believe this is coming from a 14 year old? Well you better!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"There seems to be one misconception running through a lot of these reviews. The misconception is that The Illustrated Man should be viewed as a novel. It IS NOT a novel. I repeat: NOT A NOVEL. The Illustrated Man is an excellent work of literature, but it is a collection of loose stories. Even those who say that the stories have a loose theme are not stressing the point enough, it seems. The stories are barely tied together at all.The stories themselves are superb, and classic Bradbury. Among the best are The Veldt, about technology and what can go wrong with it; Zero Hour, about an innocent game that may not be so innocent; Marionettes, INC., a classic sci-fi story also about the misuse of technology; The Long Rain, a psychological roller coaster through the future of mankind; and No Particular Night or Morning, a wonderful philosophical story about space and what it can do to a man's mind.Again, you should view these stories as ones in a short story collection, not a full novel. But they are essential Bradbury and essential science fiction, like most of his works of literature."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"One hot summer day, our narrator meets the Illustrated Man. When the man strips off his stifling long sleeves, he reveals the Illustrations, which decorate every inch of his bare skin. But, as he warns the narrator, they are more than Illustrations: at night, they come to life, change, and spell out stories. That night, the narrator watches these stories--and each becomes a short story in Bradbury's collection. From living houses to ever-raining Venus to the Martian invasion of the commercialized Earth, these often-harrowing science fiction stories range on all topics and all skill levels. Some of the stories are incredible and haunting; others are bulky or uninspired. It is a mixed bag and not as good as some of Bradbury's other collections, but the framing of the Illustrated Man and the golden nuggets sprinkled within make it an imaginative and worthwhile read. Tentatively recommended.It is particularly difficult to review short story collections because quality can and does vary from story to story, making it hard to summarize and judge the book as a whole. The median quality of this book is not exceptional, and it is not my favorite of Bradbury's short story collections (that would be The Machineries of Joy and The Martian Chronicles, which is not quite a short story collection but is close). The reason for this is simple: some of the stories are uninspiring--neither harrowing or scientific, they're vaguely satirical but without cutting witticism, making them instead simply bland. These uninspiring short stories drag down the overall quality of the book.Some of the other stories, however, and the framing of the Illustrated Man, are simply brilliant. For me, these include The Veldt, The Man, The Long Rain, The Rocket Man, and Zero Hour, and make up about half of the stories in the book. They range from incredible concepts to haunting ideas to wistful, more personal stories, and are all written in Bradbury's clear, precise, honest prose.I recommend The Illustrated Man on the basis of these outstanding stories. As a whole, the collection is a bit wanting, but taken individually, there are definitely some stories worth reading. Fans of Bradbury's writing will especially enjoy this book, and the short-story format makes it accessible to all readers. And when it is good--it is very, very good."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Great to revisit Ray's works read when I was a teen in the 60's.

Yes I recommend this book because we can relate the book to our life.\\"The Illustrated Man\\" does not just predict our future, but also shows what can happen because of human nature such as greediness and selfishness. It shows that these actions may lead to the death of loved ones or yourself. An example in the book is in the story, \\"The Veldt\\", when the two children Peter and Wendy do not want their parents to take away the nursery room so they tricked them to go inside and the parents were murdered by lions. Therefore, these are the reasons why I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I think that the book The Illustrated Man is a fun book to read. It has many interesting short stories prognosticate things about the future. The author Ray Bradbury uses many descriptive words, that describe sorrow, happiness and suspense. By reading each story, the reader gets the sense that he/she is part of the story and not just a person reading a normal story book. The story begins with the narrator meeting the illustrated man. The illustrated man reveals to him the truth of his illustrated images, telling him that each colorful picture tells a story. Unable to hold his curiosity, the narrator watches it move.Stories about the future were told on his back, they were stories that taught people to watch for their actions because it might lead them to a destructive future. Each story has it's unique meaning and significance. They are great lessons to be learn. The book is not only fun to read but it is also warnseveryone reading it to becareful for each step that we take in our life. Every little step can change not only your future but the future of others too."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man leads the reader into the premises of the past's perspective of the future. As expected, Ray Bradbury created a quilt of 18 dark and chilling yet delightful stories that leaves the reader astonished and wondering how close this forecast of the future really is to the present world. This novel begins with a man meeting an \\"illustrated\\" man. This \\"illustrated\\" man has magical future-telling stories woven into his body. Bradbury creates captivating and vivid images that leaves an imprint in the reader's mind and thoughts.In the beginning, I was hesitant about reading this book because I do not find science-fiction stories to be enjoyable. Instead, I found a book that I deem to be engaging and pleasant to read. This book contained no particular quotes that stood out to me, but the ironic story \\"Marionettes Inc.\\" made me think about the possible problems and situations that are able to appear with the increase of technology. Though The Illustrated Man was an overall enjoyable book, I do not look too fondly to the menacing outlook of the future created by Bradbury. I believe that the Illustrated Man should not be required to be read. Thought this book contains many lessons that are required to be learned, it may create thoughts of depression and uninterrupted distrust."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"\\"Listen, Keep your ears clean, smell the smells of a rocket. Feel. Remember. So when you return you will talk of it all the rest of your lives.\\" The Illustrated Man should be required reading. Author Bradbury, Ray well organized eighteen tales, fill with life questions and answers. Although most of the stories were not carrying a person along, however it gave an astonished notion to people. The way he forecasted the future was closely related to the present world. It was also startled that he had thought of this concept and idea before 55 years ago. After finishing the novel, it made me surprise of the prodigy idea and richness words of Bradbury.I have an opinion that The Illustrated Man should be all state required books for all teens. I think it brings new views of teens about the coming generation."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"While this fascinating collection of short stories certainly has its share of interesting situations, many of them, especially toward the middle, were not as creative as I had hoped. Perhaps this is because I read The Martian Chronicles only months earlier, but it seems as if Bradbury, though a terrific author, dwells on the same ideas in all of his collections. I still found some of the stories enjoyable and would recommend this book to others, but it is not as good as The Martian Chronicles or Something Wicked This Way Comes."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Ray Bradbury vividly describes worlds where the inhabitants try to live and explain their own lives. He graphically portrays the nature of humans in their environment, and examines the future of the world"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"If you liked Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, you will love The Illustrated Man. This book is actually a collection of short stories, and while there's a main story (the actual illustrated man) it adds little value to the book and can be ignored. The short stories however are phenomenal.-The Rocket is a tale of father's determination to give his family a chance at once-in-a-lifetime adventure, brought a tear to my eyes.-Kaleidoscope and the Long Rain are great stories of human nature and loneliness.- Veldt is an interesting look at virtual reality and how we let the children be raised by tehcnologyBradbury brings to life new and original ideas - a planet waiting for ages to extract revenge on a race that was in war with its inhabitants, an alien conquest of earth via childrens' games, a man building a duplicate to deal with wife's nagging finds himself replaced...These will be fun for fans of sci-fi and classic fiction alike. Great stories for kids and adults, and excellent ideas to discuss in your book club or with kids."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I heard about the book because it was a book one of my favorite characters Dr. Reed on Criminal Minds really liked, the character liked the book and gave a brief description of the content. I thought it was a pretty good book. The individual stories were not to long and they all actually reminded me of things you might see on that series The Twilight Zone , ya know the really old black & white show from back in the day with that dude in the suit with the weird voice. So if you wanna see a persons view on different topics from back in the day or you liked that old Twilight Zone show your prolly gonna like it alot."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"Very diverse feel here, some scifi, some general fiction and fantasy. The stories are evenly well done."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"I think there are two types of people in the world--those who appreciate Ray Bradbury and those who don't.Granted, this is a short story collection, and, as is the case with any collection, some stories will be stronger than others. Every one of these stories is powerful and haunting in its own right, however, and I don't know of one single story that is the 'standout' in this collection...for me, 'The Veldt' is one of the top short stories of the past century--but 'the long rain' and 'fire balloons' are other favorites.others might say that 'kaleidoscope', 'zero hour', 'no paticular night or morning', or 'the last night of the world' are even more thoughtful, haunting or thought-provoking. and they'd be right, too. That's what makes the framing device of the 'illustrated man' and his tattooes so effective in this collection.... the darkness and unreality of these tales, their stylized nature, and yet, the way they stay with you.If someone doesn't like this book, they probably won't like Bradbury. For the rest of us, it's a classic."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This is Bradbury's best work. Many of these stories just knocked me off my feet. Especially the story about the hologram room. Chilling. He has a way of writing stories that do not evoke horror in the reader, but even better, shock. They don't put a chill in your spine with every line, but the readers know that by the end they will have the shock of their lives! I could easily read this entire collection again. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is the story of a man who is almost completely covered in tatoos. Durring the day, he can be seen as an ordinary man, but at night his illustrations come to life and tell thier own stories.In Bradbury's fifth book, he once again proves that he can take the mind where it has never gone before. Through elaborate detail Bradbury makes you feel as if you were in the stories. The wild, yet interesting 20 stories vary from the love and inspiration on Mars, to the madness of Venus' eternal rains, to a lonely death in space between worlds.I would highly recomend this book to all ages, for it is a fascinating book which leads the mind to wander and question. From adults to children this book can be greatly appreciated by all."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustarted Man by Ray Bradbury is a superior book filled with horror but same time class.

It merits the title of a 'Classic'."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"The Illustrated Man is an exciting science fovction book, filled with many short stories, one of my favorite stories in the book is the &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; a young boy named James finds out what it's like to be an astonaunt. A boy who never gets the chanced to see his father, but James heard about his fathers conflicts with his job and his family. Another story I have enjoyed is &quot;Kaleidiscope,&quot; this is where Applegate, a young farm boy, is looking through a kaleidiscope. He eventually finds a shipgoing down in space. You have lto pay very close attention to the book because it does get a little confusing. I would just recommend this book to serious readers and who are atleast 13 years old. This book klis filled kwith conflicts, such as &quot;Vedle,&quot; a daycare center goes bad, bytaking the lives of young babies, find out what happens yourself. I gave this book a four and a half stars, because it was very confusing, but fun.

I was disappointed to find out that the book was about the drawings on his body. It turned out to be alright, because of Ray Bradbury's weird and great was of conveying messages through a futuristic setting. All of the stories had a unique way of teaching a lesson. My favorite part was when the farmer said, \\"What world?\\", after the man said the end of the world is coming.I don't think this book should be required to be read for school. It is a good book to read on your own though if you wanted. The book is really random, and yet has a lot of important life lessons. If you were interested in human nature and the future it brings us, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Man","review":"This book was really great!

However those were the only things that I felt were well done in this book. Although the novel was extremely descriptive, it was also quite dull, leading me to only be able to read about 10-15 pages at a time. Several of the stories seemed similar because of the setting and they had the same kind of pessimistic and dark feel to it. Most of the stories were saying such things like the world ending and that didn't make me warm up to the book too much.I am not saying that all of the stories in the book were horrible, I did enjoy a couple of them, such as \\"The Veldt,\\" and \\"The Long Rain,\\" however the number of stories I liked versus the number of stories that I didn't are 1 out of 8.As much as I did not enjoy this book, I would suggest that it be required reading, because of his amount of detail and description, and his technique.

Cute pictures and attractive layout.But the contents are quite limited. There are several categories of phrases, including Time, Calendar, Shopping, Life's little emergencies, Hotels and room service. I compare the quantity of useful phrases to something like Berlitz or other phrase books, and I fail to see how this 'map' measures up.The few errors and typos (e.g., the spelling of sndag 'Sunday as sondag --yes that little line through the o matters! -- , 'mit pass' instead of mitt pass 'my passport', til Kanada instead of til Canada 'to Canada', kreditkort instead of kredittkort, \\"Snill\\" in the common expression vr s snill misspelled) will not hinder comprehension. But really ensuring that these few pages are correct would not be at all a bad idea. One more petty complaint: The English phrase is \\"I'm from the U.S.A.\\" and the Norwegian should match USA, but uses \\"Amerika\\". Better to have the two phrases match.I find this \\"Pronunciation tip\\" amusing:: \\"Pronounce the phonetics just as you see them. Don't over-analyze them...

I bought it, thinking I was getting all three stories (I had previously purchased Star Light, Star Bright by Anne Stuart separately), since I wanted the Maggie Shayne and Judith Arnold stories. However, when I opened the file, it was just Maggie Shayne's novella. So keep this in mind when buying the Kindle version of this book.

She is a woman who has had everything she thought she ever wanted, and still felt lonely at heart. She loses everything she thought was important to her and it has caused her faith to falter, too.

Asey is home on a few days' leave from his job at the Porter Tank plant, and his cousin-in-law Jennie wants to go to a local auction at the Alden house. John Alden died recently, and people say he had a lot of antiques and loose cash squirreled away in his house. Asey drives Jennie to the auction, drops her off, and then intends to relax next to a nearby pond. But his leisure is broken by the sight of a young woman tossing books into the water. And then Gardner Alden, brother of the deceased, stops by the pond to wash his hands in it, when he really should have been attending the auction. Both acts seem suspicious to the amateur detective. As well they should.When Asey returns to town to pick up Jennie, he learns that the auction didn't turn out the way folks expected. Solatia Spry, a Cape woman who was said to be an antiques buyer for a rich client in California, never showed up to bid at the auction. And Gardner Alden paid the astronomical amount of three thousand dollars for an old sea chest that supposedly just had books in it. But the chest is locked and the key is missing. Because Asey owns a lot of keys, Jennie offers his assistance and the chest is brought to the Mayo household. Lo and behold, when they are finally able to lift the lid, there's Solatia Spry, dead from a single knife wound to the heart. Who killed her, and when? And why? And what happened to the books that had been in the chest? Asey is afraid he is all too familiar with the answer to that last question, at the very least.As usual, Doc Cummings helps Asey figure out exactly what happened and who was involved in the crime. As usual, the local authorities are less than useful in the investigation. And before it's solved, several men are biffed and/or tied up (including Asey), and a lot more books are strewn about the peninsula. It also turns out that Solatia was on the town ration board and had more than once refused a commodity request by an irked resident. Was her death related to the auction, or to something else altogether? It takes a lot of thought, a lot of interrogation sessions, and a lot of driving around (as always). But since Asey's got a time limit, he solves the murder in just a day or two -- by devoting his non-stop attention to the matter. We have to wonder when the man sleeps.This entry is one of the more intriguing whodunits in the Asey Mayo series. It almost deserves five stars -- until the denouement, which isn't quite up to par with the rest of the plot. Nevertheless, \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" makes for good entertainment for avid mystery readers."},{"Title":"Going, Going, Gone: An Asey Mayo Mystery","review":"The first war time Mayo mystery had a speeded up pace and was chock full of war time activities. This book is also set in the early 40's but the war activities seem to have become routine, so the story could be told in a manner similar to Atwood Taylor's earlier works with their amusing portrayals of Cape Cod characters.Asey is on vacation from tank manufacturing and is sorting fish line when cousin and housekeeper Jenny gets him to take her to an estate auction. Leaving her there, he goes off fishing, but when he gets home he's asked to open a trunk bought at the auction by one of the heirs. It contains the body of a local antique dealer who had failed to attend the auction. We're off with Asey wandering around, talking to a raft of auction goers, getting biffed on the head and left tied up, etc. The big questions are what happened to the money the estate owner kept in his house and what happened to the books that had been in the trunk before it was used to hide the body. The dead woman had been on the rations board so there were folks with a motive related to that as well as to the missing money and the antique business. As always, Asey cleverly sorts it out -- A recommended mystery from the classic era."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Theories","review":"Conspiracy Theories, edited by Kate Tuckett, explores the increasingly mainstream speculation that what we know about history is not what it seems. A quick read at 242 printed pages, this paperback has no pictures. The Editor weaves a healthy tongue-in-cheek thread through many of the seemingly unrelated topics.At the very beginning of the book, an important disclaimer states \\"The conspiracy theories expressed in this book are just that: theories. The editors and the publishers make no claim that any of these theories have any basis in fact. They are merely theories that have at some point been expressed in the public domain. Such theories are reproduced herein for entertainment purposes only and are not intended to be taken literally.\\"As a long-time researcher of the subject of conspiracies, I found this book to be mildly amusing. I learned a few things, such as the name of the individual (Billy Shears) rumored to have replaced Paul McCartney when he \\"died\\" while with the Beatles, but the conspiracies themselves appear only in summary form of 1-3 pages in length. This is not an encyclopedia, more like an annotated dictionary. I could have done without the overarching \\"Alien Conspiracy\\" theme that joins many of the entries. If the aliens were running things, they would not have approved this book! Conspiracies are the mortar to the bricks of history. Perhaps that could be a new educational approach to teaching history to young people: teach the conspiracy first and then if they are interested they will reach out for the \\"facts\\".This book is strictly for newcomers or conspiracy collectors.

To state the obvious I can't recomend this to anybody that likes to do real conspiracy research but I also don't think I'd send somebody who has a vague interest or to wake somebody up to this book either."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Theories","review":"Very different theories and bacvk stories concerning the many conspiracies that never cese to amaze the doubting Thomas in all of us."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Theories","review":"The Introduction to this 2004 book states, \\"Belief in conspiracy theories is more than just the belief in an occasional underhand plot. It is a belief system that asserts that world events are being governed in secret by a group of ultrapowerful puppeteers behind the scenes... Of course, one can argue that obsession with conspiracy theories serves only to demonstrate the lunatic paranoia running rife in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries... But in reality, history has proved all too well that politicians lie, presidents lie and bureaucrats lie. If we continue to be gullible and believe everything that is presented to us, the truth will never come out.\\"This 2004 book covers about 120 different conspiracy theories---or less than 120, since multiple theories are considered for several subjects (e.g., Princess Diana; JFK assassination). The subjects (arranged alphabetically) are given very BRIEF treatment (no more than three pages, and often one page or even less). They are considered with varying degress of editorial seriousness (e.g., \\"Santa\\" is told tongue-in-cheek).Perhaps the biggest drawback of the book is that is has absolutely no DOCUMENTATION of anything; not even any recommendations for \\"additional reading.\\" The best part of it is simply the large number of theories covered in such a small space. Even experienced \\"conspiratologists\\" are like to find a few they may not have heard of before."},{"Title":"Theological Fragments","review":"Henri-Marie de Lubac (1896-1991) was a French Jesuit priest and a Cardinal of the Catholic Church; he was one of the 20th century's most influential theologians, and a key figure at the Second Vatican Council.He wrote in the Preface to this 1984 book, \\"Although the texts reproduced here were all intended to be theological, they did not result from a fully developed body of teaching concerned with some central point of dogma or its history or from a long period of research on a particular subject. For this reason, I did not think that I could use the singular of that noble word 'theology' in the title without irreverence.\\"He suggests that \\"by limiting his interest to man, by refusing to take seriously the problem that man poses for himself, the humanist is, in the end, the worst of all betrayers of man.\\" (Pg. 39) He argues that \\"a theology that does not constantly maintain apologetical considerations becomes deficient and distorted, while ... all apologetics that wishes to be fully effective must end up in theology.\\" (Pg. 96)He offers the clarification that the Church's \\"power is never either directly or 'indirectly' a power over the temporal. It is rather a power in temporal matters.\\" (Pg. 213) He later adds, \\"when Augustine takes up the subject of justice, he is not attempting to envisage a State founded on evangelical justice.\\" (Pg. 244) One of his final reflections is, \\"Let us not separate the poet from the believer. The poet has much to teach us about the very nature of faith.\\" (Pg. 423)De Lubac's theological writings were (and are) very influential, and always worth reading."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture (Dover Books on Architecture)","review":"This book is rated the classic reference on Ancient Egyptian building techniques. It covers all aspects of construction from mathematical procedures to the ways the Ancient Egyptians drilled granite and other hard stones. Various buildings and pyramids are picked out as examples for diverse techniques as well as for the purpose of providing insight into how they were built. Although getting out of date with more information having been gathered during the past 60-odd years, it is well worth reading and having as a handy reference."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture (Dover Books on Architecture)","review":"A fabulously entertaining book, chock full of info found on sites in the 20's before sites were reconstructed.

Dover has done a good job reissuing older books in facsimile form. This is one that would be better if it could be updated in the light of several decades' discoveries, but it is good as it is.Not a page-turner, but then it isn't supposed to be."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture (Dover Books on Architecture)","review":"Clarke and Englebach are very well versed in typical accepted means of architecture in Ancient Egypt. Though without color Photos this book has many illustrations which do in some cases help you get a sense of the immensity of some of the projects the ancients undertook. One particularly striking section refers to an unfinished granite obelisk at Aswan. The time involved in such a project is staggaring. They do a good job summing up what the committees on Ancient Egypt have all decided is the norm but advance no further, putting in very few original thoughts. The book is also seventy years old, so many of the unexcavated sites they refer to have now in fact been excavated. The authors go out of their way on several occasions to assure the reader that &quot;pyramid cranks&quot; should be disregarded in all forms. They however fail to explain why. Their persistant knocking of the so called pyramid cranks becomes rather annoying because whenever there is a mystery the authors waste no time in assuring us that these cranks are wrong, even if no one knows who is right, the authors don't even venture theory in many cases. But don't get me wrong, this is a good book and will help anyone get aquainted with how most structures were built and what methods they used for quarrying and so forth. Unfortunately again, whenever there is an unanswered question, Clarke and Englebach seem more ready to spout rhetoric rather than entertain any original thought. I really recommend this book even if I have some complaints because as far as actual documentation of construction, this book does go a long way."},{"Title":"The Colonial Wars Source Book","review":"This is an impressive source of much of the very many little wars that surrounded the British Empire at the end of the 19th Century and the beginning of the 20th.It has an impressive Geographical Listing of conflicts and, relatively speaking for a sourcebook, a detailed history of the genesis of the conflict, political developments, the course of the wars and the ultimate outcome. Some like the Boer War, are pretty well known. Others, like the Candy Expidition in Ceylon and the Northwest Rebellion on Canada are less known.There is also a good description of the various incarnations of the British and Imperial Armies (Indian, Australian, Canadian etc.) in each segment. It even goes down into the detail of the colonial regiments in obscure local areas of the British Empire, such as Fiji and Ceylon. The outline of the original home county regiments of the British Army is also a good quick reference (for when you are reading Hopkirk and you need to reference to see who exactly were the 44th Regiment of Foot).The weapons section on colonial armies is not that exhaustive but it does have good references for those that want to know basic terms for weapons such as a &quot;screw gun&quot; and the what weapons were vouge at what time. Opposing Armies such as the Zulus, Pathans, Afghans, and Boers get their pride of place as well.The glossary is good with a plethora of Indian terms and native Indian terms that were subsumed into the vernacular of the Imperial Soldier.The one area that it suffers is the biographical section where the list of personalities is a little limited. Most of the people left out will be described and mentioned in many of the imperial conflict chapters but it would be better to have for example, more Napiers and Roberts in pantheon of Imperial Heroes and rougues.It is quite and accomplishment as the efforts of one person. Although I can think of ways it could be bettered, I do not know of any other effort available out there today on the subject."},{"Title":"The Colonial Wars Source Book","review":"Mr. Haythornthwaite have produced a splendid work of the colonial wars of the British Empire, the term \\"colonial wars\\" in this book is use only to define the British Colonisation during the Victorian period and not to all European colonisation of other regions of the world. The author have try to compress the largest amount of information into the smallest possible space without missing key facts of WHO, WHEN, HOW and where.This work cover the earlier campaings of the XIX century to the conclusion of the South African War in 1902(Anglo-Boer War). The text is divides geographically,the first chapter is dedicated to Great Britain(British Army, Royal Navy,British Ministries and Commanders), then we start with the Indian Subcontinent, Africa and the Mediterranean, the East, the Americas and the Atlantic, and Australasia and the Pacific. In every Chapter we find a brief explanation or outline of the military operations, the opposite armies with many period photographs, drawings, maps and diagrams. One of the final sections is dedicated to the biographies of some leading and often colourful military figures, like Banden-Powell, Wolseley, Kitchener and Frederick Roberts. You can also find the victorian enemies, the Mahdi(Mohammed Ahmed Ibn Seyyd Abdullah), Nana Sahid(Lead the mutineers in 1857). At the end there is a fascinating and useful Glossary of period and technical terms.This is not a complete work but a valuable reference tool for anyone interested in history, both military and political in the wars of Colonial Conquest of the British Empire."},{"Title":"Jackie's Got Game: A Story About Diabetes","review":"A sweet but honest story about how one young boy deals with the challenges diabetes brings and still lives life to its fullest.

Once again Piers Anthony has done a great job on creating a thought provoking master piece! A whole new way of seeing life. This book is a must have for those who enjoy a good book.

The whole series is great, but this one really pries into the life of Parry, and displays a lot of character. Piers Anthony is my all time favorite author, and this book is my favorite book of all time. (I haven't read And Eternity yet, but the first 6 are my 6 favorite books! My order of preference: For Love of Evil, With a Tangled Skein, On a Pale Horse, Bearing an Hourglass, Weilding a Red Sword, and then Being a Green Mother.)"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I think this book suffers from being the one that has to connect all the others together. Anthony didn't mean to write this one when he began the series, and it shows. To me this seemed more like a disjointed collection of anecdotes meant to show how Satan was behaving during all the other books rather than a flowing story. I guess it was necessary to move on to the (better, I think) And Eternity, but give me On a Pale Horse (in my opinion, the best of the series) over this one any day."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Of all of Anthony's Incarnation books, this ties withOn a Pale Horse. It shows a quirky, thoughtful Devil whois trying to make the world a better place in his own specialway. Anthony's subtle commentary on religon and morales in the modern erapermeates the entire work. Also, Anthony's signature Author'snote is present and as personal and informative as ever. A must read!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I came across this book at my jr.high library by accident. We were supposed to pick a book out for a book report, and I was trying to pick up a book on the first shelf, because I didn't care which one it was. Lucky for me, the author of this book has a last name that begins with &quot;A&quot;. If it hadn't I would've never seen it. I'd never heard of Piers Anthony, But into the first few pages of this book I just couldn't put it down! I was really amazed at the writing skills of this awesome author. Not only that, but this was exactly the kind of book I'd been looking for! I didn't do my book report on it, this was more for luv of reading than anything. But I was just so surprised. I'd never read a book like this before. At first it took me a while to understand the plot of the story, but I caught on. This is really a great book, and I'm reading the rest in the series. If you're looking for a book that combines the forces of good and evil, with a magical twist and eye-opening events, this is definetely the book you want to get!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I enjoyed the first two books of this series, in fact, I liked the first a lot. I didn't like the third, but a friend had given me this volume, so thinking it might be different as the &quot;normal&quot; Incarnations were over with, I decided to jump over the intervening novels and read FOR LOVE OF EVIL.I wish I hadn't. Though it was better than WITH A TANGLED SKEIN, it was still bad. Anthony is probably the worst player at &quot;show and tell&quot; out there. You know, how an author is supposed to show, rather than tell? He writes as if his readers are idiots. I nearly lost it when Parry took a swipe at the succubus and his hand got caught in her crotch &lt;!&gt; He even has to tell us that it's &quot;warm and furry.&quot; Pleeease.I don't know if his writing style had deteriorated by this installment or I simply wasn't aware early on, but by now it had gotten exremely irritating. The study of evil is inept; I can only imagine what the next chapter (which apparently dealt with God) turned out like. Fortunately I'll never know. Avoid!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Aside from &quot;On A Pale Horse&quot; after reading this i must conclude its my favorite book in the series.

Changed my life forever."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This was the first book in the seires that I read and it captivated me. My cousin said I should read it and boy was he right!! This was my first book by Anthony but after I read it i ended up bying evry one of his books I ran across. I find his characters colorfull and captivating. The plots are exelent (if a bit predictable) and I highly recomend them to anyone."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"For those people who have said that this book is the best of the series, I strongly suggest re-reading the previous books. I bought this book after reading &quot;Being a Green Mother&quot; and loving the character &quot;Natasha&quot;. Unfortunately, I found this book a let-down. Piers Anthony DID give a neat presentation of the idea of evil but the actual story line was disapointing. Half of the book was about Parry's past which is cool but the other half was basically a re-cap of the other 5 books. Sorry, but this book was NOT worth 5 stars!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Anthony leaves behind the traditional notion that the devil is pure evil and instead attempts to portray Satan as a sort of governor of hell, who is trying to make it better for its denizens. Parry, the character who takes over as the devil is a nice guy who basically starts acting evil once he becomes Satan. Even as Satan however, Parry retains some of his good side. As in all of the books in the Incarnations of Immortality series, this book has superb character development and an enthralling plot. This book was very enjoyable to read and I would recommend it to all."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"In the world of what might be the future of mankind, the great showdown between Good and Evil is about to take place. And it is Satan's intention to win. In perhaps the best of his Incarnation works, Piers Anthony has taken the world's oldest Antagonist, Satan (aka Lucifer, Scrotch, the Devil) and turned him into a great Protagonist. One great aspect is that it can be read as part of the series or by itself. It contains enough of the plot of all the work that a novice Anthony reader would not get lost. However, it is not a rehash of what has already been written. Because of the acute difference in viewpoint, it is a completely new story. Anyway, read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I've read all of the books in the Incarnations of Immortality Series and I loved every one of them, but this one changed my views about a lot of things more than any of them! Piers Antony 'humanizes' every Incarnation with attention to detail, especially Satan. He takes a very controversial look at life, death, after-life and our beliefs about them which eerily plausible. I also think the friendship between Satan and JHVH is quite interesting. My only problem with this book was the repetitiveness. It was nice to see the connections between the other books and this one, but it didn't have to be the entire dialogue written over again! Overall, I suggest you read this, along with all the others in the series."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"The young sorcerer, Parry, lived with his adopted father (who taught him the ways of magic), and his love, Jolie. This was in the 13th century. A crusade swept the country of France, devastating it, and incidentally claiming Jolie's life. Thanatos came to claim her soul, but instead, he let her reside in a drop of blood on Parry's wrist. Parry soon became a Franciscan, than Dominican monk. He was guided by Jolie's ghost, whom no one else saw. Afterwards, he became an Inquisitor. Something unexpected happened. Parry was corrupted by a demoness sent by Lucifer, for foiling all of His plans. Parry was then enslaved by Lucifer, but eventually over threw Him. Parry then became Satan, the new Lord of Hell; the Incarnation of Evil."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I'll be straight-forward with you: this book was without a doubt the best book in the series, in my opinion. I was anxious to see how Anthony would pull off a story about Satan without seeming like a Satanist. Of course, he did a perfect job! I was very impressed with this book. He perfectly captured the atmosphere surrounding hell and the legend of the devil. He piqued my curiosity in each of the previous books by having Satan make his &quot;cameos.&quot; He fully explains not only why Satan is evil, but why his role is important in the whole scheme of things. Very touching at times, and refreshingly brash at others, this book is one of the best you'll ever read, if you read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Of the seven books from Piers Anthony's Incarnation of Immortality series, For Love of Evil is better than all in the series with the exception of On a Pale Horse. Not to say that it is worse than On a Pale Horse but it is as least as good. For Love of Evil is a thought provoking and finely written piece of work for this genre. I do feel that some area of the book was left sketchy jumping years in advance leaving it up to the reader's imagination to fill the left out parts. But considering that Piers Anthony compacted 800 years into 383 pages it is understandable why some descriptive lead-ins were omitted. Piers Anthony was in top form when writing this installment. He is also an atheist, by his own admission, but has still used a very original view of how the age old deities conduct business.Piers Anthony's synopsis of Satan, AKA Parry, in For Love of Evil, is not necessarily evil, only evil by the accepted norms of the current society when the office is taken. Parry believes there is much evil in humanity that is none of his doing, and that the persons doing these atrocities slip though the bureaucratic cracks and end up in heaven. By the same turn people are going to hell for reasons that he does not believe to be sound. Because of these beliefs he creates a heaven in hell for these people, and sets out to try and work out a new set of rules with his counterpart who apparently is not paying attention.For Love of Evil has a storyline that could be read as a stand alone book and the reader would not loose any of the storyline not having read the other six books in the Incarnation of Immortality series. Sadly number seven, An Eternity, was a let down for a series of books that gave us an interesting idea, what if the immortals are just everyday Joe's."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Piers Anthony must have had quite the task to write this book. He had to take Satan that he had written about in the five previous books and give him a history and make sense of what it was that he was trying to achieve.What is given to us is not only a Satan with a clear understanding of Evil, but a Satan who actually cares about others. A Satan who actually cares for humanity. A Satan who is misunderstood by others.A lot of the mysteries of the previous five books are uncovered as a bet is made between Satan and Enoch on the fate of humanity. This also explains why everything happens to Luna and her decendants the way they do. At the end of the book, only one question is left open which is answered by the final book. But this work of fiction was fun and thought-provoking. If you've read the other five, you can't stop before reading this one. If you haven't read the other five, read them first. It makes this book more interesting."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I truely enjoyed this book. I actually read it when it first came out (circa 1989) and again now. Now I remember why I loved it so.I would suggest reading 'On a Pale Horse' first (as an intro to the series and illustrates how Satan is a jerk to the other Incarnations), 'Wielding an Hourglass' as optional (well written and gives more depth to Satan's character), 'Being a Green Mother' (Did not truely enjoy this one until I got to the last 4 chapters. When taking in the context of a supporting book to 'For Love of Evil' it enhances that story well.), and 'Love of Evil' last (the best one). (I did not read 'And Eternity').Pros: I enjoyed how Piers Anthony illustrated the humanity of Satan along with the reasoning and stuggles that comes with his role as Incarnation of Evil. Once you get past the first few chapters (slow story line) it just gets better from there. It really explains and ties togeather why Satan acted and did what he did in the previous books. It also ended in what could of been a extremely tragic and depressing ending on a high note. I put the book down after I've finished feeling good and that 'alls well that ends well'. I love how the main protaganist (hero of the story) was Satan.Cons: If you haven't read the previous books (or at least the ones I suggested) you can feel cheated as the author just summarizes the plots of the grand schemes the hero (Satan!) goes through in the 2nd half of the story. Do yourself a favor and read the others. Makes this book so much better."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"The sixth volume in Piers Anthony's &quot;Incarnations of Immortality&quot; series, &quot;For Love of Evil&quot; is the story of Satan. But this is not the biblical story of Lucifer's fall, as one might expect (although there are parallels to the fallen angel theme). In Anthony's magical alternate Earth, Satan is one of the seven Incarnations, offices which must be filled by mortals; and this story is of a man who was once filled with purity and goodness, and who became Satan.The story begins in medieval France, where Parry, a young man and apprentice wizard, falls in love with the beautiful young woman Jolie. Though evil is rife in this dark age, Parry abjures it and devotes himself to helping his fellow humans and spreading goodness. Then Jolie is tragically killed, and Parry, swearing celibacy, joins the priesthood. Here the seeds of his downfall are sown as the demoness Lilith tempts him into evil with the delights of the flesh. For a man who was once pure of heart, Parry's corruption and subsequent descent into evil is appallingly rapid. At last, he has become sufficiently evil to qualify for the office of Satan- when it becomes vacant. His subsequent adventures prove that good and evil are not always as they seem.&quot;For Love of Evil&quot; is not just a gripping story; it also reflects the author's philosophical musings on the nature of good and evil. This theme continues in the next and final volume of this series, &quot;And Eternity&quot;. After reading this book, you won't want to miss it!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"With Piers Anthony books, I tend to skip parts that get long winded. This book is no exception. I have really injoyed the Incarnations series, though after a while, hearing each character recap the same events got tiresome. This book drags like no ones business in the first 3 quarters, and then gets really cool in the last few chapters. I would have loved to have had the book written entirely about the events in those last four chapters or so, with a little more development. Anthony LAVISHES development on the (to me) less interesting beginning of the book and than kind of wraps it up in 2 minutes. All the same, a unique story line and twisting plot makes it a pretty good read."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This was a very well written book with a well thought out storyline. It had the perfect mixture of action, adventure, romance, and even a hint of comedy from time to time. This being a key book in one of the greatest series that I have read. I never really enjoyed reading until I started reading Piers Anthony. Some people have a problem with letting themselves be taken to another land by the story. They pine too much on the style of writing or how the plot is running. If you want to be completely released into a world of amazing imagination, then this series is perfect. This book did not receive a 5 from me because I felt 3 of the other books were more enjoyable than this one, but this one was still fun to read."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This book adds character and realisim to Satan, who is normaly shown as the guy who cares about only himself.

The book not only tied the others together nicely, it gave us a sense of Evil. Didn't talk about powers of Evil? What more powers you need than Illusion! Deception, subtle sin! This is what Evil is, not the climatic battle the Bible talks about. If I were to make a movie out of these books - For Love of Evil would be the First one, then follow it up with And Eternity!!!Imagine the controversy it would brew!The Devils point of view - the ultimate downfall of human nature itself!Problably the onlything that did prevent a &quot;10&quot; as a few others commented was the repetiveness of certain phrases (Nox) , etc.."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Have you ever thought that Satan has a point of view.

I've been disappointed by Anthony's other series - usually the first 2 or 3 are fabulous and the rest nothing but pale copies, but this book is an exception to the rule. I was very pleased to see the 'human' side of Satan, along with the rest of the incarnations. I am a bit annoyed with all the repetition in the book. Though it may be interesting to see the other side of some of those familiar scenes, I felt rather short-changed by how much was in this book. Still and all, I have to recommend this one, even if you haven't read the other books."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"For several years, I ate, drank, and breathed the Incarnations of Immortality series, much as I had previously done the same with Star Trek. I was 15. Even then, though, although I much loved the stories and especially the alternate reality portrayed in Incarnations of Immortality, I found certain aspects of Piers Anthony's storytelling to be, well, annoying. For Love of Evil even more so than most.The target readers of all of Anthony's books seems to be pre-teens, or any others with an exceptionally short attention span. He feels the need to remind us of things that anybody with a halfway decent memory would remember without his prompting. This is especially true in For Love of Evil. For example, a key character in the novel is Nox, the Incarnation of Night. Anybody who has read the book hardly needs to be reminded that Nox is the Incarnation of Night, though, because in the course of this single book, Anthony finds it necessary to TELL us that Nox is the Incarnation of Night, &quot;she who knows all secrets, and keeps most of them,&quot; at least SEVEN times. By the end of the book, we practically have her character description memorized. This is unnecessary. Worse, it's condescending. And it's what makes this story a 4, instead of, say, and 8."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I absolutly loved this book.; Piers ASnthony incorperated all of his other novels so they interwind together [pure genius!] The book itself is A class and if you read the other stories you can gasp at the recognition.

I demand that you read this book!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I've read many books by him, as well as other authors, since begining to read sci-fi, and I think this series is most definately the best one I've read."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"satan is supposed to be true evil, not a human being.

Piers Anthony cannot write. Actually, he might be able to, but by targeting the book and this series for young male juveniles, he is seriously wasting the lives of the trees that had to die for this publication.I thought the immature and completely tasteless sexual connotations were bad enough in the previous books, but this tops them all, combined! His version of Hell is totally unoriginal (copied Dante) and the plot is confusing, irritating, and boring. But I just got fed up with the sexual content in this book. If it was tasteful, I wouldn't really mind, but it's entirely juvenile and there's just way too much of it.Please, if you value your time, avoid this book and Piers Anthony like the plague."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"First of all, in reply to a comment before - if you did not read &quot;Wielding a Red Sword&quot; and &quot;Being a Green Mother&quot; it is hardly fair to comment on how good &quot;For Love of Evil&quot; is as this novel acts as an umbrella framework within which the previous five are slotted. Anthony's style, as usual, lefts a lot to be desired - but it is something you adapt to after awhile and, although somewhat explicit and left little to the imagination - it is a refreshing change from some other fantasy writers who can be so vague as to left the reader totally clueless to the plot. Having said that, I must say that &quot;For Love of Evil&quot; is my favourite in the series (yes, I've read &quot;... And Eternity&quot;) and although the plot can be predictable (how could it not!!! This is a tie-the-previous-five-togther effort!) I found it a refreshing and different view at a very old character.The novel was a good exploration of the devil and how he came to be - why would someone incessantly try to win a war against, well, God? Anthony did a good job here I think, to portray the Devil as a likable protagonist while not changing a lot of what he did - admittedly he acted to avoid the holocaust. What emerged was a very lonely man trying to do the most unappreciated job in history. After reading this book, I never thought of Satan in the same light ever again.."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I have all the other books on ebook format and this book and Book Seven aren't available in that format so purchased &#34;old fashioned&#34; books ;) ...

The questions he poses as Satan, and the way he runs things, really follows after my own heart on how things should be done. The punishment should fit the crime and those dirtied by sins not of their own doing shouldn't be punished to begin with. The rules of what makes someone good enough to go to 'heaven' are warped and really should be thought about. We won't even get into the emotional struggle that Parry himself goes through in losing his wife, fighting temptation from the greatest temptress of all, then taking over the spot of the greatest bad guy in the realm of man...when he's not bad at all. This many levels of philosophical ideals coupled with great writing has always, and will always make this book a Must Read Monday for me. ~ D. F.

Buying them all in hardcover was going to be way out of my budget so these will do nicely I think."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Mr. Anthony always did a great job with the preceding Incarnations as the philosophical questions, suggestions, and revelations of Death, Time, Fate, War, and Nature. A few books were better than others, but ALL of the books were at least 4 stars, and were all excellent reads.I was blown away by this sixth volume of Incarnations of Immortality and the development of Satan's character. It's a fantstic read, exploring good and evil and tackling some hard questions. The revelation that God simply wasn't listening anymore certainly makes a lot of sense when you think about how the world is today. Just like its five predecessors, this book is entertaining and thought-provoking. You just might get a few new views or ideas on things you believe in, these books are that good.Now onward to 'And Eternity', after having just finished this book, I am antsy to see what happens next. How exciting!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This is definately the best book in the series. I reaaly enjoyed the full series but this is the best by far. It goes a long way in explaining the twisted tales that is the series."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Go figure, Satan is actually a nice guy. This book is terrific, the equal of On a Pale Horse, in this terrific series. Parry, a sorcerer, passes through many trials and tempatations during the time of the Inquisi tion and eventually assumes the office of Satan. Any Piers Anthony fan should read this immediately."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This is the sixth book in a series of seven. And as with the rest of the series this book can stand alone or be taken and a part of the whole. Piers Anthony has once again written a novel that entraps the reader with the idea of the incarnations as people with faults and the stumblings of life that have followed them. I have been a fan of mister Anthony for some years now and have read the series many times over the years and still I am enchanted each time I read the Incarnations of Immortality. The detail and ideas are ones that can be enjoyed by readers both young and old. The book For Love of Evil puts a new spin on the idea of order of chaos. If you are looking for an adventure then I suggest that you look into the series."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Throughout the entire series, the main characters of each book try their best to defeat the devil with all his evil influences. And just like all the other books, this regular guy gets thrust into a messed up situation be becoming the incarnation of evil. He tries to make it right but the other incarnations are having none of it. Everyone believes the hype. This book makes all the others coherent. Read this tale! Great book!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"\\"For Love Of Evil\\" continues the \\"Incarnations of Immortality\\" series around the year 1205 as apprentice sorcerer Parry contacts a young village maiden to offer her a brighter future. A touching romance with outstanding character development and plotline organization without the logic-laced discussions and customary vocabulary (historically observed in the Piers Anthony series) presents what the preceding volumes should have accomplished.Where the earlier stories relate the struggles of the primary Incarnation on the initial acceptance at office, the author addresses the entire career of all the prior novels' nemesis, Satan. After assuming the Office of Evil, the immediate choices and duties of the Incarnation introduces a captivating domain mingled with the previous office holder's intriguing circumstances. The Incarnation of Evil's control over the realm of Hell is blatantly obvious to the position itself as to be laughingly applauded.Although all of the confrontations have been resolved beforehand to the reader (even if all of the books are considered stand alone), Satan's perspective provides fascinating insight why He made those choices and in retrospect improves the storyline of the weaker tales albeit too late. Satan's rationale to perpetuate evil on Earth might appear improbable nonetheless consistent as the Incarnation of Evil even if well rationalized.I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre. However those of a highly inflexible religious background or intolerant attitude towards religion might want to avoid the selection.Thank you."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Out of the seven books in this series, this has to be the most interesting. \\"With a Tangled Skein\\" is by far my favorite, but this book ties together all the previous book and helps bring more sense to them than you could grasp had this book not been written. Much like \\"Weilding a Red Sword,\\" a new view of Satan is uncovered, leading the reader to a deeper understanding of the natures of good and evil, which only grows with the final book. Anthony is not preaching to his readers, allowing us to follow and learn where we will. As much as I hate to admit it, being such a great fan of Book 3, this is the best of the series.While this is a stand-alone novel, much like Anthony's other series books, I highly suggest reading this one begining to end--it will help with understanding some of the later books, as this is one series that is incredibly interwoven."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"In my opinion it was a really powerful book and I would love to read it over and over again.

It's my favourite in the series which I have reread the most. A stand alone nevel as well as part of a series it is easily understood by those who haven't read the previous books. I lent it to a friend who has never read Anthony let alone others in the series but she understood it and enjoyed it. A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I found this to be the most enjoyable of the series. Piers Anthony takes the concept of evil and instead of giving us terrifing, false imagery, he is able to turn Hell into a very believable place. Perry is a convincing Satan,having fallen from grace after giving in to lust. Giving Satan a human background made it easier to understand, rather than having Satan as a monster. Anthony shows us that you don't have to be evil to enforce it."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This was the best of the IOI series. You are totally into the story. You feel Parry's anguish. Plus he's the Devil so its already interesting. He struggles with his role then he accepts it. Lilith added so much sensuality to the read. The best one I think!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This book was my second fav book in the series (&quot;With a Tangled Skien&quot; being my first). I highly recomend if you have not read the other books in the series you at least read &quot;Being a Green Mother&quot; before this one. Anthony does a superb job of showing a unique version of satan and hell. I will not get into plot specifics, I dont wont to spoil it for those reading the series. I highly recomend this book to readers of the fantasy/sci-fi genre."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"This is one of the best books in the universe. It explains for how the immortal Satan was in life, death, and beyond. It explains how he shakes the earth with evil, and even makes a deal with the Angel Gabriel. This explains why there is more evil in the world than good, and the purpose of life. It has much logic and isn't for a non-commited person. It's long enough to be satisfying, and short enough to be interesting. Piers Anthony did it again!"},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"I read this when I was fourteen years old, and it still sticks in my mind- which says something, given the hundreds of books I've read over the years. I still remember the shocking moment when I said to myself, \\"I like the Devil.\\" Talk about suspension of disbelief. This is a great novel, and Anthony does a wonderful job of creating sympathy for what is classically an unloveable character. I'm glad my parents kept their noses out of my books. I would hate to think what would have happened if they'd read this like parents read Harry Potter."},{"Title":"For Love of Evil: Book Six of Incarnations of Immortality","review":"Wow! This is a great book. The creepy thing is, the more you read, the more you start to *like* Parry (satan). This comepleatly changes your point of veiw toward the other books. When you read them, you know that Satan is wrong and evil and all that. Then you read this... and start to doubt... and by the end your rooting for him!Oh... yes, and it include my favorit IOM character, Jolie. That's always a plus."},{"Title":"Tirpitz: Hunting the Beast: Air Attacks on the German Battleship 1940-44","review":"John Sweetman's book is rather short but full of details regarding the British aerial attacks on the German super-battleship Tirpitz during World War II. Although he gives only a few details about the other trials to destroy that ship by Chariots and X-craft, the story of the RAF and AAF attacks is really compelling and very well told. Details of the weapons used are also presented, especially those of the famous Tallboy bomb and there some very good maps and a few black and white photos. The other side of the hill is also covered, with attention to the reports of the German Admiralty and the commanders of the ship. Overall, an excellent account of the determined and persistent British efforts to put that mighty warship out of action and get rid of a constant danger to their Arctic convoys, something that was finally achieved rather late in the war."},{"Title":"Where's what: Sources of information for Federal investigators","review":"Great historic reference to Federal investigation methods.

Not just anyone could pull this off--I'm not even sure that Morrow does--but just the fact that he tried gives him brownie points in my book. A biosphere is born to a new age-farmer couple, and they try to keep it out of the hands of the government. Life-affirming and planet-affirming.* Mark L. Van Name and Pat Murphy's \\"Desert Rain\\" -- Pat told us (in the NOVA Express interview) that she was writing this story with Mark, but she didn't say it was gonna be this good. An artist's construction of rain in the desert is hampered by her feelings for her husband and the home software he's creating. This is what Jonathan Carroll would write if he wrote science fiction.* Kristine Kathryn Rusch's \\"Precious Moments\\" -- Kind of an \\"Odd Joan\\" story, filled with this author's nouveau family angst and some really intriguing characters.* Peg Kerr's \\"Lethe\\"--This is a tale about medical and cultural responsibility for dying. It reminded me of the empathy of Theodore Sturgeon, and this story should be considered for the award that bears his name. I'm keeping my eye out for Kerr stories in the future.* Marcos Donnelly's \\"Tracing the Random Variable\\" -- A Twilight Zone-ish tale of a man obsessed with stability, that only serves to increase his instability.* Norman Spinrad's \\"The Helping Hand\\" -- It may be a little saccharine tasting, but who'd have thought that Spinrad would write a little piece of wish-fulfillment fantasy like this? I couldn't help myself; I like it.* Elizabeth Hand's \\"Snow on Sugar Mountain\\" - I was predisposed not to like this story by Hand, based on having read some wrong-headed critical pieces by her in the past, but she overcame all that, and this tale of an orphan, a dying astronaut, and their friendship was probably my third favorite story in this collection.And that's not to mention the contributions by Tony Daniel, Greg Benford, Ursula K. Le Guin, Wolfgang Jeschke, Karen Joy Fowler, R.V. Branham, or Michael Bishop, which I also liked."},{"Title":"The Dignity of Resistance: Women Residents' Activism in Chicago Public Housing (Environment and Behavior)","review":"The South Side of Chicago is well known for its impoverished neighbourhoods and its vast public housing projects. One of those, Wentworth Gardens, has a history spanning 4 decades. It is the subject of this book. The authors treat it as few housing projects anywhere have been treated. As a community worthy of serious study, with a history of continual struggle by mostly single mothers, trying to cope with a dearth of many things. Most obviously, jobs, for themselves and their adult children. Plus, the housing has a chronic lack of repairs. And there is a lack of nearby supermarkets and public transportation. The former leads to higher prices for goods that are available at smaller shops that do exist in the area. Which means that tenants of limited incomes pay higher prices that suburbanites.The book delves into these and many other facets. Which often unwittingly add up in a pernicious synergy to make a grim life even harder.In places, the book shines through with optimism. The human spirit, as exemplified by several of the women interviewed. The authors strive to be upbeat. Commendable, yes. Realistic? Well, you may have a different opinion after reading."},{"Title":"21st Century Complete Guide to Mars Exploration: Mars Exploration Rovers 2003-2004 NASA Spirit and Opportunity Rovers (MER) and the Mars Express Beagle 2 Mission (Three CD-ROM Set)","review":"Photographers and brothers Cornell and Robert Capa have often been considered as a salient study in contrasts. Perhaps their shared skill behind the camera could be attributed to some genetically endowed gift. Robert gained fame as the man who hauled his Leica equipment to battle zones from the Spanish Civil War up through the start of the conflict in Vietnam, giving war its \\"human face.\\" Cornell quietly established an impressive career that would one day earn him notice as his brother's near-equal but opposite, as the \\"Photographer of Peace.\\"Living in the expansive shadow of his brother the war hero, Cornell pointed his lens in the opposite direction, opened the shutter wide and produced a classic meditation on symmetry and light through his image of an afternoon at Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet School; of narcissism at the dawn of the Age of Television in the 1959 photo, \\"Jack Paar Watches Himself on TV\\"; and of everyday people at play, whether it was the early morning cold baths at Winchester College or couples out on a Friday night at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom.While combat photojournalists such as Robert Capa and Gerda Taro might have snagged the lion's share of magazine covers in the day - What with their work's shocking urgency and the tales of daring-do that accompanied them - there was a subtle balancing act at work. For every image of brutality provided from battle fronts around the globe, photographers such as Cornell Capa, and his contemporaries Henri Cartier-Bresson and Grace Robertson, offered gentle reminders of the beauty and joy found in humanity, be they a candid shot a young delivery boy haughtily marching across Paris' Rue Mouffetard with bottles of wine tucked under each arm, or a series of pictures chronicling the slightly tipsy patrons of London's Battersea women's pub on an outing to an amusement park, giddily holding down dresses on windy roller coasters and starting impromptu conga lines.In the early oughts of the 21st century, with images of mechanized carnage, bloodshed and war pouring out of every media orifice available, it's of no surprise that public interest should drift out to the cosmos and clutch desperately onto the prosaic, still images being captured on Mars, depicting gently bowed landscapes and baby skin-smooth rocks. But while such escapism into the wonders of the fourth planet out might provide temporary relief from the eye-strain of horrific imagery found here on earth, all is not in equilibrium amongst the photography community on the Red Planet.It's fitting that in our modern age the two brightest stars of the photo world should be robotic. However, while one of them is a true visionary producing images worthy of oversized, hard-bound coffee table books, the other is a free-riding loafer whose work possess, at best, flash-in-the-pan cleverness, but often lapses into tired gimmicks which seem designed to compensate for a lack of artistic ability and a minimal respect for the medium or subject.NASA refers to its two Mars rovers, Opportunity and Spirit, as twins, bringing comparisons of the Capa brothers to mind. Instead of two photographers in possession of comparable skills showing us different sides of the same world, however, we have a contrast in talent. Opportunity is a master of its craft, displaying the full knowledge of the rules of its art form, even in its cunning ability to occasionally bend those rules, often with wondrous results. Spirit, meanwhile, muddles in vapid self-consciousness, usually abandoned in the trenches of undergraduate programs at small, Northwest liberal arts colleges. Spirit's use of obscure angles, extreme close-ups and a grotesque use of color saturation are pedestrian, and it indulges itself in an unearned, over-the-top indignant artistic temperament, pettily shutting down and refusing to work as its colleague and sibling, Opportunity, lands on the planet.As these two up-and-coming photographers launch their careers among the Martian dunes, let us examine their work thus far, and observe the strikingly opposing trajectories of these two media darlings. One will be remembered. The other will diminish into a trivia question for game shows.On January 4, Spirit launched its career with a crude mosaic baring the self-congratulatory title, \\"First Look at Spirit on Mars.\\" Seemingly happy with the lack of competition on the planet's dust-blown terrain, Mars' premier landscape photographer falls into producing a pretentious set of self-portraits that are hardly on par with the Catherine Opie \\"alter-ego\\" series Spirit so obviously seeks to emulate in its own works dubbed \\"First Look at Spirit at Landing Site,\\" \\"View from Above Spirit on Mars,\\" and the obtuse \\"View in Front of Spirit.\\" Oh, it's always about you, isn't it Spirit? These images are not unlike the juvenile attempts of pretenders who insist on being called artists because they produced grainy photographs of their own feet that were displayed in some trendy coffee house in their hometown for a week.Over the subsequent days and weeks, Spirit has the exclusive luxury of being the sole camera jockey to capture the mystique of its surroundings. But the photographer seems to be adrift and unable to tackle the subject. Spirit is intimidated by Mars and cowers into the comfortable realm of moderate technical proficiency. Unable to offer up a single image that says \\"this, ladies and gentlemen of Earth, is the real Mars,\\" Spirit offers us 3-D stereo images to distract us from poor composition. Saturated colors and strange cropping techniques are employed to counter the lack of clarity and purpose that runs though Spirit's work. It's as though Spirit believes it can make up for its artistic shortcomings in the darkroom. While finding perspectives and angles that offer a wink and a nod to Chris Simpson's \\"Sun and Sand II\\" and \\"Atacama Desert,\\" Spirit's work contains no stamp truly of its own.It has often been opined that the United States should send a poet into space. While those who parrot this quip are really pleading for something more elegant than Neil Armstrong's clumsy, over-rehearsed \\"one small step for man\\" one-liner, that call might have finally been answered, at least in the visual arts, with the arrival of Opportunity on the Martian photography scene.In Daisaku Ikeda's poetic homage to Cornell and Robert Capa, \\"Eternal Voyagers toward the Light of Peace,\\" he writes, \\"A photograph is a consciousness painting, the instant's art that opens on the unbound vistas of the inner life.\\" That was inspired in equal measure by the works of both brothers. It would be difficult to imagine such praise divided half and half between the twin shutterbugs of Mars. When Opportunity landed Jan. 24, selecting the road \\"less traveled by,\\" on the opposite side of the planet from its sibling, Spirit went into a snit, shutting down and refusing to submit any more of its work. Almost immediately, Spirit apologists at NASA rushed to the premadonna's defense, saying \\"we should expect we will not be restoring functionality to Spirit for a significant amount of time - many days, perhaps two weeks - even in the best of circumstances,\\" and \\"we believe, based on everything we know now, we can sustain the current state of the spacecraft from a health standpoint for an indefinite amount of time.\\" Yeah, right. These cover stories as transparent as Spirit's deplorable aping of Robert Glenn Ketchum's work for its own \\"They of the Great Rocks\\" series.As Spirit wallows in self pity, Opportunity astounds from the get-go with a run of crisp black and white offerings. Consider one of its first images, \\"Meridiani Planium in View.\\" So sharp and barren, the photo's composition also pays subtle homage to the \\"Rule of Three.\\" On the left, the rover's mast is seen in its stowed position, but unlike Spirit's blatant self-promotion by centering itself in the image, Opportunity uses part of it's own body as a gentle lead for the eye, guiding it back toward the photograph's center. And while its close-up work (specifically with \\"Meridiani Soil\\" I and II) shows a playful agility at balancing darkness and light to reveal pattern, it is when Opportunity shows us its breadth by taking \\"First Look Behind Opportunity,\\" using only available lighting and its hazard-identification camera, that we are truly amazed. Utilizing the fisheye lens in the way it was intended, Opportunity renders what could have been a banal landscape, if captured by a lesser, with the intimacy and erotic electricity of Christian Coigny's high-contrast black and white \\"Le Reveil\\" nude. Playing with light and shadow, Opportunity titillates more with what it obscures than through what it reveals.And while Opportunity displays informed talent with its use of muted colors to show the stark reality and melancholy of vast Martian vistas and the solitary nobility of the simple, reddish-brown, wind-eroded stone, it is the magnificent \\"First Panoramic Look at Meridiani Planum, Mars\\" that will become Opportunity's signature work. With the sharpness, depth of field and the utter sense of contentedness it portrays, This 360-degree vista would not suffer in a gallery hanging among contemporaries, even next to the likes of Ansel Adems' \\"Mt. McKinley, Clouds.\\"NASA has sent two rovers to the Red Planet. Spirit arrived first, and overcome with fear and anxiety about the task at hand, turned in on itself, announcing \\"I am on Mars.\\" Opportunity came second, allowed the alien environs to take the lead, let itself be consumed by the landscape, and through the timeless images it beams home it proclaims, \\"Mars is on me!\\""},{"Title":"Squeezing the lemmon: A rock climber's guide to the Mt.

I have been interested in the methods of George Gurdjieff and his followers for a long time, and have tried to use their techniques of being intentional with thoughts and movements in order to increase my awareness and to experience the present moment. What was new to me in this book was the idea that it is possible to be intentional with attitudes and beliefs as well. The author gives many practical examples of how this can be done. Before reading CREATING A SOUL I wasted a lot of energy trying to figure out whether or not a particular belief was true, or a particular attitude correct. Girard Haven's suggestion is that since we cannot know what objective truth is, we can choose our attitudes on the basis of what seems useful for our aim in a given situation--always keeping in mind that the ultimate aim is to become more conscious. I found it liberating to realize that I don't have to know for sure that something is true or correct in order to try it out. The essays in this book are very interesting and make intriguing reading."},{"Title":"Creating a Soul: Insights from a Fourth Way School","review":"Girard Haven clearly has a very deep understanding of the 4th Way teachings. He seems objective about his observations and also has an extremely positive attitude. I recommend this book because Girard Haven has apparently gone beyond just talking about Gurdjieff's ideas and has become them. He seems to have really separated his sense of Self from his 'machine'. If you want to know what the results are of one man's practical work on himself over many years then this book gives a very clear account of that. His understanding reminds me of Ouspensky himself."},{"Title":"Creating a Soul: Insights from a Fourth Way School","review":"This book is an invaluable addition to the existing canon of Fourth Way literature. Whilst remaining true to the origins of the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky System and the basic principles of self-remembering and the non-expression of negative emotions, Mr.Haven talks about how to work with these ideas on a practical, everyday basis - and the Fourth Way is designed to take place in life, not monastic retreats. He talks about how to deal with ever-pressing daily issues and how to transform them into something higher, presumably, as the title would suggest, the creation of a soul. For many this book will represent a bridge between Ouspensky's brilliant, but somewhat intellectual presentation of the Fourth Way, and an understanding of how practical spiritual work on oneself can actually take place."},{"Title":"Creating a Soul: Insights from a Fourth Way School","review":"Creating a Soul by Girard Haven is about the practical work of the Fourth Way. &quot;Practical&quot; in this context means something more than physical or mental exercises that the reader can attempt in the privacy of his or her own study. In these pages, Mr. Haven speaks about the difficult, day-to-day work to awaken from the sleep in which we are all immersed. &quot;Practical&quot;, then, means both beginning to see things as they are and attempting to act from what one sees. &quot;Practical&quot; also means distinguishing between the efforts that one is capable of making by oneself and the line beyond which one cannot pass without outside assistance.The Fourth Way is a teaching of spiritual development brought to the West in the early part of this century by George Gurdjieff and Peter Ouspensky. It can be said that the Fourth Way, more than any other system of knowledge known to us in modern times, stresses the importance of work on being. It is not enough to know the words, one must strive to be the words."},{"Title":"Creating a Soul: Insights from a Fourth Way School","review":"This book is a collection of articles, essays, and editorials from The Fellowship's newsletter. I came into this book with very little knowledge of Girard Haven, his Teacher, or the Fellowship of Friends school. While some things could have been explained in more detail up front such as references to the Jack of Spades and Queen of Hearts, as well as, the creation of an Ark being a school aim... the context eventually provided me with a decent understanding of things. Plus, there's a handy glossary at the back of the book for easy reference.However, Creating a Soul really shines when it comes to dealing with the practicality and day-to-day struggles of Fourth Way Work. There are some moments which Gurdjieff and Ouspensky don't prepare you for. Haven's approach to teaching is attitude-based. With the right attitude, one can produce the right ingredients so Influence C can guide us through our perilous journey. It's clear to me that his understanding of what's required along all three lines of Work makes this an invaluable tome. A Teacher could have no better student than Girard Haven.I shall re-visit this book again in a couple years, expecting to find even more gemstones. Meanwhile, my soul grows stronger, deeper, and ineffable.

Well, when I began reading Mr Haven book I confess I did not expect much, but to my surprise I was very wrong indeed. His style of writing is precise, choosing words with such mathematical objectivity that one cannot help but fell deep the meaning the author wants to convey. And this is another important point to comment about this book: The fact that (as was said by other reviewers) Mr Haven gives an impression of someone who speaks from his being, i.e., someone who has become the words. For that reason alone, I strongly recommend this book for anyone who follows the fourth way."},{"Title":"Creating a Soul: Insights from a Fourth Way School","review":"I picked up this book from a table somewhere and found it a truely interesting read!

With hundreds of huge pages completely filled with Giotto's Padua paintings, this book is a must for any art lover and will inspire those unfamiliar with art to become art lovers. NOTE: the reproductions are Post-restoration and all the more beautiful because of this."},{"Title":"Giotto: Frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel","review":"You'll find here a complete presentation of all of the pictorial cycles at the Scrovegni Chapel: The stories of Joachim and Anne, the stories of the Virgin, the stories of the Life of Christ, the Passion of Christ, Vices and Virtues, and the Last Judgment. Even more important Skira provides in full color, full page detail after full page detail of each story. Usually its six pages of details for a particular story, but for The Crucifixion and The Lamentation we are treated with ten pages of details. Unfortunately there are not any details of the flock of suffering angels in The Lamentation. Another quibble, details would be welcome in the presentation of the exquisite Vices and Virtues---I'm sure Charles Swann would agree. But those specks of dust aside, this is what an art book should be, about 400 out of its 450 pages are color plates.The frescoes themselves are masterworks of organization, composition, color, detail and invention. Some examples of Giotto's genius are his making the Star of Bethlehem a comet, and the special use of real sunlight in the Last Judgment. You have to love his 3-D nimbuses, cant tell a saint without a nimbus. Some of the images are terrible to see: the pile of children slaughtered by Herod; Giotto's Hell where sexual organs are exposed and mutilated by hairy winged demons, and in one case, eaten by a green marsupial. As I wrote above, the book isnt all pictures, there are 50 pages of scholarly essays about the restoration of the frescoes and the pictorial cycle. It's regrettable that portions of Giotto's brilliant artistic achievement were in such bad shape and were in danger of being lost; just one more reason to shake our fist and cuss out Time (and water vapor)."},{"Title":"Can Survive","review":"\\"Can Survive\\" was written to provide cancer survivors (those who have completed successful treatment) with a road map to life after physical recovery from the disease. The obstacles facing survivors are surprisingly plentiful, and many are not obvious either to survivors or to friends and family members. The chapters of practical advice in areas such as insurance, employment, and residual effects of treatment, are thorough and helpful. Because of ignorance, discrimination, poor communication, and other factors, it is crucial that the survivor venture back into the mainstream with a tool kit of strategies, and \\"Can Survive\\" provides those tools in an effective and well-organized manner. This book would be the finest present I could imagine to give to a patient leaving the hospital after being pronounced \\"cured\\", and I believe it would be an excellent idea for hospitals to do just that.The book discusses serious issues that arise after primary treatment is complete, and it therefore deals with some difficult topics. Despite this, &quot;Can Survive&quot; maintains its empathetic and positive tone throughout. Many of the personal vignettes of survivors are troubling and can leave one thoroughly disappointed in the \\"system\\". In my opinion, Susan Nessim's most important achievement with \\"Can Survive\\" is that she guides the reader through these minefields with a gentle touch, and with the clear assurance that others have experienced, and conquered, the same problems. This book contains both important practical information that can be put to immediate use and an optimistic, tenacious spirit that enables the fight. Besides being an invaluable resource to survivors themselves, it should be required reading for friends or family striving to understand the experience of their survivor, and to help him or her negotiate the unexpectedly perilous shoals of post-treatment life."},{"Title":"Can Survive","review":"I purchased this item after my husband was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 40. He has malignant melanoma. This is the only book he has needed to answer many of his concerns. The information is easy to read and understand. My husband is amazed at how the book is answering the exact things he needs to know or are concerns at the top of his list.For example, he was dealing with the impact of the diagnosis and how it can affect family relationships. The book addressed those topics in the next chapter that he read. It gave him answers and a sense that what he was going through was normal.I would recommend this book to anyone that has been diagnosed with cancer or knows someone who has. It serves to benefit both."},{"Title":"The Criminal Lifestyle: Patterns of Serious Criminal Conduct","review":"This book was written several years ago, but is still current and valuable for any student of criminology or for those who work with the criminal population. Dr. Walters provides a clear overview of the current theories of criminal behavior, compares and contrasts them, then presents his own assessment of the criminal thinking styles. He presents this in a thin, well-written volume, easy enough for a novice to understand, but so packed with information on criminal theory that the most experienced practitioner would find it interesting and informative. This book \\"has it all\\" in terms of content and readability without being dry or completely theoretical. I couldn't put it down once I started it!"},{"Title":"Great Grammar Mini-Books (Grades 3-6)","review":"This book is a great resource for every language teacher. It contains a lot of interesting acitivities for students to do and to learn parts of speech, sentence structure, contractions and more.

The fun activities help students easily understand the main idea of some essential grammar. Teaching grammar becames a fun thing to do. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that while you are reproduce the material in the book, you have to pay special attention to make your two-sided copy exectly located in the same position as the original book; or you might encounter problems while you are folding, and doing the poo-up part."},{"Title":"Great Grammar Mini-Books (Grades 3-6)","review":"Great Grammar Mini-Books give hours of fun as students make these useful mini-books.

Not at all. It is what it advertises--a book about making Web sites useful for its visitors.But I've noticed something... In all of my engagements as an IA, my responsibilities routinely went beyond &quot;just&quot; information architecture into interface design and, yes, usability. I've not only been expected to organize and structure the information of a site, but to ensure that it is readily usable. My hunch is that this is true for most IAs. Most projects simply don't have the budget to support both an IA and a usability expert. Hence the IA is often expected to wear multiple fedoras. And that's why Usability for the Web would have been so helpful when I was a rookie.I knew I would like the book almost from the outset. Under a large heading &quot;Web Sites for People,&quot; the authors write&quot;Users need to be considered early and often. Usability needs to be a part of every step of the design process. Our approach is pervasive usability--integrating usability into everything we do. Our philosophy is that usability should not be an add-on, but that everyday processes should be modified to be user-centered.&quot;Do I hear a hearty &quot;Amen&quot; from the congregation?From there--in nearly 500 pages--the authors embark on a detailed exploration of the process of Web-design-cum-usability. Define the audience and platforms. Conduct user needs analysis. Complete task analyses. Create information architecture. All the way to post-launch usability evaluations. This is a complete survey and would make an ideal textbook.While the authors' presentation is thorough and fairly comprehensive, it doesn't break new ground. You won't discover any gee-whiz methods or fascinating new insights here--although there is an excellent and long-needed chapter on how to write for the Web.No, the value of Usability for the Web is how it puts all the pieces together in a very coherent whole. It even has its own little Web site where you can peruse the table of contents and download PDF copies of the various forms the authors recommend.A couple quibbles... For such a well-organized book, it can be difficult to determine where to find specific topics. Information on navigation, for example, is scattered across two widely separated chapters (Information Architecture and Design Elements). Fortunately, this can be overcome by use of the excellent index.And when I said Usability for the Web would make an ideal textbook, that was a mixed compliment. Unfortunately, the prose definitely has that, um, &quot;textbook&quot; flavor. I took it with me to jury duty and found that I would doze off after a couple of chapters. That's not to say it's poor reading--just that it's to the point, quite clear and lacking in zing. And that's OK.Usability for the Web will have a prominent place on my bookshelf--ready for quick reference when I have a question or need an idea. I recommend it for your bookshelf too!"},{"Title":"Usability for the Web: Designing Web Sites that Work (Interactive Technologies)","review":"This is a serious book about a serious subject: usability. The authors practice what they call pervasive usability, where usability is factored into every stage of the Web site design process. This integrated approach to usability saves money by catching problems early in the design life cycle at a point where changes are much cheaper. This results in highly usable sites that are simple, consistent, aesthetically pleasing, and profitable.This book is more than a usability guide. It is more a handbook for design teams. It has both great breadth and great depth, covering the gamut of usability-related topics like task analysis, information architecture, page layout, and web writing and gives useful details not found in similar books. That knowledge stems from the authors' extensive real world and academic experience as part of both Ann Arbor-based Diamond Bullet Design, and disciples of the University of Michigan's school of human-computer interaction. Throw in some cognitive psychology for good measure, and you've got a rare combination of skills.The authors have done us a great favor. They've distilled their design process into this book, complete with checklists, optimal processes, and techniques that design teams can use to improve or rework their existing design processes. The authors say that only through a logical, reasoned, and structured process can truly excellent and usable sites be created.The design process acts as the outline for their book:* Requirements Analysis* Conceptual Design* Mockups &amp; Prototypes* Production* LaunchEach stage is iterative, where time and budget allows. The book expands on each stage of the design process. Actual production is only a small portion of the overall site design process.The process of design is usually about choosing tradeoffs that yield the best solution. Since most site design projects have a limited budget it's better to leave off some nonessential features than omit usability from your projects. Sites with poor usability inevitably fare worse than sites with good usability. By following the authors' recommendations your site can be one of the few that is highly usable.

You can get literally all the details of usability testing practices in this book, as well as how to run them. And good amount of pages are spent for user needs analysis and task analysis as the first steps explaining Web site engineering approach.When reading this book, my first impression was that many worksheets, checklists and forms were included throughout this book:- Client Interview/Web Site Information Worksheet- Goals checklist- Sample of Web survey- Focus Group Preparation Worksheet- Information Architecture Review Checklist- Mockup Checklist (in Envisioning Design)- Mockup Style Review Form (in Envisioning Design)- Writing Guidelines Checklist (in Web page writing)- Form for Brainstorming Icons- Form for Testing Whether an Icon Is Recognizable- Problem Report and Resolution Form (in Pre-Launch)- Problem Summary Report (in Pre-Launch)- Postproduction Checklist- Web Site Final Approval Form- Minimal Maintenance Checklist- A Detailed, General-Purpose Checklist (for Inspection)- User Testing Preparation Worksheet (for Evaluation)- Typical Testing Script (for User Testing)- Consent Form (for User Testing)These materials are really helpful in conducting actual usability testing to get effective results. And many concepts are also categorized, organized, and explained in a lot of tables.In engaging Web usability testing, the most important thing is to understand your audiences. This book contains very specific way of putting them into action using scenario approach. The most impressive approach of this book is in enumerating user characteristics as seven user navigation models:1. Omnipotent model: Because people have perfect knowledge, they donft err in any way.2. Most rational model: People click interesting links only.3. Minimum effort model: People behave in ways with least mental efforts.4. Mental map model: First, people build their mental map according to the Web site structure. They donft use navigation in that site which doesnft fit with their mental map.5. Repeat fixed ways: People like his own way. They repeat their fixed ways irrespective of their inefficiency.6. Get nearby information: When handy resources are found nearby, people use them and donft go outside.7. Cost-performance approach: Best strategy will be determined by this cost-performance approach.One more important practice to develop a Web site that really works is to consider the gInternational Differencesh such as languages, units, symbols, currencies, date &amp; time, and conventions. These points are correctly addressed in this book to make your Web really workable in the international grounds as well.This book is a really remarkable work from the point of usability practices.

Its measured rising and falling cadences would grace the catalog of Franz Schubert or any of the other great classical vocal composers.Malachy McCourt, brother of novelist Frank McCourt (ANGELA'S ASHES) and a well-known writer and radio-TV luminary in his own right, has produced a curious little book of less than 95 pages about the famous tune and its well-known lyrics. His book is part history, part speculation, part myth and part personal editorial essay. And it is not free from touches of Irish blarney.McCourt's findings may surprise --- and dismay --- many. The great tune, long since adopted as a kind of unofficial Irish national anthem, may not be of Irish origin. A folklorist named Jane Ross supposedly first noted it down around 1851. She reportedly heard it played by a blind fiddler, Jimmy McCurry, in Limavady, Londonderry --- but there is at least a possibility that the melody may have originated in Scotland. No one knows for sure. At least one respected musical scholar claims that the tune follows no known metric scheme for Irish folk music.Many different sets of words were attached to the tune after its first publication in 1855 --- but those that have become indissolubly identified with it (\\"O Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling, from glen to glen and down the mountainside....\\") were written in 1910 by an English lawyer and song-lyric cobbler named Frederick E. Weatherly, who probably never set foot in Ireland. They were actually intended for a different tune, but when Weatherly's sister-in-law sent him some years later the familiar melody from her home in Australia, he saw that it was a perfect fit for his earlier verses. Thus an \\"Irish\\" classic was created from a melody that may be Scottish and words by an Englishman.McCourt gives us this information straightforwardly enough, but he fleshes them out with a good deal of barely relevant material. It seems strange to arraign a book of 95 pages on charges of padding, but the complaint seems justified. McCourt solicited opinions about the song from Irish celebrities (including brother Frank) and speculates at length on such side issues as who is singing the song and to whom it is addressed (one possibility among several: it is the song of Danny Boy's gay lover!). The author's tone varies between straight historical writing and folksiness, including occasional cutesy use of \\"tis\\" and \\"t'was.\\" McCourt also grinds a personal axe or two. He thinks ill of those Catholic dioceses that have banned the singing of \\"Danny Boy\\" at funerals because it is \\"secular.\\"There are some fascinating bits of trivia here, however. Victorians hesitated to refer to the song as Londonderry Air because, to their prudish ears, it sounded too much like \\"London derriere.\\" Irish nationalists never use that title either, because they want no mention of London in the title. Wordsmith Weatherly was once in legal partnership with one of the sons of Charles Dickens. And another of Weatherly's lyrics was the popular \\"Roses of Picardy,\\" set to music memorably by Haydn Wood. Wood studied under the composer Sir Charles Stanford, who quoted \\"Londonderry Air\\" in one of his Irish rhapsodies. Make of that what you will. This is a curious little book, entertaining in its quirky way but almost undone by its relentless folksiness. \\"Londonderry Air\\" remains a musical treasure, regardless of its origin.--- Reviewed by Robert Finn"},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"I'm a sucker for Irish history, lore, you name it. I grabbed this book without a second thought (or glance) and paid the price. It's just not good. The idea is great and it appears that the author was offered a sum of money for a minimum 100 pages about the subject of the origins of Danny Boy. Well, there's no real story behind it so that leaves 99 pages which he fills with name-dropping, Irish history (not bad, but for a different book), and then the capper is a 30 page list of people who have sung the song. On top of all that, there's several annoying typos.Reread Trinity instead."},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"I was looking forward to a verbal journey.

I really do not care how Malachy McCourt feels about the President, but it really has no place in a history of the song Danny Boy."},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"Neither scholarly treatise nor lengthy tome, Malachy McCourt's Danny Boy is a short, but sweet, look at a favorite song. He traces, briefly, the history of the tune and the various words that have been sung to it; speculates on who the song's narrator is and what the story refers to; and, has several famous Irish and Irish-American people discuss what the song means to them.

More of an essay than a full volume, and while it contains some interesting anecdotes and observations, for me the author never really gets to the heart of Danny Boy, what it is about this beautiful tune and words that haunts people so, that resonates down the ages and brings comfort and sadness in equal measures to all those who hear it. Perhaps it is beyond the remit of any author though, even one as Irish to his bones as McCourt, to articulate the ineffable, and ultimately his story fails to truly convince or engage. A beautifully presented little book, but more style over substance."},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"An excellent book by an excellent writer!McCourt has awaken the intrest in all of us to get to the bottom of what this song is all about.I think he has done it, and each time I hear it ,I will think of this book,and of what the song means to me.Though there are numerous ideas about what the song means,who was it to and from etc.,he has shown that doesn't really matter.It is a song expressing deep love,and it can mean whatever the listener wants it to mean.I have dozens of versions and although they vary greatly I love them all.I am always happy to hear it by another singer whether a professional or just an ordinary person singing from the heart.As to whether or not the words were written in Ireland by an Irishman;it doesn't matter in the least,it's a great Irish song.When you stop and think about it,there's no way it could be anything else but Irish.Johnny Cash wrote &quot;Forty Shades of Green&quot; as he was flying over Ireland,a school teacher living in Ontario wrote &quot;Maggie&quot; to his lover,and if that isn't enough, the song &quot;I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen&quot; was written in America and had nothing at all to do with taking Kathleen back to Ireland,because she didn't come from there in the first place.However;all these songs are Irish .What you have to remember is that there over 50 million Irish dispersed all over the world including about 4 million in Ireland.This book would be a great gift for anyone with a song in their heart and a twinkle in their eye for there's sure to be some Irish in their blood."},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"Malachy McCourt's latest tome deserves recognition as one of the finest books written by himself or his brother Frank. It is an intriguing, occasionally fascinating, popular history on the origins and subsequent popularity of the Irish ballad &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. However, much of it could have easily been condensed into a terse article for one of the popular Irish-American journals or magazines such as the Irish Echo. Yet I must commend Malachy for adhering to a terse, journalistic prose which lacks the flamboyance and literary awkwardness shown in his bestselling &quot;A Monk Swimming&quot;. Devout fans of Irish music may find this an essential book to buy, but I suspect most will regard this as enjoyable light reading suitable only for Saint Patrick's Day."},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"This is NOT a little book that tells the story of the song---its history, composer, etc.---as one might expect, but a cheesy miniature book whose text is simply the lyrics of the song.

It only has 100+ pages due to the double spacing and large type. Save your money for a better effort."},{"Title":"Danny Boy: The Legend Of The Beloved Irish Ballad","review":"This is an entertaining, albeit very brief essay on the 155-word ballad this writing documents. Mr. McCourt has an extremely engaging wit that he has transferred to paper several times before. It is this talent and the commentary it provokes that makes this worth a reader's notice. There will be very few who will need much more than an hour to absorb the book, and were it not for the humor, which is primarily off the main topic of the song, this very brief volume would have never come to pass.\\"Some believe the only thing the Irish are serious about is saying goodbye\\", is a typical aside that leads to another anecdote by Mr. McCourt. He does give a brief background of the history of the music, and the almost 100 different sets of lyrics that have been set to it. The real surprise is for those that don't know who actually wrote the famous words. If the truth is as presented, I imagine it will set off a variety of hostilities. Before you read the book, take an informal poll, and note what country is associated with this song. I would hazard the results will be very consistent. Then you may pick up this book.How much value you place on bits of Irish humor will decide how you feel after reading this work. At 104 very small pages that are often partially filled with verse the reader must value a good laugh like a diamond.

At the exact moment I arrived at the line, \\"And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,\\" there was a thunderous stampede heard overhead: the school had just released its students for the day.Which has (or perhaps should have) almost nothing to do with this review, although that hilarious juxtaposition of lyrics and sound kept many eyes from misting up, which they normally would have given the powerful emotions often conjured by a performance of \\"Danny Boy,\\" something Malachay McCourt, in his lovely little book, mentions repeatedly.Who wrote the lyrics? Where did the Londonderry Air originate (alright, it came from Londonderry but from whose pen (or possibly, in this case, from whose pipes or whose fiddle)? Who is speaking/singing and what is her/his relationship to Danny?No spoilers here, and McCourt doesn't necessarily provide a concrete answer to all these questions, but he does lay out enough information, both legendary and factual, to make this a very informative read for lovers of the song. McCourt's writing is sometimes humorous, often beautiful, and always informative as can be seen from a summarizing paragraph towards the book's end:\\"While 'Danny Boy' will always be touted as an Irish ballad, it was truly the product of many different worlds meshing together. Let it be the tune of a blind, Irish fiddler drifting across the sea, reaching an English barrister who would finally marry words and melody to create a song capable of describing, at least in part, the contents of the human heart. The song depicts the human condition, about the unknown and the black cloud of finality that accompanies it. The message is available to all those who want to hear it.

Literally everything that you might want to know about pronghorns is here. And then some. For example, the chapter on hunting not only tells you how to clean a pronghorn but provides a few recipes (tastes like veal). The two lead authors are at the end of their careers and have collected two lifetimes of learning in this book.Reflecting all that knowledge, many of the chapters read like laundry lists of the scholarly literature. That makes it an essential reference but many chapters are a pretty dry read.The authors haven't done enough sifting through the material, weighing its strengths and weaknesses. We never get a manifesto for future research on, say, the parasitology or anatomy of the pronghorn. This would help liven up the book.This lack of synthesis or manifesto probably reflects the fact that O'Gara and/or Yoakum are the author or co-author of almost every chapter. Knowledgeable as they are, they can't be the leading experts on every single aspect of the pronghorn. The book would have been better served by a greater range of contributors. An excellent model of this, and a comparably exhaustive book that covers its animal better, is Mech and Boitano's \\"Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation.\\"The authors display their own voice most strongly in those chapters on in management issues: fencing and habitat fragmentation, capture and relocation, and hunting. The authors have strong views on how to do these things and how to do them right. These chapters are also the most lively written and the easiest to read.Even on those policy issues, O'Gara and Yoakum take the perspective of managers working within existing legal and political frameworks. From this bottom-up perspective, their best suggestions often rest on maintaining good relations among stakeholders such as hunters, landowners, and the public. It would be particularly valuable if these authors could step \\"outside the box\\" at the end and think about how they might change that regulatory environment in an ideal world. Do interspersed holdings of private land and BLM leases serve ranchers, hunters, and the animals best? Or would land swaps that consolidate private land and convert BLM land to wildlife refuges serve better? (Presumably the answer to that question depends on the share of public land in a state, since Wyoming and Nevada are not Nebraska or California.)These authors prefer to avoid bolder steps and claims. Again, this differs dramatically from the community of wolf researchers. Essential as this book is as a desk reference for those interested in this animal, it could have been better."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Dock (Agatha Christie Collection S.)","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Berkley edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead (HICKORY DICKORY DEATH) editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further differences still in the Signet, Bantam, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them.

Clearly, something is amiss. Miss Lemon, on questioning, reveals that she is worried about her sister, Mrs. Hubbard. After spending her married life in Singapore, Mrs. Hubbard has returned to England a widow, where she is living as matron of a youth hostel in Hickory Road, an establishment that caters to an international group of students. It seems that things, \\"odd things,\\" have been disappearing from the hostel, \\"And all in rather an unnatural way.\\" Miss Lemon suspects it's something more than petty thievery or kleptomania, and Poirot agrees to meet Felicity Lemon's distressed sibling.Although the story starts strongly with a colourful description of the students in the hostel, it deteriorates rather quickly into a complex micmac of red herrings. It seems as though Christie herself is not sure of the outcome when plotting her story. Of course, it is always fun to meet our dearest detective Hercule Poirot, but the amount of mischief going on in the hostel imposes some strain on the reader's patience as well on Poirot's ingenuity. Clearly one of the weakest novels to feature Poirot."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Dock (Agatha Christie Collection S.)","review":"revealing that she has a sister! Poirot had never before considered that his incredibly efficient secretary could be so human. Miss Lemon's sister was responsible for the errors as well, there were troubling things taking place in her life. There were thefts taking place at the youth hostel where she worked. Poirot decided to look into the matter as a favor to Miss Lemon and so he could restore the order in his own life.Poirot begins his investigation of the hostel and its residents but before he can solve the rash of petty thefts a murder occurs, a murder that is only the first of a series. The trail leads Poirot and the police into a world of smuggling with side trips through young love and family secrets.In typical Christie fashion the clues are all laid out for the reader to follow. There are red herrings to confuse the armchair detective - perhaps a few too many in this one - and of course, the usual Christie 'twist' at the end.It is often suggested that a writer should write about what they know and this book points out that Christie didn't know very much about unversity students in the mid-fifties. The characters do not come to life in this one they way they do in most of her other books. Keeping the various students/suspects sorted out it difficult because they really aren't very memorable. Also this one seems to suffer from too much - too much plot drug AND gem smuggling, too many red herrings and too many conincidences.It should be noted that this book was originally written in 1955 and certain parts are very much representative of that time. Stereotypes of Italians, blacks, Indians, Cockneys etc are all present and tend to make the 21st century reader cringe.Even though this is not one of Christie's masterpieces it is still an excellent read, thoroughly challenging and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Dock (Agatha Christie Collection S.)","review":"Agatha Christie often drew upon nursery rhymes and children's stories to provide inspiration (and titles!) for her mysteries; these includeA Pocket Full of Rye,Five Little Pigs,One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, and this: Hickory Dickory Dock. In this case however, the famous nursery rhyme is entirely incidental to the plot; you won't find any significant clocks or mice here - the setting of the mystery is on Hickory Road, and Poirot recites the song on the very last page, and that's it. It's a rather tenuous link, though theITV adaptationmilked the title for all it was worth by adding a soundtrack that (rather ridiculously) involved a chorus of singers that stage-whispered: \\"Hickory Dickory! Hickory Dickory!\\" every time something suspenseful happened.But that's neither here nor there. Mr Poirot is astounded that his secretary Miss Lemon (described as hideous, unimaginative and so efficient that she was more machine than woman) has handed him a letter with several spelling mistakes in it. His bewilderment is compounded when Miss Lemon speaks of her sister Mrs Hubbard. Miss Lemon has a sister?! Once his surprise is under control, Poirot listens to what she has to say: that there is a spate of kleptomania going on in the boarding house that Mrs Hubbard helps run, and the thefts are getting more serious.It's hardly something to interest the superior mind of a detective like Poirot, but his appetite is whetted when he catches a glimpse of the list of stolen items. They range from a diamond ring to light-bulbs to a single shoe to a rucksack which was found shredded into pieces, along with a variety of other disparate objects. He agrees to investigate, and after convincing the temperamental landlady of his good intentions, Mr Poirot suggests presenting a lecture on crime to the young students that live at the hostel in an attempt to flush out the thief. A murder follows soon after...From here the mystery takes off, but I have to say at this point that \\"Hickory Dickory\\" is not one of Christie's best. In fact, it's one of her worst. Though the setting of a youth hostel and the relationships of the students therein is promising, the sheer amount of characters, plot-threads and red herrings that are packed into the novel become too much to keep track of. There are eleven students living at the hostel, many of whom are indistinguishable from each other, and several which are utterly superfluous (and modern readers will no doubt wince at the stereotypical portrayal of the ethnic minorities). Add the four staff members on top of that, and you have a dizzying array of characters in such a slender book.Plot-wise, it feels like Christie is simply making it up as she goes along, especially when the final solution seems so disconnected from the initial premise, and there's an odd last-minute reveal of a mother/daughter relationship that means nothing and sheds no light on either character. Poirot is certainly at the top of his game when it comes to handling this case, though that's not necessarily a good thing considering he's almost clairvoyant in his deductions whilst at the same time not being as proactive as he usually is in his attempts to catch the killer.Though it's an interesting premise, and nice to get a look at the personal life of a minor character that lives in Poirot's orbit, \\"Hickory Dickory\\" is a bit of a dud. I'd recommend it for Christie completists only."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Dock (Agatha Christie Collection S.)","review":"Agatha Christie (1890-1976) liked to use nursery rhymes as titles for her mystery novels. She does so in \\"Hickory Dickory, Dock\\" a Hercule Poirot novel first published in 1955.The Plot: Miss Lemon, the picky secretary of Poirot, makes three mistakes while typing for her master. She is upset because her sister Mrs. Hubbard reports thefts occurring at the youth hostel where she is employed. Poirot investigates the thefts. A young lady named Celia Austin confesses to the crimes but is soon found dead. It is thought she committed suicide but Poirot believes it was murder most foul. She died with a drug taken from St.Catherine's Hospital where Celia was employed. There is a large cast of suspects consisting of the persons who live at the hostel. One of the most prominent is Nigel Chapman who reports Celia as being a kleptomaniac. Strange clues such as electric lights which were turned off on the premises, fake British passports and green ink spilled on a letter are important in the solving of the complex case. There are three murders in the short 217 page novel!The book has several faults:a. There are too many characters to keep track of in this short book.b. The characters personalities do not register in the reader's mind. They are chess pieces moved across the mystery board by Christie.c. Poirot's abilities are not challenged as in his great cases.

Poirot decides he must solve Mrs. Hubbard's problem so Miss Lemon can be her super-efficient self once more.Mrs. Hubbard, a widow who had previously been living in Singapore, manages a youth hostel at 26 Hickory Road.

Dame Christie's &quot;gift for deception&quot; is evident in this suspenseful who-dunit."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Dock (Agatha Christie Collection S.)","review":"When Hercule Poirot found his life a bit boring he often gave way to taking on a more frivolous case... but such diminutive problems in crime regularly expanded into morasses of deceit and murder. Poirot's secretary, Miss Lemon, has a sister (Mrs. Hubbard) who manages an international hostel where numerous small personal items of the youthful residents have gone missing. Some have subsequently been found vandalized.Since the hostel's Greek owner, prickly old Mrs. Nicoletis, desires that her boarding house maintain its good name, Mrs. Hubbard bypasses the police and, through her very efficient sister, interests Poirot in the case of the pilfered and damaged items. The esteemed private detective at once senses something very dark behind these deceptively innocuous petty thefts and after spending a pleasant evening with these mostly amiable college students and local workers, his firm advice is to call in the police without delay.Poirot's counsel is taken all too lightly as a mouse of a girl is presently slain in her room at the hostel. Inspector Sharpe works hand in glove with Poirot to solve this odious murder along with subsequent other high crimes.What primarily established the typical Agatha Christie yarn as a hallmark of the British mystery was the remarkable depth of her respective whodunits -- they are, for the most part, multi-dimensional in scope. One can add to that essential fact that her characters are colorful, her atmospheres are both cozy and palatable, and the intriguing cases of her various detectives are typically plausible, albeit often improbable. All these captivating nuances are firmly in place in this particular instance.This story is a classic example of how Christie apparently loved to tenon her murder cases with episodes of international intrigue. Of course her most famous of such works were those stories which involved the renowned husband and wife team of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, ergo:N or M? (Tommy and Tuppence).And Christie often ditched the cozy murder scheme altogether to focus specifically upon the spy thriller as she did inPassenger to Frankfort.Even Miss Marple stuck her itchy old nose into an internationally syndicated crime ring from time to time:At Bertram's Hotel: A Miss Marple Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection).But it seems to me that the mystery under review is sprinkled with just the right amount of the conspiracy component. It's still a cozy murder but one with broader implications. And that is about as far as I can go without unearthing a spoiler.In summary, the quality of this latter-period (1955) Christie mystery easily falls into the top twenty percent of her eighty or so mysteries and whodunit plays. This work is marketed under the \\"Nursery Rhyme Murder\\" series title of \\"Hickory Dickory Dock\\" but it's also sold asHickory Dickory Death (Red Badge Detective Mystery). I can highly recommend this terrific story to any fan of the Golden-age British mystery."},{"Title":"Hickory Dickory Dock (Agatha Christie Collection S.)","review":"Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is known for his 'gray cells', his ability to deduce the solution to the most puzzling of crimes. In \\"Hickory Dickory Dock\\" his gray cells are at work trying to solve the riddle of theft and eventually murder at a youth hostel. At first, Poirot can see little connection between the stolen objects, until he understands their order of disappearance and the broader scheme behind it all.Poirot is alerted to the strange happenings in Hickory Road by his secretary Miss Lemon, whose sister, Mrs. Hubbard, serves as the overseer of the hostel. Not wishing to call in the police and hoping that matters will right themselves naturally, Mrs. Hubbard allows Poirot to investigate the matter. After giving a talk to the students, one young girl confesses to the thefts, but not to all items that were stolen. When she is found dead a few days later, an apparent suicide, Mrs. Hubbard knows that murder has taken place. In the close confines of a youth hostel where the walls are paper thin and the locks are all the same, someone must know something and a murderer is certainly at large within the house.\\"Hickory Dickory Dock\\" is a fast-paced read, an enigma of a mystery that unravels over the course of the entire novel. Indeed, only Hercule Poirot would notice the links between certain clues while the reader is left clueless.

I have made some modifications on the original codes (ART1 and Fuzzy-ART) to run input vectors with unlimited dimensions, which proved its value when tested with a lot of data (in fact, I am using the codes for my IT Master thesis)."},{"Title":"The Natural Horse: Foundations for Natural Horsemanship","review":"The old adage goes &quot;No hoof, no horse,&quot; but you don't know what that means until you read this book. Jackson has done the (unfortunately) radical thing of asking Nature how a natural horse is made, and made to be happy and healthy. What he found through looking at horses in the wild -- exhaustively, scientifically, and compassionately -- should do nothing less than change the way we treat our horses: it defines our responsibilities as caretakers, the all-important issue of natural hoofs that permit natural movement, and the way to understand an animal with whom a partnership leads to happiness all round -- and with whom a dominance-based, consumerist approach leads to tragedy. Oddly, for a book that is based on fact, diagram, observation, measurement, description -- the result is at times as emotionally moving as the most genuine work of art. If you care about horses, you must read this book."},{"Title":"The Natural Horse: Foundations for Natural Horsemanship","review":"Jamie definately shows us a refreshing look at the natural horse thru the horses eyes. Readers will come away from this book with a new understanding of why horses do what they do and why humans have errored in the past. Take a real look at what we thought a hoof should look like and now see &quot; the natural hoof&quot; and it's advantages. Getting back to the basics will shatter modern beliefs about horse care. This information has been slow coming and will take generations to take hold, and it will!"},{"Title":"The Natural Horse: Foundations for Natural Horsemanship","review":"This book is fundamental, in multiple ways. The main topic described and discussed is the horse's hooves. Anyone who knows horses understands that hoof care is truly fundamental to the soundness of the horse. This is the best explanation I have ever seen of how nature intended horse hooves to function, and how our removal of horses from their natural environment impacts their hooves, thus their ability to move as nature meant them to. The author's deep and broad knowledge of horses is especially to be appreciaed. In addition to opening our minds to a greater understanding of their natural locomotion, he also explains clearly many other apsect of horse behavior in the wild, and how their needs change as we put them in unnatural situations and make unnatural demands on them. Anyone responsible for a horse's care, rider or not, should be required to read this book. Anyone who just loves these magnificent beasts will appreciate them all the more for the enhanced understanding of them this book makes possible. If you are thinking of acquiring a horse, make this the first book you read."},{"Title":"The Natural Horse: Foundations for Natural Horsemanship","review":"The Mustangs of the olde and now west , I came acroos my first herd of wild Mustangs in 1970 in New Mexico , my two young sons Simon and Paul,looked with great amazement at the bold magnificent creatures untouch by man, not molested , standing in natural beauty.

I feel greatfull that Jaime Jackson has studied the wild horses to learn from them, and that he has given us his knowledge in his books, so we have the chance to change our ways.

When Kelsey Cunningham takes a vacation from her busy job in Miami, she agrees to spend the week at the Florida Keys duplex of old chum Sheila Warren. But Sheila is missing, and none of Kelsey's old friends seem concerned, as Sheila is somewhat of a free spirit. And Kelsey must, once again, confront Dane Whitelaw, an old flame and the last person to see Sheila alive.As Kelsey and Dane attempt to discover Sheila's whereabouts, each is unwilling to trust the other, and Dane appears even more evasive, because his secrets would have disastrous effects if they became known. Their attraction becomes more volatile, and they are unwilling partners as their search for a possible serial killer leads them to Miami's strip clubs and the home of Sheila's sleazy stepfather.The cast of supporting characters adds depth to the read as it increases the number of suspects implicated in Sheila's disappearance. There is Cindy, the enterprising fitness dynamo who owns a t-shirt business. Nate, Kelsey's ex, runs a local bar, and admits to having once had a relationship with Sheila. Larry, Sheila's ex, never really got over the divorce. Izzy may be Sheila's supplier, but no one knows for sure. And Jorge makes mysterious boat runs as he dumps cargo overboard.The suspense is superb: it builds slowly and begins to spin out of control as the killer gets frightened that someone is getting too close to the truth. Readers won't be disappointed when this page-turning read packs one wallop of a conclusion."},{"Title":"Hurricane Bay","review":"Kelsey didn't have two brain cells to rub together evidenced by the fact that she intentionally involved herself in dangerous situations. She also acted like she was above everyone else and refused to believe that a friend she'd had little contact with for years could have \\"changed\\". There was virtually no character development and the romance was not at all convincing. What was the whole story behind St. Augustine and what happened between Kelsey and Dane after her brother's death? There were also pages of useless dialogue, who cares about an involved discussion of where to go to dinner. Again, boring!!"},{"Title":"Hurricane Bay","review":"As a longtime Heather Graham fan, I eagerly awaited the release of this book. I should have saved my money. The plot was trite, the characters were cardboard, the dialogue was poorly written, but worst of all, Sheila's murderer practically had a neon sign on his head pointing to him. The characters were basically unlikable, particularly the heroine, Kelsey.There was no compelling reason for her to believe Sheila hadn't just skipped town with her latest boy toy, but instead, she blows in from Miami and questions and suspects everyone in town, including her supposed best friends even after they tell her how Sheila has changed. The name Sheila also bothered me--anyone remember a murder mystery movie from the 70's \\"The Last of Sheila\\"? That's all I could think of while I waded through this mess. Throw in a serial killer, a copy cat killer (and oh yes, they all know one another)a PI with a tragic secret who slept with the murder victim and has a past with the heroine, who knows he's being set up to take the fall but stupidly doesn't confide in anyone and you can't believe you're reading a Heather Graham book. Skip this one entirely or borrow it from a friend, but save your money."},{"Title":"Hurricane Bay","review":"I became a fan of Heather Graham after reading \\"Picture Me Dead\\" and have been ordering/reading her other books. Just finished \\"Hurricane Bay\\" and have to say I was disappointed. There is no sexual chemistry between Dane and Kelsey, as there was in PMD.

I hope this one was a fluke."},{"Title":"Hurricane Bay","review":"I've read two of Heather Graham's books so far, and this will be my last.

It was very refreshing to read things that people really say in &quot;real life&quot; rather than editing the talking.

The plot may be a little sticky and unbelievable, but the characters and their entwined relationships are wonderful. I loved the small-town feeling and the just-returned-home, meet-the-old-gang scene. I thought the story itself could have been a little fuller and the motives a little more in-depth, but the exchanges between the characters make this fun read a lovely experience."},{"Title":"Hurricane Bay","review":"In Key Largo, Kelsey Cunningham confronts Dane Whitelaw as to the whereabouts of his former lover Sheila Warren missing a week and last seen with him. Dane insists he knows nothing, but Kelsey believes he is lying. She is right as Dane struggles with the photo left under his door that showed a dead Sheila on his property.Dane tries to persuade Kelsey to stay out, but she refuses and continues to make inquires as to the last of Sheila. However, someone reacts to her investigation by trying to shut her up. As the danger mounts for Kelsey, Dane attempts to learn who is setting him up to take the fall and how to keep the younger sister of a friend safe. Even as she wonders if Dane killed Sheila, Kelsey turns to him as the man she has always loved to protect her and to assist him with learning the truth.HURRICANE BAY is a strong investigative tale loaded with danger, romance, and deep characterizations. The story line contains romantic elements, but the tale belongs to the action and tension of the investigation. Kelsey is an intrepid heroine refusing to quit though she places her life in danger. Dane is the strong silent type who knows he must find out who is setting him up while keeping his beloved safe. Though why Kelsey would place herself in peril as she does (even Dane questions that) seems a stretch even for the deepest of friendships, fans will relish Heather Graham's strong stormy tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hurricane Bay","review":"I found this book really disappointing, it never really worked for me. Sure, it's got some nice description of the Keys and the minor characters and their bickering are lively and sometimes amusing but that doesn't redeem this novel.

But at least in this book we didn't have characters &quot;flexing their fingers&quot; on every page as well.The plot is thin, the murderer transparent, and the book a total waste of time.

Well, that was not the case here. The heroine was too abrasive, and the hero was a little thick. I've never understood people who would rather let people believe the worst of them, rather than tell the truth.There was simply no reason why the heroine immediately assumed the worst had happened to her friend, especially since she had said that the girl had frequently forgotten plans they had made. Just because she had taken time off from work, was no reason to assume the friend who remember their plans, if she has never done so in the past.And as for Dane, just because he was sent a picture of the dead girl on his beach, was no reason not to go to the police, rather than play detective himself.

As a whole the book exmaines from different angles and points of view the very compelling issues of what is going on with these phenomena and how we can perhaps best approach studying it. Almost all of the chapters are authored by researchers who demonstrate a great deal of knowledge of and insight into the aspect of UFO-logy they discuss.I would recommend this book only to open-minded readers who have a rather dispassionate interest in the topic. I say this because as one of the chapters I discuss below depicts so well, most people are more concerned with the myth of UFO's rather than the real evidence. I also want to say that the Kirkus review at the top of this page is only too typical of those who want evidence when such &quot;evidence&quot; would never satisfy their preconceived version of reality. Prof. Jacob's compilation to me presents more than enough proof that this issue is real and needs to be seriously addressed by mainstream disciplines.I will discuss four of the best chapters in &quot;UFO's And Abductions.&quot;One chapter in what to me was a rather ironic argument style shows how among science, law, and military intelligence, science is the *least* qualified to investigate UFO's because the data does not fit into any scientific model, and scientists cannot operate w/o such. Because war and defense necessitate avoiding preconceptions and simply examining the facts dispassionately, military intelligence is best qualified in the author's opinion. In my opinion the author did not go far enough, as I find the evidence that the military got technology from the ET's and gave it to industry very believable (Col. Corso's &quot;The Day After Roswell&quot;, also &quot;The Montauk Project&quot; books).Budd Hopkins' contribution is a thorough rebuttal to the skeptics'strongly biased attempts to dismiss all abduction accounts as phony. The most salient point he brings out is that many abductees have very clear memories w/o undergoing any hypnosis. He also gives plenty of evidence that hypnosis of abductees does not produce the kind of false memories claimed by debunkers, such as the false memories &quot;remembered&quot; by &quot;victims&quot; of parental abuse.Psychiatrist John Mack insightfully probes how the abduction phenomenon expands our concepts of reality, particularly the merging of the spirit and material worlds, which are kept separate by the current materialistic worldview. Dr. Mack also feels that the transformations that occur in the lives of abductees are genuine and significant. Of course Dr. Mack is very familiar from personal experience with how the mainstream disciplines react when a researcher attempts to provide evidence that threatens the current belief systems!The longest and to me the best chapter in this book is called &quot;Lost In The Myths,&quot; which is for the most part a brilliant discussion of first the many values of myths, and then how relevant it is to view the UFO phenomenon from the standpoint of these myths. For example, as we know from Joseph Campbell, story myths can be used to resolve some of the bizarre contradictions in life, so that the resolution is assimilated into the unconscious. UFO's in this context unite technology with magic, advanced science with angelic archetypes who will save a world on the brink of apocalypse (it always is, isn't it?!). The author also compares the transformations experienced by UFO abductees with those who have undergone shamanic initiations. Finally, the author rightly calls on science and the public to separate the myths of UFO's from their actuality, to study the evidence w/o the biases."},{"Title":"UFOs & Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge","review":"This book offers a compendium of theses which decently portrays the UFO and alien abduction phenomena.1) UFOLOGY AND ACADEMIA: THE UFO PHENOMENON AS A SCHOLARLY DISCIPLINE argues for the inclusion of the UFO mystery into the mainstream academia, which should be studying such things, but instead chooses to distance itself from the phenomenon. The debate has been relegated to the tabloid fringe, and respectable science won't go near it. This will need to change if we are ever to get to the bottom of it all.2) LIMITED ACCESS: SIX NATURAL SCIENTISTS AND THE UFO PHENOMENON is a good primer on six important early ufologists, who laid the groundwork of how to study the phenomenon while government maintained its official position of denial. Some of these men worked for the government as public debunkers, while privately realizing that there is definitely something going on which offers no easy explanations.3) SCIENCE, LAW, AND WAR: ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORKS FOR THE UFO EVIDENCE debates which segment of society is most adept at studying the UFO phenomenon. Ultimately, science cannot move forward without tangible proof, which has proven elusive. Science requires data, not eyewitness testimony. The military offers the preferred framework from which to attack the mystery. After all, the objects appear in our skies, seemingly oblivious to our need for an explanation for them. The military must determine if there is a direct or indirect threat to the people it has enlisted to protect, while cloistering itself from public scrutiny.4) UFO'S, THE MILITARY, AND THE EARLY COLD WAR ERA is a fantastic history of the public and militaristic mindsets of our country beginning with the mystery of the WWII foo fighters and into the Project Blue Book era. It is not surprising that the mysterious objects were first considered to be of Nazi design, and later, of Soviet design using captured Nazi technology. The concept that they were possibly of extraterrestrial origin came later. If the Soviets were showcasing high technology as psychological warfare, then the proper US response was to offer explanations that the objects were either hitherto unknown natural phenomena, or simply weren't there at all. Sounds familiar.5) THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL HYPOTHESIS IN THE EARLY UFO AGE tells that when Gallup took a poll shortly after the war to gauge the public's opinion on the \\"flying saucer\\" phenomenon, it was discovered that most Americans considered only three options for the objects: Soviet design, American design, or hoax. The saucers as machinery of extraterrestrial origin was not even considered. Our government could exclude the American design option, and was left with Soviet or ET design. If they were of Soviet design, then we were facing an empire which was so technologically advanced that it is surprising they didn't whoop us.6) UFO'S: LOST IN THE MYTHS offers evidence throughout the history of mankind for some sort of archetypical relationship between men and creatures of the spirit world. Whether speaking of gods, angels, devils, incubi, witches, or fairies, men of history have described entities outside of our reality which nonetheless are capable of interfering with our business. Are the Grays the latest manifestation?7) THE UFO ABDUCTION CONTROVERSY IN THE UNITED STATES is written by David Jacobs. For decades, UFO's were strictly an eyewitness phenomenon. All the data was based on sightings and occasional landing traces, but any accounts of entities were dismissed outright. This changed in the mid-60's when the first accounts of abduction went public. Ufology was split, as the sightings experts distanced themselves from this new implausibility. Jacobs is convinced that the abductions are the main reason that the UFO's are in our skies. The reason for the abductions involves the use of human reproductive facilities to create transgenic beings of alien design. It sounds silly, but there is plenty of data to back up this claim.8) HYPNOSIS AND THE INVESTIGATION OF UFO ABDUCTION ACCOUNTS is Budd Hopkins' refutation of the main knock against his investigative technique: the tendency toward confabulation between the interviewer and the subject during hypnosis. Everything Hopkins writes is genius and this is no exception.9) HOW THE ALIEN ABDUCTION PHENOMENON CHALLENGES THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR REALITY is John Mack putting his Harvard brain to good use by intellectualizing the abduction phenomenon much more than the pragmatists Hopkins and Jacobs. Mack senses that we should not be trying to force the \\"aliens\\" into our preconceived notion of reality, but should recognize the existence of the aliens as proof that our notion of reality is incomplete.10) THE UFO EXPERIENCE: A NORMAL CORRELATE OF HUMAN BRAIN FUNCTION presents medical data showing how easy it is to reproduce the \\"entity perception\\" by electrically stimulating certain areas of the brain. Electrical interference patterns can be \\"programmed\\" and sent through the skull, directly into the brain, which can dissociate the two lobes of the brain to a degree that the person will actually project into reality a second self. Side effects of this brain stimulation include the sensation of floating and odd smells, amongst other things that are par for the course in abduction reports."},{"Title":"UFOs & Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge","review":"I read this book edited by David Jacobs, Ph.D. expecting good information on the UFO abductions phenomenon from different points of view.

Science, Law and War: Alternative Frameworks for the UFO Evidence, by Don Donderi, Professor of Psychology at McGill University, Montreal - argues that of all professional disciplines, science is the least appropriate to studying the phenomenon and that military intelligence, due to its methodologies and modus operandi, the most appropriate4. UFOs, the Military and the Early Cold War Era, by Michael D. Swords, Professor of Natural Science at Western Michigan University - in which the author analyses the military's response to the phenomenon in modern times and how this is governed by national security issues5. The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis in the Early UFO Age, by Jerome Clark - in which the author examines how unpopular was the ETH in the early years of the modern phenomenon after WW2 and how a possible Soviet origin seemed more plausible at the time6. UFOs: Lost in the Myths, by Thomas Bullard - the author is a folklore specialist and here condenses his thesis about the gray aliens being the latest manifestation of a recurrent societal myth throughout human history (important to stress he sees the core phenomenon as real, not imaginary)7. The UFO Abduction Controversy in the USA, by the editor, Professor David Jacobs - paraphrasing the title of his 1975 doctoral thesis \\"The UFO Controversy in America\\", the author argues convincingly that the abduction of humans and a hybridization-breeding program is the main reason why UFOs are so ubiquitous in our skies. Despite the seeming improbability of such a claim to those unfamiliar with the data, the author produces plenty of evidence in support of his contention8. Hypnosis and the Investigation of UFO Abduction Accounts, by Budd Hopkins - in which the author, one of the best investigators in the field and a first-class writer to boot - very effectively demolishes brick-by-brick the unfounded criticisms of regressive hypnosis as a tool to aid memory recovery9. How the Alien Abduction Phenomenon Challenges the Boundaries of our Reality, by John E. Mack, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard University Medical School - who argues (as in his final book on the subject \\"Passport to the Cosmos\\") that we need to expand our concept of what constitutes reality in order to understand the abduction phenomenon, rather than try to force-fit it into our current paradigms10. The UFO Experience: a normal Correlate of Human Brain Function, by Michael A. Persinger, Professor of Psychology and Neuro-science at Laurentan University in Ontario - in which the author presents data to demonstrate that several reported characteristics of abductions may be induced in a laboratory by stimulating areas of the brain, including the perception of alien entities (one is reminded of Graham Hancock's theories about the power of hallucinogenic agents like Ayahuasca to achieve the same result)In the concluding chapter 11 Professor Jacobs writes in summary:\\"...virtually all participants agree that the intellectual community has inadequately confronted this phenomenon, not because of the paucity of evidence but because of entrenched political and cultural bias. Rarely has a logical viewpoint towards a legitimate topic of scholarship been greeted with such steadfast opposition. In the 1960s, Allen Hynek liked to characterize the Air Force's stance toward the existence of UFOs as \\"It can't be, therefore it isn't\\". Hynek could have easily expanded his characterization to include nearly the entire scholarly community...\\"The societal reaction to the phenomenon has been very different than would be indicated by its persistence as a cultural artefact. Rather than society fashioning UFOs and abductions into new directions as the culture evolves over the years, the phenomenon...remains stubbornly what it is. As such, it appears to have an internal integrity devoid of cultural determinants.\\"The volume contains a very extensive bibliography and notes section, but no photos or illustrations. Writing and editing overall is at least good from all the contributors, and from some truly excellent.It is to Professor Jacobs' credit that he invited essay contributions form academics with whom he personally has fundamental differences of opinion about the subject: the point is not to push one particular line, but to present educated, thoughtful but differing perspectives in the same volume. Overall the book is not just excellent, but one of the very best ever published on the UFO and abduction subject. If it's not in your library, it should be."},{"Title":"Panther: And Other Stories of Great Hunting Retrievers: Original Stories About the Special Bonds Between Man and Dog","review":"I've hunted with Labrador retrievers for nearly 30 years, and can attest to the \\"special bonds\\" that exist between a hunting dog and the two-legged hunter, something that the average dog owner will never experience, no matter how much they love their pet. Only the hunter will ever experience the incredible feats, heart, and emotions that a good hunting dog is capable of. Retrievers in particular are capable of showing you exactly what they think; miss an easy shot on a bird, and they will look over their shoulder at you as if to say, \\"I'm out here doing my job and you miss THAT shot? Maybe you should give that shotgun to me!\\"\\"Panther\\" is a book hunters will enjoy. The non-hunter can appreciate these special dogs, but not to the same degree. It is not a book you will sit down and read cover to cover, but one you'll pick up on a cold winter's night to read one story at a time. Normally I avoid most \\"me and my dog\\" stories, since I have enough \\"me and my dog\\" stories to write my own book. I also dislike overdone sentimentality and the wailing and gnashing of teeth when a good dog passes on, since over 30 years I've had to deal with that heart-wrenching inevitability many times. I don't care to read someone else's eulogy to \\"old Shep.\\" Been there and done that myself, and have shed my own tears over my own dogs. That's enough.Fortunately, \\"Panther\\" in general avoids excessive sentimentality and simply relates the stories of some exceptional dogs. It is not high literature, it does not set out to \\"prove\\" anything or make any points. It simply tells some good stories about real dogs. Any hunter who has had that \\"special\\" dog once in their lifetime will understand. It reaffirms why an addiction to hunting retrievers is more expensive, at times more frustrating and more difficult to break than a heroin habit...and why people like me can't live without them."},{"Title":"Panther: And Other Stories of Great Hunting Retrievers: Original Stories About the Special Bonds Between Man and Dog","review":"My wife gave me this book for my birthday and I was bowled over. The title story made me laugh, cry--and that was only the beginning. The comparison to Seabiscuit is apt. Panther is the definition of an underdog. What a great heart. The other stories, too, were wonderful. I loved John Madson's tale about the Lab Bess, who fetched mallards between giving birth to a whole litter of puppies. And the story of the boy who saved an old duck dog who had fallen through the ice, returning an earlier favor. Ted Lundrigan's story &quot;Trust in Black&quot; was so good it made me look up his other books on Amazon. What a brilliant writer. I don't think I've ever read a more poignant, heart-felt confession about a man's love for retrievers, or any other breeds or individual dogs.Buy this book for yourself or someone else. It will be one of the best presents you'll ever give or get!"},{"Title":"Panther: And Other Stories of Great Hunting Retrievers: Original Stories About the Special Bonds Between Man and Dog","review":"We've got Triever Fever, and our Yellow Lab is 3 years old now.

It will pull at your heartstrings like no others can, and if you are owned by a Lab or know someone who is, it's a great gift as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Northern Exposure Cookbook: A Community Cookbook from the Heart of the Alaskan Riviera","review":"I gave this cookbook to someone as a gift.

When I saw this cookbook I had to get it. The cookbook is written as if the town were doing a fundraiser for a statue dedicated to Roslyn and Cicely. The recipes are those that are mentioned in various episodes, and there is a guide to the episodes in the back of the book. There are black and white photos through the book from episodes, and an introduction to the recipes by both Ruth-Anne and the character that provided the recipe. The recipes are very wide ranging, from pancakes and omelettes to bagels and Adam's homemade pumpkin tortellini. I have tried these recipes:Griddle Cakes - Probably the best pancakes that I have ever madeThe Brick's Kick-Ass ChiliThe Brick's Spaghetti and MeatballsRruth-Anne's Pot RoastAdam's Cumin NoodlesMaggie's Bran MuffinsBanana Bread a la Maggie - This is the best banana bread that I have had, much different than the usual heavy textureRuth-Anne's Chewy Oatmeal CookiesTaco SaladThis book can definately expand your cooking horizons, and let you have fun doing so. Who wouldn't want Adam verbally abusing you while showing you how to cook?"},{"Title":"The Northern Exposure Cookbook: A Community Cookbook from the Heart of the Alaskan Riviera","review":"I must admit that I bought this book because of its association with Northern Exposure. That isn't to say that I don't love cookbooks, because I do...but I wasn't expecting too much in the way of good recipes.However, it has many down-home recipes that are easy to make and comforting. Plus, the occasional odd recipe that is nearly as odd as some of the folks from the show. I just wish that it had contained even more text tied to specific episodes of the show and events in the town. It had a fair bit, but more would have been nice. Perhaps, some pithy commentary by Chris here and there and some mythology or history related by Marilyn? They could have made the book look like it had actually been put together by the town...such as happens in real life.My only real complaint is that pictures would have been a huge plus. Not just of the characters, but of the town and, most of all, of the FOOD. Perhaps, that's a bias of mine, but I enjoy cookbooks with lots of pics of the food. Though, I do understand that it then raises the cost of the book.Fun book overall. Great gift for someone who enjoyed the show, plus who likes to cook."},{"Title":"The Northern Exposure Cookbook: A Community Cookbook from the Heart of the Alaskan Riviera","review":"A fun read and good recipes too.

To my astonishment he took up cooking for the first time in his life, and I think he eventually made every recipe in the book. When I recently found out that this show was a favorite of a good friend of mine, and that he had the entire series on DVD, I bought the cookbook for him for Christmas.

The cookbook is VERY well done. The commentary from different characters made me laugh because it was spot on. The recipes were for things that actually were mentioned or shown in the episodes and I love that. And, at the back of the book they actually reference which season/episode each recipe relates to. I've made a couple of the recipes and they were both delicious. I treasure this cookbook almost as much as the dvds..almost. lol."},{"Title":"The Northern Exposure Cookbook: A Community Cookbook from the Heart of the Alaskan Riviera","review":"This book is presented as if the reader is a resident of Cicely purchasing a cook book for a community fund-raiser.

A must for all true fans!"},{"Title":"The Northern Exposure Cookbook: A Community Cookbook from the Heart of the Alaskan Riviera","review":"Not only is this book a real hoot for Northern Exposure fans, it's the only cookbook I've bought in years in which no recipe has failed (yet). Every one I've tried so far has turned out just great on the first try. Experienced cooks know just how rare that is. Ruth-Anne's Meat Loaf (dried bread crumbs are fine) and The Brick's Spaghetti and Meatballs (by all means make the meatballs, but I sometimes cheat and used canned sauce) are now part of my standard repertoire, and the recipes are frequently requested by guests.

All the recipes you heard mentioned from Adam and the zabaglione he whipped up for Eve on their first date to the Cassoulet Chris had at the monastery.

The index is great because you can look up recipes by the character, or by the name of the recipe. And it even has a section for Thanksgiving, and a section for Christmas. Each recipe reminds me of the episode that it originated from, and it feels like I have a little piece of Cicely in my own home.

It's a pretty good book, but with a few shortcomings...Chapter list: An Attack on the Telephone Network; An Attack on an ISP; If He Had Just Paid the Rent; Inside a Hacker Sting Operation...; Identity Theft; Let's Ask the Hackers; Why Do Hackers Hack?; Setting the Stage; High-Tech Crime; What Not to Do; How to Run a High-Tech Case; What Have We Learned; Appendix; Bibliography; IndexThere are two types of writing in this book. Up through Inside A Hacker Sting Operation, the focus is on real-life cases that the author was part of. You learn details about how cyber-crime is conducted, uncovered, and prosecuted. The benefit here is that you see the warts and failings of the process instead of the glorified versions as told by security experts. After that chapter, there is less emphasis on stories and more focus on subjects, such as why these things occur and how to conduct an investigation. There are still references to real-life events, but that's less of an emphasis. Branigan's writing is humorous and lightly satirical, and makes for an enjoyable read.The shortcoming was something I couldn't quite put my finger on until I read the preface. Steve started this book in 1999 and thought he'd be done in early 2002. September 11th threw him off, and he didn't get started again until nearly a year later. So in effect, you have a book on cyber-crime published in 2004 that was largely written between 1999 and 2001. While there are references to events in the recent past, many of the significant stories and examples are vintage 2002 or earlier. In my opinion, it's the only significant flaw in what is otherwise an interesting read."},{"Title":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital Front","review":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed is a great book for management.The stories are real, written in non-technical language.Makes for very interesting reading."},{"Title":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital Front","review":"Prior to 'High-Tech Crimes Revealed' (HTCR) I read and reviewed 'Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent' (HTOAC). While HTOAC is fictional and written almost exclusively from the point of view of the 'hacker,' HTCR is mostly true and written from the law enforcement perspective. On the strength of the cases described in the first half of the book, I recommend HTCR as an introduction to the mindset needed to pursue and prosecute cyber criminals.Author Steve Branigan brings a unique perspective to his book. In 1986-7 Branigan was a patrolman in the Seaside Heights Police Department, but three years later he investigated telecom incidents for Bell Communications Research. Later work at Lucent and Bell Labs prepared him for co-founding Lumeta in 2000. His experience with telecom security differentiates the book from those who spend more time on Internet-centric crimes.I found the first half of the book more helpful than the second half, particularly when legal and criminal concepts are introduced in the context of security investigations. Ch 1 offers insight into drafting search warrants when pursuing a rogue insider. Ch 2 explains subpoenas and executing search warrants. Ch 3 discusses options at trial, like plea bargains. Ch 4 outlines an undercover sting and the role of confidential informants. Ch 5 talks about identity theft and ch 6 describes the author's role in interviewing two 'hackers.'The first half of the book uses true stories to make its points, but the second shifts more to opinions with short stories added for interest. I skimmed these later chapters as they seemed more appropriate for those without security and forensic experience.A few excerpts from the book are quote worthy. On p 106 Branigan notes that during a sting operation, the cops disabled exploit tools hosted on a cop-supervised bulletin board to avoid 'facilitating the transmission of hacking tools.' Consider that when you find a 'broken exploit.' A footnote on p 111 says 'NetStumbler is freeware. Why people write these things nobody knows.' NetStumbler isn't just for wardriving by those with malicious intent; sys admins also use it to discover rogue access points.I agree with Thomas Duff's assessment regarding the shelf life of Branigan's stories. Many cases, like ch 1's SS7 intrusion, were cool despite being almost 10 years old. In other places Branigan really dated himself. For example, p 118 states 'the main set of backdoor programs for UNIX are collectively known as rootkit, and those for Windows-based systems are Back Orifice and Netbus.' That was mostly correct in 2000, but very dated by 2004. I also question the 'session takeover' techniques mentioned on p 175; far too little detail is offered to make me accept this 'magic' capability.Overall I recommend reading HTCR. Branigan literally has a front-row seat on several fascinating security incidents. Few people have accompanied police when seizing evidence or performed hands-on analysis of live systems as related by HTCR. Readers with an interest in telco security will particularly enjoy Branigan's tales, and I appreciated his use of FreeBSD as a forensic platform."},{"Title":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital Front","review":"Few things really change in human society. As computers become more ubiquitous, the criminal elements of society find ways to use them for profit. There is also the teen vandal/joyrider element as well. Young people, traditionally males, have always embarked on \\"adventures\\" for thrills and to prove that they can do it. The difference when they use computers is that the consequences are orders of magnitude greater. Formerly, when a young person threw a rock through a window to be obnoxious, the damage was restricted to the window. Now, if a young hacker writes a particularly virulent computer virus, it can lead to worldwide costs in the billions.The legal systems of the world are struggling to keep up with the technological advancement. The definitions of some fundamental principles of law have had to be substantially modified so that certain actions can be considered a crime. Consider the definition of trespassing. Before computers were ubiquitous, it was the act of physically moving to locations declared off-limits. Now, it also includes the virtual entry into a computer system.In this book, case histories covering the range of computer \\"incidents\\" are covered. Some of them are the computer equivalent of a joyride, where a hacker penetrates a system just to prove that they can do it. Few alterations to the system were done, in many cases they left nothing more than the digital equivalent of a pile of mud in the hall to announce their presence. Other case histories deal with some of the more serious crimes, where money and credit card numbers, the digital equivalent of money, were stolen. I personally would have liked to read more detailed descriptions of these crimes. Of course, this is not necessarily the author's fault, as the victims of these crimes are very reluctant to release information on how the crime was perpetrated.The most interesting data in the book concerns the tactics that one must use in capturing the evidence needed to convict a hacker in a court of law. Since digital data is so easily altered, (forged), the rules of evidence gathering are very precise. The slightest misstep can render the evidence tainted at best and worthless at worst. The author has a great deal of experience in ferreting out computer criminals, and this book is in many ways a recapitulation of criminal behavior. To catch a criminal, you must think like a criminal. The strategies he used in virtual stakeouts are sound advice for anyone who suspects that their computer systems are under attack. This of course is nearly everyone, because if people can log onto your computer, you should consider it at risk.Computer crime is no different from traditional forms of crime such as robbery, assault, and criminal trespass. If it is allowed to go unchecked, the very fabric of society is at risk. In one way it is different, in that the consequences of what many might consider the act of simple irresponsibility can lead to significant monetary damages and even death. This book does not provide a lot of information about how to harden your defenses. However, in the area of how to identify an attack and track down the criminal(s), it is excellent."},{"Title":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital Front","review":"Author Steven Branigan is involved with many real incidents of high-tech crimes, and in High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories From The Digital Front provides details on how to find out what actually takes place in such crimes. From the specific abuses of computers and technology to the legal and social concerns often overlooked in cyber-crimes, Branigan's collection of real-world cyberwar stories is enlightening - and frightening, documenting a new frontier of the war against terrorism."},{"Title":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital Front","review":"I really enjoyed this book, first for it's technical content, as you would expect. Then second as a set of interesting stories about security. And it's these stories that bring security issues to life.This is not a reference book. The technical content is related directly to the stories and case studies. But the technical content is still very compelling, well written and in-depth.If you are looking for a book on how to secure Linux or NT, this is not your book. I think this book is written for people with a passion about security and who are serious about a career in information security. Those types of people will love this book."},{"Title":"High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the Digital Front","review":"The great cover art plus the title led me to believe that exciting stories were inside. The most exciting chapter is the one you can read for free on the author's webpage, from there it doesn't get much better.If you've been online for any time at all, you'll be familiar with better material. The charts and graphs in the latter part of the book don't give the reader enough information in most cases to determine the validity of the information or to make sense of it. I think some of the information was cherry-picked to go along with the flow of the chapters.The writer's style can be tedious to read in that the sentences are twisted and often run-on. For example, \\"How can we determine, before an attack, what it is most likely, that a hacker will attack?\\" After a few dozen sentences like that one, you'll start to laugh!I found Clifford Stoll's dated work, \\"The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage\\" a much more exciting read."},{"Title":"Marvel Age Avengers Earths Mightiest Heroes","review":"I've been out of the comic-scene for the last several months, so I'm not up to date on current trade paperback collections of previously released material. When I first saw this listing on Amazon.com, I thought \\"Neat, someone is releasing a MARVEL AGE DIGEST of mid-late seventies AVENGERS material. That's good stuff for the kiddies.\\"Information on the specific contents was sparse and no cover image was available, but upon seeing Gerry Conway and Jim Shooter's names listed as writers, along with Perez for the art, I thought that I was looking at something along the run of AVENGERS (volume 1) #150-156, which again would be a good run to release in trade paperback geared toward a younger audience.And so, sight unseen, I placed an order. The merchant selling the item was prompt and efficient, and I received my item within five days of placing the order. I have no complaints with the merchant selling the item. My only complaint, if I have one, is with Marvel trade paperback division and the editor of the collection.To wit: this trade paperback is an edited re-release of 1999's AVENGERS VISIONARIES: GEORGE PEREZ volume. The aforementioned AVENGERS VISIONARIES volume consisted of reprints of AVENGERS ANNUAL #6, AVENGERS #161-162, AVENGERS ANNUAL #8, AVENGERS #194-196 and a short back-up story featuring Jarvis the Butler from AVENGERS #201.The MARVEL AGE edited reprint collection eliminates AVENGERS #194-196, a well-regarded story introducing the villainous Taskmaster and guest-starring the Scott Lang version of Ant-Man.Amusingly, in the cast of characters given in the introductory pages of this collection, the Scott Lang Ant-Man is listed as one of the cast of characters, but the only stories he appeared in during the period covered by this collection, the aforementioned issues #194-196, have been removed from this volume.Additionally, the credits page at the beginning of this volume lists Joseph Rubinstein, Jack Abel and Dan Green as inker, and again, the issues that they had worked on - the aforementioned issues #194-196 - have been omitted from this volume. Consequently, the book contains an inaccurate credits page.While these may be picayune objections to the product, the element the causes me the most amused consternation is that the artwork for the reprints of issues #161, 162, and Annual 8 has been bowdlerized. The artwork - which had been previously approved by the Comics Code Authority when it was first published - has been prudishly altered from that printed in 1977 and 1978 (and in the 1999 AVENGERS VISIONARIES volume) apparently to \\"protect the children\\" from Janet Van Dyne Pym's unfortunate wardrobe choices.For example, in issue #161, Jan wore a purple backless number with a plunging neckline, a bare midriff and lots of little cutouts running down the outside of the legs. For this collection, the art has been altered and recolored to eliminate Jan's cleavage and cover up her midriff. [They even went so far as to erase her bellybutton.]In issue #162, back in 1977, a naked Jan was bound on a platform with metal restraints strategically covering the naughty bits in a situation reminiscent of what befell the Dahlia Lavi character in the late sixties Bond spoof CASINO ROYALE. This remained untouched in the 1999 reprint, but in 2004, the artwork has been altered to put Jan in a light grey bodystocking. This time, the art-retoucher neglected to eliminate her navel, and this suit sweats in little beads of perspiration just like Jan's bare skin did in 1977.In Avengers Annual #8 (ca. 1978), Jan wore a blue-green minidress with a plunging neckline. Again the artwork has been altered to remove Jan's cleavage, by having Jan wear an undershirt in a color identical to the minidress. Not content with saving the reader from Jan's cleavage, the powers-that-be in charge of this collection have decided that they must also save us from the prospect of Jan's bare legs. Oh dear, oh dear, she now has leggings in an identical blue-green color to the minidress and new undershirt.I read these stories when they first came out at the tender age of ten and eleven. My own children have read these stories in their original form at ages younger than I was upon their first release. It has been by experience that mores liberalize with the passage of time, so I find this rampant censoring of material that twenty-six and twenty-seven years ago WAS considered appropriate to all-ages (as the current MARVEL AGE line is touted as being) most curious.As a reader and longtime fan, I expected Marvel to be responsible with regard to their reprint product, but not cowardly. The alteration of the material reprinted in this collection smacks more of moral cowardice than artistic responsibility.So, my review is mixed. The stories I would give a four-star rating, but the exection of this edition I would give a mere two star rating, thus averaging out to the three stars I have given above.Buy if if you are interested in it or think you or someone you know would enjoy it, but be aware that the material has been noticably altered from how it was originally intended."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"Growing up during the manned space program of mid 1960's, I missed the fears and excitement of the Cold War and the initial space race.

It's about the times we lived in. It's about the revision and re-telling of history and dealing with the devil (von Braun) to get to where we collectively as a nation wanted to go, be it from a social, economic, political or military perspective.\\"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century\\" is a good, fun read. The author has managed to succeed where all too many authors of technical or scientifically based subjects fail.

When applied cleverly, that writing strategy leads to some great books. This is one of them.Dickson covers the history of rocketry and missiles, taking a look at the science and the scientists that led up to the launch of Sputnik. He captures the mood of the Cold War and gives you a sense of the rude awakening the United States experienced when the USSR beat it into space. Then the book ranges into the responses of the US and the USSR to Sputnik, covering the space race to its end on the moon.All of the material is carefully brought together and conveyed in such a way that you keep reading long after you needed to put the book down and do something else.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys history. This one is very well done."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"I vividly remember the Sputnik announcement when I was 6 years old. Gradually, I became part of the cohort of the concerned. By my seventh birthday, I worriedly discuss the possibility of a Soviet bomb hurtling down from a satellite to kill all Americans. My cousin, Mark (older and wiser), reassured me that bombs from satellites were not possible. On a piece of paper he drew a picture of an object falling from outer space. \\"They burn up before they hit the ground,\\" he explained. This seven year old's analysis was reassuring and I became less panicky. Later, of course, I learned that my cousin was wrong -- things could fall from space without burning up.Frankly, I am glad that I (and other Americans) didn't know the content of Dickson's work when Sputnik was beeping. The Sputnik \\"freak out\\" would have been far worse! Dickson demonstrates a history of lack of vision. It should come to no surprise that the US government and military were unable create a policy that would maintain technological advances. If the Soviets wanted to stifle our process toward outer space, they couldn't have done a better job than our governmental incompetence. If it weren't governmental meddling, I am sure we would have a colony on Mars now.The eerie aspect to understanding the historical circumstances of Sputnik involves two dimensions. First, I see a continuation of gross incompetent government leadership. Things haven't changed. We can't seem to construct a coherent immigration policy. Our military lacks an effective strategy to combat guerilla warfare (we call it \\"insurgency\\"). Our governmental leaders are only recently admitting that global warming might be a problem. It is Sputnik all over again. Second, one can quickly recognize our weak educational system. At the beginning of the space race, we used our brains and the slide rule. With the technological advances associated with micro chip, Dickson demonstrates that we have an increasing proportion of engineering disasters like bridge collapses. We seem to be witnessing an increase proportion of senility. Perhaps, we need to surrender our computers and return to the slide rule!Dickson is a crafty writer. Although Sputnik is well-documented piece of nonfiction (great footnotes), it reads like fiction. If one enjoys reading about history, technology or incompetent governmental officials, I highly recommend SPUTNIK."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"2007/10/25 a video based on this book is called Sputnik Mania and it is nominated for an award. awards night is 7 december 2007.thehoffmancollection. i think it is important for baby boomers to read because they may become curious as i did about the cold war, the world trade center and osama bin laden. through the artificial moons now circling the earth we are entertained.hopefully, we will not just amuse our selves to death.1957 sputnik.2007 plumpynut.we could not have had 2007 without the events of 1957."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"This is a terrific accounting of the event leading to the ramp up of the Space Race.

The crises that America faces today make the book remarkable timely. Dickson tells the exciting story of how Eisenhower steadfastly stood up to powerful domestic forces: hot-headed politicians, panic-stricken pundits, trigger-fingered military and \\"Strangelove\\" missile-men - all led by Nazi hero Wernher von Braun - who would have surely used their beloved V-2 rockets to move the world toward a buzz-bomb Armageddon.

I learned a lot about the times leading up to the launch, the flight itself, and the immediate aftermath.The main negative about the book that stands out in my mind is how people over stated the significance of Sputnik. I had always thought Sputnik caught the US and the rest of the world completely by surprise. Instead, the book relates as to how both the US and USSR had further rocket research and technology since WW II and that both countries had announced that they would launch satellites during the period of 1 July 1957 through 31 December 1958. The Soviets dropped hints left and right that they were about to launch a satellite and most people either chose to ignore them or did not believe them. After reading about that, the &quot;shock value&quot; of a tiny little satellite sending peeping sounds around the world was somewhat diminished.Sputnik did indeed have an impact upon the US and its society. But I am not certain that much of what transpired the following decades in space exploration would have been much different than if the US had, as Dr. Werner Von Braun had aspired, been the first to launch a satellite. A space race would have occurred regardless, in my opinion. After reading the book, I cannot subscribe to the thought that Sputnik radically altered the direction of space exploration. Both countries were heading in that direction already.The title itself was a little misleading, but perhaps necessarily so from a marketing standpoint. As the book addressed far more than just Sputnik, a more accurate title might have been something along the lines of &quot;The Race For Space&quot; or &quot;The Space Race - The Early Years&quot;. But such a title probably would not have been the attention grabber than a simple title like &quot;Sputnik&quot;."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"Paul Dickson has done a good job of telling a great story - the events leading up to and following the launch of Sputnik 1. He has done the most thorough job of research on this topic of any author to date, and is especially good at sprinking anecdotes which illustrate the political and personal aspects of the race into space and the aftermath of the Soviet victory.There are some mistakes in the book. Dickson's statement that Sputnik carried only a transmitter and no instrumentation is an error (as he has acknowledged and intends to correct). The author never does prove his claim from the Introduction that President Eisenhower &quot;welcomed the launch.&quot; He does explain well how and why the President, focused on keeping space open for future reconnaissance satellites, was not nearly so upset by Sputnik as most DC politicos were. Dickson also doesn't explain clearly that those who &quot;saw Sputnik&quot; actually saw the booster rocket - the satellite was invisible to the naked eye. Finally, the book has a bit of a padded feel, with asides on everything from The Femininine Mystique to the the creation of the Internet. Some of these are only vaguely related to Sputnik.The general reader won't be put off by the dearth of footnotes, espcially since the chapter notes and bibliography are good. As a fellow space history enthusiast, I would have liked more specific sources for some statements and anecdotes.The bottom line, though, is that this is a valuable addition to space history."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"As a historian of the space race I have read a good deal about the space program. This book is nowhere on my top list of choices. The text of the book contains no citations to sources, you are supposedly directed to the 18 page bibliography to determine where the author got his information. With some of the questionable things stated in this book, I would like to read the appropriate source, or at least know if it came from a book, magazine, or dinner side chat with an uncle.If you know nothing of the early days of the space program, this book does an adequate job of filling you in. However, if you know anything about this period you will find little of interest. The author is, after all, not a space historian, nor did he have an active part in the space age. The author is described in the book jacket as an investigative reporter. I would not recommend this book for someone seriously interested in the history of the space program, US or Soviet.This book contains surprisingly little about Sputnik."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"I lived this and the outcome. This book didn't come close to explaining what happened. 2 menny mistaks!"},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"As a longtime space buff, I looked forward to reading this book about an event that happened before I was born. I found two factual errors that unfortunately left me questioning the authenticity of other facts in the book.On page 41, the book reads &quot;In 1968, as Apollo 11 lifted off for the Moon...&quot; and on page 236 it states &quot;When the space shuttle was first launched in 1982...&quot; These events, of course, happened in 1969 and 1981, and rank among the most important space events ever (along with Sputnik's launch, certainly). How these two dates could be incorrect makes me just a little skeptical that other things I read in the book might just be a little off as well. What if a book on early US history listed Jefferson as the 4th President?I really wanted to like this book, and altough it tended to be a little dry at times, I found many interesting stories and details, but two blatant factual inaccuracies that made it past however many people they made it past before the book's printing left me a little wary of the rest of the content. I don't want to malign the entirety of the author's work for what might be no more than typos, but I just could not get past those two."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"On 4 October 1957, the world woke up in the space age. The first artificial satellite (people were originally calling it an artificial moon) had been successfully launched by the Soviet Union. It weighed less than 200 pounds and was only as big as a basketball, its batteries died after three weeks whereupon it went silent, and after three months aloft it disintegrated upon reentry into the atmosphere. This tiny and ephemeral ball made huge differences in science and the world political climate, and in Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Walker &amp; Co.), Paul Dickson has reviewed them all. He has also given a history of what led up to successful launches of satellites in both the Soviet Union and the US, so that his book is a useful review not just of the first satellite but of twentieth century space exploration in general.The Russians already had a relatively long history of thinking about space before Sputnik went up. The visionary Tsiolovsky was a self-taught scholar who in 1898 created the first formula to specify what sort of power would be needed to send an object up so as not to fall down again. He described that this could be accomplished by a &quot;reaction machine,&quot; which we know as a rocket. He never got to use models, but his first sketch of a spaceship had fuel tanks of liquid oxygen and hydrogen, just as the shuttle uses. He described the use of booster rockets to attain escape velocity. Of course, Dickson tells the fascinating story of our own neglected rocket man, Robert Goddard, who made real rockets and gained over 200 patents, but mostly got only posthumous credit for his accomplishments. And then there was Sergei Korolev, a Red Army Colonel, who, as &quot;chief designer&quot; of the Soviet rocket program, was the man responsible for Sputnik, and for Gagarin's 1961 spaceflight. Little was known about him at the time, because the Soviets wanted their space efforts to be seen as a communal, rather than an individual, effort, and they thought that if he were known, he would be a target for CIA assassination. He had also been imprisoned in the Gulag when Stalin came to believe that rockets would be used to overthrow the government. Dickson reviews the worry with which Americans viewed Sputnik, and how Eisenhower (who was criticized for not worrying enough) actually was pleased that it opened up space for spy satellites.American science and technology were in trouble in some ways. Dickson details the rivalry between the services to claim space as a theater of operations, and the rivalry between military and civilian agencies. There were problems of underfunding of basic research. Science within education needed higher priorities, and for many schools, the Sputnik era was the first time that Darwin could be mentioned. Sputnik resulted in a meaningful American space program, and Dickson's readable and informative re-evaluation of the repercussions of the little aluminum ball shows that it affects us still."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"Paul Dickson argues in his book \\"Sputnik: The shock of the Century\\" that this little 184 pound satellite launched by the Soviets in October 1957 changed the world. He says that it changed the way Americans thought, and that it paved the way for our own space program.I agree that it was a shocking event and quite a blow to the pride of the United States - to see the Soviets launch an artificial Earth orbiting satellite before we could do it? Unheard of! I don't think that it changed the world quite as much as Dickson claims, however.At the close of his book, Dickson says that the two most important marvels of the 20th century were Sputnik and the Internet. Certainly leaves a lot of room for discussion, doesn't it?I believe that Dickson has done us quite a service by writing this book - it is a great history both of the space race up to, and including, an introduction to both the Apollo and Gemini missions of the 1960's, as well as the social history that acompanied this massive PR coup by the Soviets.I especially enjoyed the way that Dickson explained how much America focused on education (science, math, and the like) after the Soviets beat us into space. I also tremendously enjoyed the role of Werner Von Braun in our own efforts to launch a satellite. However, I think that this book easily could have been much, much larger in order to adequately cover the primary topic - Sputnik and all of the ramifications of that fateful day in October."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"To date in my life there have been just a few events that caused me to sit back and rethink everything. The earliest of those events was the launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. The latest was September 11, 2001. In between, the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., President Johnson's decision not to seek re-election, and Watergate had large impacts.Reviewing those events now, the Sputnik launch clearly had the largest impact. I was already space crazy, and had been following the plans for launching satellites as part of the International Geophysical Year with great interest. I had a photograph of the Vanguard rocket in my bedroom. I also knew that the Soviet Union planned a satellite, but assumed that it would come later than Vanguard. Then, pow! Sputnik is sailing around the globe, visible at sunrise and sunset. I also knew that even if we launched Vanguard the next day, it would be puny compared to Sputnik. Clearly, the Soviet Union was years ahead in space. How could that be?Soon, the curriculum in my school was enriched with math and science and a lot of my friends decided to become engineers. Since I was good in both areas, there was a lot of pressure on me to do the same. Of the people with these talents, I was the only one who did not pursue a technical career or teaching science.I was very impressed with this book because it captured the popular reaction to the event at the time, detailed the decisions that led up to the U.S. falling behind, and spells out what happened later (for good and bad). Although over 90 percent of what is in the book was known to me before, I found it helpful to see the pieces all put together in one place. As a result, I feel a sense of closure over Sputnik now for the first time in my life.In directly, I also got a new appreciation for the character of American Society. While reading the book, I compared the reactions here to how the U.S. handled the Gulf War and the terrorist bombings this year with the many mistakes of the Vietnam era. Like all people, we make our share of mistakes, usually when we are feeling overconfident. But we don't like making mistakes, and we then do whatever it takes to do better the next time by not repeating the old errors. For us, once is enough.For those who are old enough to have teenage or adult children, I would recommend that you share this book with them. I do not recall a better book for capturing the mood of the late 1950s and early 1960s in terms of what we were thinking about in the Cold War. This book can help create a link between generations. I'm sure that many young people do not know that many of today's technologies, such as packet switching for the Internet, came as byproducts of the Cold War competition. This book can also help create a connection from the present into the past through observations such as that one.My only quibble with this book is that the subtitle seems overstated. For people who were over age 10 in 1941, I suspect that Pearl Harbor was a bigger shock in the United States. For the whole world, Sputnik may have been the shock of the century, but the book doesn't argue or make that case. But publishers usually pick titles and subtitles, so I'm not going to count this against the author.One continuing lesson of this book is that we still have probably not done the right job of defining our American and worldwide objectives for space. Although we got to the moon in 1969, we couldn't easily get back there again now. Our vision of space needs to be a continuous, contiguous one that expands our knowledge and capabilities efficiently and effectively.Where is America overconfident today? What should we be doing better?Where are you overconfident today? What mistakes may that overconfidence cause you to make?"},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"I read Paul Dickson&#65533;s new book about Sputnik a few days after the events at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The book is very topical, because it portrays a period from the 1950s that has many distressing similarities to our current political climate. Dickson describes a time when America felt that it was under siege -- by Communists rather than terrorists. One even finds phraseology from the period that we are hearing today, with people during the Cold War talking about &#65533;cells&#65533; of Communists just as people now are talking about &#65533;cells&#65533; of terrorists. One of the major lessons from Dickson&#65533;s book is the danger of developing national policy based on knee-jerk public reaction. Dickson describes how after Sputnik was launched, President Eisenhower was under intense pressure to respond quickly. Yet Eisenhower was willing to take the heat in the short term in order to achieve some of his broader long term policy goals vis-&agrave;-vis the Russians. I wonder whether Eisenhower would have been able to stay the course in the face of widespread immediate criticism had he been forced to deal with the barrage of public opinion polls and instant analysis that we have now.Dickson&#65533;s book is a great read. I was born in 1952, so I do not have any memories of the initial Sputnik hysteria in the 1950s. Dickson makes the characters and events from that period come alive. The book is carefully researched, but information about the details and sources are put in an appendix so that readers of the main text will not become bogged down. While the book was written and published before the tragedies of this past September 11, it provided a very useful context to help me better understand some of the responses we are now witnessing."},{"Title":"Sputnik: The Shock of the Century (Science Matters)","review":"If you are buying books on the internet and reading reviews posted in cyberspace, this is a book you must read, because both the information technologies that enable you to read this review, and the culture that values such forms of expression, can be traced to events that followed the launch of Sputnik in October 1957. As Paul Dickson describes, Sputnik was \\"the shock of the century.\\" It was an event which put processes in motion that have shaped our society for half a century.America was a different place in 1957, preoccupied with returning to the cultural norms that had existed before the disruption of World War II and the rise of communism. Government was small and largely uninvolved in education, research, or social change. Public schools emphasized the \\"three Rs\\" and local values. Colleges and universities had swelled in size to meet the needs of WWII veterans, but remained largely focused on intellectual pursuits. Industry had turned its attention from building weapons, to meeting the seemingly insatiable demand for consumer products. The military was shrinking, confident that America had a commanding lead in technology, which could neutralize any threat from the larger military forces of communist nations.All of that changed the night of October 22, 1957 when the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik. It would be months before the United States could do the same.Americans no longer felt secure. In response to the ascendancy of communist technologies, Congress rapidly put in place new programs that would ultimately transform American society. The Advanced Research Projects Administration (ARPA) was created to lead massive new initiatives in advanced technology, computing, and applied research. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established to coordinate America's push into space. Hundreds of billions of dollars would be invested to build great research centers that would bring together military, industrial, and academic interests to assure America's technological supremacy. Also, Congress would also pass the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) to ensure that public schools produced an new generation of scientists and engineers.The results were dramatic. In a little more than a decade, America would launch hundreds of satellites and win the race to the moon. America's universities, defense establishments, and commercial enterprises would invent microchips, computer networks, and new methods in chemistry, physics, and biology that would provide the foundation for an age of technology. Perhaps even more important, traditional education would be reformed to emphasize independent inquiry, invention, exploration, and expression and sow the seeds for the Age of Aquarius. Fifty years later, we live in a world of ubiquitous personal computers, the world wide web, MySpace, and YouTube, all of which can be traced directly to the ideas and initiatives that were a response to the \\"shock of the century.\\"How did all of this happen? That's what Paul Dickson describes what happened in a compelling, carefully researched, and readable of the events that transpired around the launch of Sputnik.

Dickson's account of \\"the shock of the century,\\" the Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik, is written in an easily read, but truly revelatory style. Dickson has done his homework. His research into classified files and information only accessible since the demise of the USSR allows him to tell a story and a back-story we could not have previously known. There are famous characters here. I assure you, whether you are left-leaning, or neo-con, you will welcome his perspective on Presidents Eisenhower, Johnson, and Kennedy. You may not have known of the Soviet scientists Tsiolkovsky and Korolev, but you will be glad that Dickson has told their stories and the tale of the dog, the cosmutt, Laika, too.And, of course, the former Nazi Wernher von Braun's. Von Braun pops up throughout the book: a handsome suave genius who will build a rocket that can orbit a satellite if only you will give him marks, rubles, or dollars; slave labor, interned labor, or union labor.As you might have gathered, Dickson's book is not about the number of rivets in Sputnik, nor the calculus equations that slide-rule men wrote to send the bright satellite with its meaningless meaningful constant beep around our globe. It's about a moment when America pivoted. When Americans decided that what was, was not good enough. We needed a plan, and success.The director of the American Institute of Physics at that time said that the American way of life was \\"doomed to rapid extinction\\" unless the nation's youth could be taught the importance of science. Such were the stakes.Dickson ends his book with this, which gives I think a sense of this intelligent and nuanced work:\\"The United States could have put the earth's first satellite in orbit [but its] third stage was a dummy. American honor would have been assuaged at the beginning of the space age, but it might have led . . to a much different resolution of the Cold War.

Each of the primary thrust chambers provided 56,000 pounds of thrust for a total of 1,120,000 pounds.2. Page 106 states: \\"The three stage rocket...\\"The R-7 configuration for the first three Sputniks was essentially a 1 stage rocket. All engines ignited at liftoff. When the four outer packets depleted their fuel, they were released leaving the central core to continue thrusting to orbital speed. There were no upper stages at this point.3. Page 107 states: \\"Ninety-six minutes and seventeen seconds later, Sputnik passed over its launchpad with its transmitter sending out a beeping noise that blared from Baikonur's loudspeakers.\\"Because of the earth's rotation, the launch site moves east several hundred miles (about 1000 miles per hour at the equator diminishing proportionally at the higher latitudes.) so subsequent orbital passes are offset. Sputnik could not have over flown its launch site at the end of its first orbit.4. Page 181 states: \\"On March 23... the 30.66 pound Explorer III went aloft...\\".The correct date is March 26.5. Page 199 states: \\"That night the four-ton Air Force Atlas ICBM was fired into orbit from Cape Canaveral, making it by far the largest object yet to circle the globe.This is a common misconception that was promoted by the US at the time. As noted in my Item 2, the entire core stage of the R-7 actually entered orbit for the first three Sputniks. The soviets never identified the weight of this unit because they did not want to give any indication of the R-7 configuration. This stage was about 90 feet in length and weighed in excess of 12,000 pounds.6. Page 247 states: \\"... those working with the launch vehicle were ordered to make sure that the third stage was a dummy\\".Jupiter-C was designed as a four stage rocket. Thus it was the fourth stage that was inert. The first three stages were fired for the nose cone tests."},{"Title":"Plants, Genes, and Crop Biotechnology","review":"This book contains twenty chapters plus a comprehensive index. Each chapter is written by a distinguished individual in his or her field. Each chapter consists of general opening remarks, detailed information about the subject of each chapter, a chapter summary at the end of each chapter, discussion questions and a list of references for further reading. The lead authors have created a text that would serve double duty as either an adequate text for an introductory lower division course on agronomy/plant sciences, or as a supplemental text for an upper division plant biology course which looks at the social and ethical dimensions of biotechnology and genetically modified organisms.All the contributors share the belief that agricultural biotechnology in its current manifestation is merely an extension of biology in the natural world, and is but one consequence of Watson & Crick's monumental discovery. Chrispeels and Sadava, the two contributors responsible for compiling the text, boldly state that the biggest beneficiaries of the new GM technology will be those living in the developing countries, and as such reflects the standard party line of the pro-ag-biotech groups and organizations.All inherent biases aside, the book is highly notable because of several bold admissions made throughout the text. First, the authors readily admit that agricultural biotechnology has no defensible place or justification in a world currently awash in plentiful food, but at the same time, they do believe that biotechnology will play an important role in tomorrow's world agriculture. Second, the also readily concede that distribution of food, and not its production, is the main culprit for hunger, but other issues do play an important role. Related to this is their admission that the ability to pay for food matters more than the supply of food itself; if people can pay for it, they will get it (here their words on the subject echo many of the thoughts put forth by Amartya Sen, and before him, Susan George). Third, they admit that most scientists working in the field of population and demography in the late 1960s and early 1970s made flat out wrong predictions about the infamous 'population bomb', and that predictions made today many not come to pass tomorrow- they are just guesses about the future. Here they appear to be backing away from the incendiary rhetoric of environmental luminaries such as Paul Ehrlich and Lester Brown. Fourth, and quite possibly the boldest admission of the text, was their concession that agricultural biotechnology has been oversold. Apparently, they saw fit to stop short of saying that ag-biotech has been and continues to be hyped into the stratosphere, but their very admission alone is satisfactory, as they later lay most of the blame for today's hysteria and urban myths surrounding ag-biotech and GM technologies upon the overselling of the technologies, where it justifiably belongs.Indeed, the authors' concern for the overselling of the promise and potential of biotechnology is readily apparent in the final chapter of the book, where they address the myths and realities of agricultural biotechnology. However, even the authors can not resist the temptation to sell the reader on the potential benefits of an agricultural biotechnology, and the book includes chapters on integrated pest management incorporating the scientific advances of ag-biotech (Chapter 16), weed control strategies using biotechnology (Chapter 17), GM technology as a tool for promoting green agriculture (Chapter 18), and the use of plants as biological factories (Chapter 19).Generally speaking, Chapters 1 through 5 lay down the rationale for incorporation of ag-biotech in food production, and chapters 6 through 15 explain the how to, the ins and outs of the technology and how genetic modification of crops is achieved. Also, chapters 6 through 15 cover all the standard topics one would find in a regular course on agronomy, crop science and plant biology, from plant cell and molecular biology, plant growth and development, seeds and seed technology, the ins and outs of photosynthesis and the physical, biological and environmental factors associated with it, soils and root zone systems, nitrogen cycling, to the historical basis for crop breeding (with some paleo-anthropological perspectives) and the gradual leap from breeding via classical techniques to modern, biotech based methods. Chapter 15 also looks at crop disease and its management from a molecular genetic standpoint, and strikes me as a means to include students in plant pathology.Additionally, the authors paid considerable attention to the problems and challenges of agriculture in Third World countries, in an attempt to demonstrate the veracity of their belief that GM technology can do much to assist the inhabitants there. However, in the process, they belatedly demonstrate that these technologies have been developed to address symptoms of more complex and fundamental problems having an economic, environmental and/or socio-historical basis. Yet, the authors must be credited for admitting that the real need in developing countries is for more research support to address their specific physical and environmental conditions, and for demonstrating that in every single instance where consumer incomes rise and the socio-economic status of women advances, there is an inevitable decrease in birth rates, hunger and malnutrition.Thus, the contributors freely admit that their research and scientific activities chase phantom problems and non-problems. They also admit, albeit obliquely, that ag-biotech in its current manifestation does not address the needs or the fundamental problems faced in the developing or the developed world. In fact, on the one hand, researchers have occupied themselves with testing the limits of GM technology, seeing what they can do, and exploring different directions, while on the other hand, government institutions and corporations have directed their efforts at technological developments for which they have proprietary control, and increasingly, total control over distribution and other supporting activities. Alas, the authors have chosen, perhaps unwisely, to offer any comments on this state of affairs, and what it may mean for everyone.In sum, this book makes quite a few bold admissions, some directly, but most indirectly, and as such, is a necessary read for those interested in the topics of ag-biotech, genetic modification technologies, food production and safety, and crop science in general. It is definitely a good and comprehensive book, containing a level of honesty highly uncommon among textbooks on the subject(albeit couched among questionable pitches about potential benefits of ag-biotech), and its sources for further reading are indispensable. I highly recommend the text to anyone looking to place this contentious scientific topic within a social and ethical context."},{"Title":"Plants, Genes, and Crop Biotechnology","review":"regular textbook, general info.

Each chapter of the book ends with a &quot;Summing Up&quot; paragraph (especially helpful in the scientific section)that helps you remember what you just read.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what is happening inside his/her body.

They both have strengths and they both have weaknesses. But it is a terrific spiritual journey reading good books from men on both sides of the argument! Unfortunately, much sensationalism and over-speculation accompanies far too many books by Dispensational authors. There is none of that with McClain. Parts One and Two are really good. I was especially blessed by his demonstration of other \\"time-gap\\" passages in Scripture (such as Isaiah 61:1-2 and Christ's quoting of it in Luke 4 where He stops short of reading the rest of the passage as it relates to His Second Coming not His First; therefore we have a time gap of almost 2,000 years that wouldn't be apparent from a straightforward reading of the Isaiah passage). Why, therefore, can't we have a time gap between Daniel's 69th and 70th week? McClain writes with a gracious attitude towards those of a different persuasion. This is a highly significant prophetic passage of Scripture, and I highly recommend McClain's treatment of it."},{"Title":"Daniel's Prophecy of the 70 Weeks","review":"If you are looking for a compact handbook of doctrine on Daniel's seventieth week to carry with you, this is the one. Its pages cover many key teachings from one of the most reliable teachers and editors of the New Scofield Reference Bible. I recommend this little help to any who are witnessing to someone or looking for help themselves on this area of prophecy."},{"Title":"Daniel's Prophecy of the 70 Weeks","review":"This pamphlet, written by the late Dr. Alva McClain and titled \\"Daniel's Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks,\\" was originally published in 1940 and is a good study concerning the prophetic future of Israel given to the Prophet Daniel. The study focuses primarily on an abundance of prophetic information in Daniel chapter 9. McClain's pamphlet describes key events in Daniel which will take place during Israel's seventieth week, the time of Jacob's trouble (Jeremiah 30:7). Dr. McClain was the president of Grace Theological Seminary for 25 years. His commentary on Romans and his books titled Law and Grace and Greatness of the Kingdom are also good reads.McClain divides his pamphlet into three parts. The first part is a relatively non-technical exposition of the first sixty-nine weeks of Daniel's prophecy about Israel. In doing so, he covers in some detail the Hebrew word for \\"weeks\\" and how the word, plus context and application determines its meaning. The reader needs to be aware at this point that in calculating the period of the sixty-nine weeks, a calculator would be helpful because, yes, there is some math involved! One reviewer evidently gave up the books at this point. He or she thought there was just too much \\"numerology.\\"In Part 2, McClain describes the two major conclusions--the \\"Continuous\\" and the \\"Gap\\" interpretations. His defense of the \\"Gap\\" interpretation (an interval of time between the end of the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks) is about as convincing an argument as I have read, especially considering its brevity. I especially appreciated his use of OT examples like Isaiah 61:1-2 and curiously a verse right in Daniel's prophecy that is often overlooked, but if studied carefully, does describe events that must occur beyond the sixty-ninth and before the seventieth weeks.In Part 3, McClain does a quick overview of his conclusions from parts one and two. Then he used the latter verses of Daniel chapter 9, the book of Revelation and Matthew chapter 24 to begin identifying the significant events that occur in the seventieth week, which according to McClain, match the seven-year period of the Tribulation. Up to this point, he had done an excellent job of citing and supporting his conclusions. Although in this section, some of his assertions lacked the defined support in the first two parts. Such as when he emphatically states that \\"the prince to come\\" will rise from an area in the old Roman Empire, yet he doesn't provide any justification. From that conclusion he simply begins referring to this person as the \\"Roman prince\\" throughout the rest of the pamphlet.He does this again when he confidently identifies in 2 Thessalonians 2:7, \\"For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way\\" the Spirit-dwelt Church as the \\"one\\" who is the restraining power. Again, McClain makes no attempt to explain or support this assertion. There are a few others in Part 3 that are not worth mentioning.Even though this is just a pamphlet, McClain adds a nice Appendix at the end with additional comment and cited references for Parts 1 and 2, and some historical information for Part 3. Since this book was written so long ago, the KJV is the primary text used, and the American Standard Version (ASV) (1901) is also used to bring a fuller, more modern translation. One thing I must also add is that McClain's pamphlet is not written with the spectacular flair and sensationalism that usual accompanies prophetic and last-days books. He also mentions by name those with whom he disagrees with the respect one would give a peer. Both of these were refreshing and make my recommendation for this pamphlet much easier to do. This pamphlet is highly recommended, regardless of your eschatology persuasion."},{"Title":"Daniel's Prophecy of the 70 Weeks","review":"This book is excellent and I am adding it to my personal library.

I am required to read them for seminary and while they don't put me to sleep or make me urp in my mouth, I probably wouldn't read this book if it weren't a requirement. There is a general lack of exegetical depth, however, McClain's views are more scriptural than some. He tends to spout off vague scripture references like machine gun fire rather than aiming carefully for accurate in depth exegesis. This is the kind of \\"proof-texting\\" that gives evangelicals a bad name.

The fountains bubble with life. The cobbled streets lead to some of the most fetching homes and buildings in the world. The Provencal people dress their windows in lace and paint the exterior and interior of their homes in the colors found in the Provencal landscape: blue, yellow, ochre, greens. Terracotta roofs provide the most wonderful color and texture to the landscape. Somehow everything blends wonderfully! The creators of The Most Beautiful Villages in Provence capture the essence of this southern region of France. The photography vividly presents the viewer with a panorama of gorgeous scenes: fields of lavender, geraniums in pots leading to a beautiful door, roof top views that are breathtaking, undulating paths that take you to splendid spots, aerial views of villages, an old roman road and bridge. A friend of mine, who was born in Provence, gave me this incredibly beautiful book; the only thing better, she says, is to be there! I plan to take this book with me to Provence next summer!!

Pure disappointment... Even though the quality of the pictures is nice, they do not give you a true view of the relevant villages. They are pictures taken at random that do not represent - sometimes - the best view of the village.But what is most dissapoiting in this book is the poor information about the villages, its populations, culture and location. In my opinion, every descrition of each village should also contain a map of its location in southern France (for us to know how could one get there), its population (to see how big it is), a some info on the villages picturesque points, etc. The few paragraphs dedicated to each village are too vague.Finally, I think the editor should have made this book differently with half the villages and twice the pictures and info about them. I gave 2 stars for the pictures."},{"Title":"The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence.","review":"I love this book! It effectively captures the drama and charm of Provence.

So it is convenient that \\"The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence\\" is divided into several chapters according to the different parts of the region:Vaucluse and Bouches-du-Rhone, Var and Alpes-Maritimes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. It depicts the essence of the serene village lifestyle with its breathtaking photos of the houses and the nature. There are also all kinds of interesting historical facts about the origins of each village and people who lived there or visited them - Provence has attracted poets, artists and musicians throughout its history.At the end of the book there is a useful information section for visitors: hotels and restaurants, market days and festivals."},{"Title":"The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence.","review":"This is an exquisite book of photography, capturing the \\"quaintness\\" and even antiquity of the villages of Provence. 35 villages are featured, grouped by departement. The sections cover the Vaucluse and Bouches-du-Rhone, Var and Alpes-Maritimes, and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. I found the villages of the later section the most interesting, primarily due to their remoteness. The picture of Entrevaux, on pages 188-9 is particularly inspiring. For those on the first tour, well-trodden Gordes and St.-Paul-de-Vence are also represented. Several villages in the Luberon are also featured, including Peter Mayle's old \\"haunt\\" of Menerbes. Alas, Uzes, in the Gard is missing, as is the unique Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer. The pictures of each village are accompanied by a succinct summary of its history by Michael Jacobs.I was disappointed that only a small number of photos were of the people of these villages, certainly the essential element of village life. There were no markets, only a few children and elders, and no fetes. Primarily the photos are of stone, fortunately well-composed ones. In terms of photography books on Provence, I prefer Gerald Sioen, who is much better at capturing the people in these villages. But \\"quaintness\\" is a rapidly fading quality, as the real world of \\"uncropped\\" experiences will attest, wither it is the A-7 or the TGV. Both Sioen and Palmer had to photograph the same ancient \\"Droguerie\\" in Cotignac, both capturing it in the same dabbled light.Still, Provence remains a unique treasure of sensual enjoyment, and hopefully you can afford to buy both, or even better, receive them as Christmas presents from friends and relatives with their priorities in the right place."},{"Title":"The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence.","review":"I am French and was born in Provence, so I have spent most of my days there, except when I travel and when I was modeling in the world of high fashion.

I am not good at taking the pictures, like these men do, and besides, I always do the flying. My sister would have to do the picture making. If you buy this book, you will be able to see my beautiful Provence in the pictures whenever you want to. Provence is very old and very picturesque, that is why the photography is so good. If it was not a most beautiful place in the world, it could not be so beautiful of a book. I am French and so I know it is this beautiful. It is more beautiful in the real world, if you can even think that. We have lots of cobble streets. Everyone loves the flowers, so you will see most beautiful flowers everywhere you look in Provence. We have hidden waters that come out into our special fountains. Every village must have their fountains and some are very, very old and are more special than any place else in the world. We like things to be beautiful, so you never see anything ugly in Provence. The earth is very good to us. We have herbs growing everywhere in the countryside. Lavender, Rosemary, and Thyme, you can find just walking in our wonderful hills. We love colors in Provence. Blue, yellow, ochre,green, we like all of those colors. Marcel Pagnol lived in Provence, too. He made his films and his books because he loved Provence. He was French.

If so, this is the essential travel and history reference for 25 of the best sites in the 20 million square miles of the Pacific theater. As this book proves, even for those who only dream about travel, it is still an impressive reference to the history and sites today.25 Best Pacific SiteAuthor Chuck Thompson draws from his vast travel experiences to present the best sites of the Pacific. He begins the book by explaining the criteria for rating the 'best' sites of the Pacific, by three equally important criteria: historical significance, the amount of attractions at a give site, and finally on its merits as a travel destination (services, natural beauty, desirability). Although subjective, it is a excellent rating system. That includes Pearl Harbor, Guadalcanal, Battan, Tokyo, Tarawa, Saipan, River Kwai, China, Alaska, Hiroshima, Corregidor, Singapore, Peleliu, Marshalls, Guam, Okinawa, Leyte, Solomons, Papua New Guinea, Manila and Nagasaki, to name a few. The final chapter covers North American Pacific WWII sites - including museums and memorials, and general details on auxiliary sites that are more difficult or expensive to get to, such as: Burma, Indonesia, Eniwetak, Midway, Wake and Iwo Jima.Travel Guide ReferenceA chapter is devoted to each of the 25 locations, complete with sites of interest and detailed maps. A one to five 'star rating' system rates each site, in terms of its interest level. Although all sites are important, the star system helps travelers with limited time, or budgets choose what they will want to see. Also, Thomoson draws upon his own travel experiences and suggests the ranges of time required to see the WWII sites - everything from a single full day in some locations, to several days in order to reach all sites.Well Known & Obscure Location DetailsEach chapter covers a wide range of both well known sites, and more obscure ones. For instance, in the Ohau chapter, the natural importance of Pearl Harbor Memorial is fully detailed, but also, lesser known sites, like the \\"Natsunoya Teahouse\\" where Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa conducted much of his surveillance of Pearl Harbor. Also, lesser known and out of the way sites, like the barracks, airfields and forts of signifigance. Each details any special permissions, limited access, contact information, entry fees and other related information.More Than A Travel GuideAuthor Chuck Thompson has done more than just write a travel guide book, in the traditional sense of the term. Each chapter begins with an informative, concise and well researched historical summary of each of the 25 best sites. Also, a list of suggested reading & references related to that location, that includes history books, veteran memoirs and reading.For those that dream of exotic Pacific travels, and even those who have already been to some of the 25 best sites, this guide book come highly recommended, and a worthy addion to your history library too, for prespective on the wartime sites today. After completing the book, any reader will be tempted to travel to one, or all 25 of these sites - as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"25 Best World War II Sites Pacific Theater (Greenline Historic Travel)","review":"Chuck Thompson has done an excellent job in THE 25 BEST WORLD WAR II SITES, PACIFIC THEATER of informing and recommending, to war buffs and casual travelers alike, the best World War places to see including Pearl Harbor on Oahu, the route of the Bataan Death March in the Philippines, and the original Bridge on the River Kwai in Thailand.Hundreds of points of interest are revealed in the book, and Thompson provides comprehensive directions for each site, including detailed maps, guides to hotels, insider tips and photos of the sites.This was the first book I've read by Chuck Thompson and I am definitely interested in checking out some of his other work because of the throughness of his research and the objective tone throughout."},{"Title":"25 Best World War II Sites Pacific Theater (Greenline Historic Travel)","review":"I thought this was a great book.

Looking forward to visiting Peleliu soon!"},{"Title":"25 Best World War II Sites Pacific Theater (Greenline Historic Travel)","review":"I consulted this book on a recent trip to Japan with a focus on visitng Japanese war memorials. My review is concerned with the chapters on Hiroshima, Nagasaki/Kyushu, Tokyo, and Okinawa. I was diaappointed by the incomplete nature of the book and lack of directions on how to get to some of the places described.First off, the Kyushu/Nagasaki chapter is really only about Nagasaki. The author does briefly mention the Kamikaze Peace Museum at Chiran, which is dedicated to the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) pilots who flew kamikaze missions. There is no mention of the Japanese Naval Museum at Kanoya, where the memorial to the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) kamikaze pilots is located. The two memorials are similar, but the IJN memorial has many interesting artifacts, such as a reconstructed Zero, much information of Japanese naval aviation, pieces of the Betty bomber shot down while carrying Admiral Yamamoto, and a large display of and special memorial to the pilots of the Okha rocket bombs.The Hiroshima chapter covers the usual ground, but misses the memorial at Hiroshima castle located in the south wall of the castle, the former communications bunker, dedicated to the girls from the Hiyajima Girls High School who manned the switchboards on August 6, 1945.An interesting side trip from Hiroshima that is not mentioned in the book is the island of Okunoshima, where the Poison Gas Warfare Museum is located. This small two-room musuem and the remains of the poison-gas factory on the island, as well as the myriad rabbits that give the island its nickname \\"Bunny Island\\" (much better for the tourist trade than \\"Poison Gas Factory Island\\"), can seen in a couple of hours. A local train to Tadanoumi station drops one off within a five-minute walk of the ferry. A 12-minute ferry ride takes you to the island, where there is a small resort.The Okinawa chapter was disappointing in that it seemed to be a long advertisement for the services of a local guide. Contrary to this book and other guide books, it is easy to get around Okinawa by public buses. You can easily visit the Naval Underground HQ, the Peace Memorial Museum, the Himeyuri Monument and Museum, and Shuri Castle. A useful addition to this guide would have been a map to the prefectural monuments at the Peace Museum, as well as at Konpaku No To.The Maizuru Repartriation Museum is worth a side trip from Kyoto. What the author fails to mention is that the museum is located in East Maizuru, which is Higashi Maizuru, (there is also a West Maizuru), and is about 4 miles from the train station. The public bus that goes by the museum runs about once every 90 minutes, so you may wish to add in a trip to the World Brick Museum, which is a refurbished IJN torpedo warehouse, while waiting for the bus out.In the rather short Tokyo chapter, the author misses the Tokyo Air Raid Memorial at Yokoami-Cho Park, which is located a block north of the Tokyo-Edo Museum. The Museum as an excellent display on the air raids, showing a typical Japanese home, and neighborhood firefighting equipment, as well as interactive maps and a display of a Japanese balloon bomb.While not a WWII site, mention should be made of the battleship Mikasa in Yokosuka, about 1 hour 40 minutes from Tokyo station. It's the only pre-dreadnought still around, and the displays on ths ship are excellent in Japanese and English.The review of the Maritime Museum in Tokyo is dated, as the Kawanishi H8K Emily flying boat is no longer there, but at the Japanese Naval Museum in Kanoya (see above).All in all, while the book provided some information, it lacks information on local transport and many sites of interest in the locations that it does cover."},{"Title":"25 Best World War II Sites Pacific Theater (Greenline Historic Travel)","review":"Chuck Thompson has compiled a great book on World War II sites in the Pacific.

This book succeeds on all three points.I was not previously aware of the multiple uses or depth of the RSI indicator. This book shows how to discern underlying market currents that are not readily obvious through other means. If you are interested in technical indicators, this work might prove to be a profitable read."},{"Title":"RSI: The Complete Guide","review":"Unfortunately there are not very many books on the RSI indicator, or I would have never considered this publication. Although there are a few useful concepts that may be unique with John Hayden, much of what is discussed has been around for quite awhile (80/40 and 60/20, hidden divergences, etc.). Other than support and resistance, RSI patterns are never even discussed. The main complaint here is that the book is absolutely riddled with errors, and many of them in key areas of discussion.For example: The numbers in the spreadsheet illustrating the RSI formula construction do not add correctly. The author skips from RSI rule #1 to #3 with no mention of #2. Many of the reference labels discussed in the text are missing in the charts. At least one chart is shown in a different time zone than what is under discussion in the text. Be assured, this is only a very small sampling. I have read a few discussions of this book in various trading forums and their complaints are considerably more harsh than mine.I find it amazing how this book made into publication with so many errors. The whole book, from cover design to content is very unprofessional, especially for the price. I have since contacted the author and publishers inquiring about updates. There has been no response."},{"Title":"RSI: The Complete Guide","review":"Minus the mistakes (assuming there were, though I have not done the findings), it is a great book on RSI.

The only thing this book has going for it is that there isn't much out there on RSI. Yes it is true, a bullish trend is between 40-80 and a bearish trend is between 20-60, however the author does not really explain how to really tell when there is a shift from bullish to bearish and vice versa. I am far from sold on the whole divergence thing allthough it does work from time to time. There is a much simpler way to tell when price is consoladating and how to tell when it is breaking out of consolodation and which direction.Frankly, I think I am going to write my own book on RSI because it is desperately needed."},{"Title":"RSI: The Complete Guide","review":"This has to be one of the poorest written and edited books on trading. It starts early with an error in the equation for RSI (not to worry, the appendix that goes into more detail also has at least one error in the spreadsheet). The charts need a magnifying glass to read. But even a magnifying glass won't help in finding points that are referred to in the text, but not marked on the chart. I guess we'll have to wait for Cardwell to finally publish."},{"Title":"The Chianti Family Cookbook: Classic Recipes from the Heart of Tuscany","review":"This September I went to Tuscany for a visit of the wine country...among our tour of the country side, we were fortunate to tour Giovanna's vineyard, take a cooking lesson from her and eat lunch for which she prepared.

I read this book more than twenty years ago and recently purchased it on Amazon. It still shocks me to my core. Every American should read this account of the descent into hell (Treblinka). It gives credence to our inalienable rights as Americans and our ethics in a world that can easily slip over the precipe."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"Used this book for one of my classes, incredible stories, something everyone should get a chance to read, so hopefully history won't repeat itself."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I read this book in four days, and the last 1/3 of it in a single sitting.The place, Treblinka was the first of the \\"mass-production\\" Jewish extermination-murder camps operated by Nazi Germany. About 800,000 Jews were murdered/buried there (then dug up and cremated to hide the crime). It operated for about a year in 1942-43 and ended in a massive, successful revolt by the inmates. Some of these survived to reveal the story of the secret place, Treblinka.I have read a few Holocaust genre' books including non-fictional works (The Enduring Spirit, Night, The Hiding Place), and historical fiction accounts (War and Remembrance). Horrifying and heartbreaking as those were, I have never read anything quite like Treblinka, by Jean-Francois Steiner.Treblinka is presented as a non-fictional history of what happpened the the camp. The author apparently takes license (reasonable I believe) regarding much dialogue and a few detailed situations, but reading between the lines closely, one can see that the content of the book is taken from intensively researched written and oral witness accounts. The book reads like a suspense-adventure novel. If it was indeed just a fictional novel, many would find the content objectionable. The situations are extreme.That the author accurately decribes the hellish conditions and atmosphere of hunger, beatings, torture, and death in the camp is a given. I suspect that many readers, including myself at one time, open their first Holocaust-related history as a curious spectator taking a peek at the horror, insulated by the safe shield of time and space. However . . .Steiner superbly helps the reader to understand more: Why did most Jews march obediently into the cattle cars with their families in tow? Why did they quietly march to the gas houses? Who were these walking skeletons (forked men) stacking rotting bodies in the mass graves, and what was their life like? (Wouk touched on them briefly in War and Remembrance). Why did the Germans expend resources operating an extermination industry when there was a (losing) war to be fought? Why the Nazi cruelty and who were these men?You can't really get all the answers into one book, but this one is better than the field. I also very much appreciated the insight into the Jewish religious aspect (which was often key to their behaviors). Steiner did an awesome and gripping job of explaining the world of Treblinka. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"this book is the epitome of reality written in the style of a novel. As Steiner says, the novel approach is the only way to bring you into the full force of the story. Riveting--is a mild word to describe this book. We NEED this book to keep history in focus."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"...Steiner brings it all out, all aspects including actual Aryans falling for their own tricks and being sent there, only to be executed because of fear that the secret of \\"extermination\\" might be brought public. Well, we all know the truth now.Steiner gives us good insight into the lives of not only the prisoners themselves, but also the camp Kapos and guards. One of the main characters, Galewski, is the head Kapo for most of the book, and he is humanized despite the fact he beats and assists in the murder of his own Jewish people, along with his Kapo comrade Kurland, who runs the \\"Hospital\\", where people are supposedly given medicine shots that really kill them.Also, info into the exploits of Nazi poster 'Children of hypocrisy' such as Max Bielas and the table waiter turned mass murderer Kurt Franz are told.The only thing I found questionable about this book was the lack of info on a scale of overall proven fact. The infamous Franz Stangl has no major bearing on the book, which I found odd, since the Nuremburg Trials has him listed big time. Also, the book paints this sadistic picture of Kurt Franz, yet he was one of the few who wasn't sentenced to death for his SS activities.Either way, I've never read a more in depth book on Treblinka. Can't lose on this one."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I bought this book for a research paper I had to do for a composition class and I ended up reading the entire thing because of how good the book was. It is excellently written and tells the story of what happened inside the concentration camps without getting technical or making it simple. The book is truely inspiring and is one that everybody should read."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"This book does a wonderful job of detailing what life may have been like for people inside Treblinka and in that respect belongs on everyone's shelf along with classic Holocaust books like Primo Livi's Survival in Auschwitz. However, Steiner's book does have one fatal flaw for serious students of history looking for \\"facts.\\" Much of this book is in fact, fiction."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"This book started well, bu then gradually falled. THe ending is very poor. But, anyway, it give us a great description of the tragedy, of how jews helped Germans to kill Jews, in order to survive."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"This is a book about an armed revolt in a Nazi concentration camp. Unlike Archipelag Gulag, this is mostly fiction. Such a revolt did take place but the events and descriptions of camp life are not accurate. Nevertheless, it is a very entertaining read. Extremely suspenseful and well written."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I am no holocaust historian so I cannot comment on the book being fact or fiction. The book is, however, a VERY compelling read. I literally had trouble putting this down. The writing is very vivid and it is a extremely thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I don't need to go into detail about how moving this book is. Other reviewers have already done that, and have done a better job than I could hope to.Instead, I want to emphasize what makes this particular book important. One of the earlier reviewers pointed out how this book explained the history, the mentality of the European Jewry, and why the Nazis were able to put them into camps relatively easily. The second aspect of this book that is vital to understanding the holocaust is that Steiner also shows how the death camps were developed: How the Germans resolved the technical and psychological problems connected with mass extermination. For example, an early version of the gas chamber involved trucks, with the exhaust directed to a contained hold. A driver just had to drive to a set destination, and on arrival, all the people in the back would be dead. This \\"clever\\" plan failed, because the drivers couldn't stand what they were doing: they all drove too fast, and the prisoners did not have time to suffocate. But from that first concept, the idea of the death chamber came to be.For people today, who weren't there, you need to read this book to appreciate what was involved in this unprecedented mass destruction, all with 1930s technology."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I have been an underdog in many situations but never stopped fighting - that is the essence of life, that shows you are alive. When ever I read about the Holocaust stories - one question intrigues me again and again - why didn't they fight back? Now we see that Israel as a country is most aggressive and fights back to the Arab terrorism (kicks their ass). So when you see the same folk during pre world war, you will notice the strange lack of resistance. They just gave way to the Nazi, in-fact to everybody in all the east European countries and they were butchered. Pogrom was the fashion in every country.Treblinka is a different story - different genre. It is story of resistance, the will to fight back, the power to resist even when all odds are against some one. This book should be an encouragement to all the downtrodden and underdogs who are kicked by the society for no reason. This is story of resistance and a rare victory of the conscience.The book goes into amazing detail of the German killing machine and how Jews were used as a part of the system to kill other Jews. Even today I have seen the same thing happen in corporate America. Once you mention that 50% of a group will be cut and only the top performers will be retained you will notice how hard the employees work to bring their coworkers down.What bothers me more that all these Germans were also human beings but the effect of the Nazi brain wash went to such a degree that humanity ceased to exist within them? To the Nazi's the question of good or bad, ethical or non-ethical never even arose - it was how fast or how slow you are going to kill the Jews and what kind of death do they deserve.I have read Primo Levi, Weisel, Borowski but this is by far the best. Tragedy must have a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel otherwise it is too depressing - Treblinka has the glimpse of light (it is more of a rainbow). Please read it if you get a chance"},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the ins and outs of a Nazi death camp. However,,if you are a true history buff I suggest that you read the afterward before you read the rest of the book. The author takes some liberties which are not proper in a true historical treatment. I did enjoy it found it to be a good primer on the subject."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"Much has been written about the Holocaust. Numerous books exist about Hitler, the Jews, the SS, and the concentration camps. Yet \\"Treblinka\\" by Jean-Francois Steiner sets itself apart from all the others, by actually placing the reader inside the horrors of the concentration camp. The camp at Treblinka was to become a model for the great death factories, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau. Yet, in 1943, the prisoners of Treblinka were able to mount a successful revolt and burn the death camp to the ground.Steiner begins his narrative with a look at life in the ghetto. One of the questions that has plagued writters of the Holocaust, is how the Jews seemed to willingly accept their death as their fate. Steiner lays out the webwork of the Nazi Technicians, who manipulated the Jews' submissive nature by making them second guess and question every advantage and disadvantage. The Jews accepted death, but they honored life. Despite all of their sufferings, the prisoners of Treblinka were able to revolt against a vicious enemy and escape their nightmare lives. They knew that hardly anyone in the outside world would believe their tales; through various sources, the Jews learned how their stories of the death camps were met with incredulous ears, by Jews and others who refused to accept the truth. Yet when the entire camp of Treblinka faced liquidation (once the exhumed bodies of the more than 700,000 Jews who had been killed were burned) they chose to honor live so that someone could live to tell their story.\\"Treblinka\\" is a powerful read. Of the six-hundred prisoners who escaped the death camp, forty of them survived to bear witness to what they had seen the Germans do to the Jewish people. Steiner has recreated the painful, stifling atmosphere of Treblinka through these accounts, and has taken liberty in recreating conversations to advance the story's narrative. However, this does not detract from the truth at hand. These prisoners faced insurmountable odds and death with every miscalculation. Their actions are extraordinary and beyond measure. Steiner has created a truly magnificent memorial to those who lost their lives, and those who fought to bear witness."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"This is without a doubt one of the better books about the death camps. You will become intimately acquainted with Treblinka and the Nazis who ran it. Steiner's book is well-written and does justice to the horror."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"It's difficult to understand how this genocide could happen without first understanding the deeply ingrained anti-Semiticsm and racial jealousy that preceded it. This book helps to illustrate that and more.Some revisionists point to Nazi film footage of Jews wearing yellow stars playing music, eating and dancing. They say this proves that the holocaust is a hoax. In this book one can see the bitter irony of how a people of honor and humanity can kill their own brethren by day and sing and dance by night - all while in captivity, under the watchful eyes of guards who can strike them down at any moment. It's so insane that it's a challenge to explain and and comprehend and yet the book manages to capture it.This book is also a study of humanity - from the irrational desire to survive at all costs, to the strong human characteristic of organization. Humans organized to build the pyramids, humans organized to implement the Final Solution, and humans organized the revolt at Treblinka. I'm awestruck by their courage."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"Any disbeliever in the Holocaust needs to began their re-education by reading this unique book. This is the finest book on the dark side of human nature and man's inhumanity to man. This demonstrates what happens when the majority turns their heads and rationalizes that what is happening to their neighbors is not their concern. Not recommended for children, but I gave this to my 15 year old granddaughter who is doing a special project in high school on the Holocaust including a visit this summer to several death camps in Eastern Europe including Treblinka."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I couldn't go on reading this. Which isn't about the subject matter - I've seen quite a few films about the Holocaust, as well as about Germany and Poland before or after the war, & read some books already. It's just that the dialogue is so hackneyed - I don't know if that's how it was originally written, has to do with the translation, or both. I mean, a Readers Digest level of hackneyed. Which, given Simone De Beauvoir's preface, surprised me (I imagine she wanted to be supportive of the project as a whole).Also, the author purports to know how entire rooms and groups of people feel. Which would be okay if this were entirely fictional. But since this is at its heart a documentary text; or purports to at least encompass documentary, it doesn't work for me. Even if Steiner heard hundreds of first-hand accounts, it's still inaccurate by its very nature to say that \\"the entire room was fearful\\" or \\"the entire room was stunned,\\" especially if he wasn't there. On the other hand, he says things like \\"the Gentiles were stronger\\" as a partial explanation for lack of Jewish resistance to pogroms, etc. As that's part of the \\"character study,\\" so to speak, that he's laying out to explain the sociocultural milieu leading up to Jewish behavior around the Holocaust, I was confused & frustrated when he didn't explain that statement at all.As I read through the first few chapters - especially the section that attempts to replicate Pessia's story - I kept thinking, \\"They wouldn't say this in this way,\\" or \\"Just tell the story!\\" For instance, there are several examples of people saying that they are enduring abuse so that they can, later, tell their story. It doesn't feel right that these people would, relatively early on, and ignorant of the gas chambers, be already thinking about posterity. Since it's part of the book's theme, I suppose Steiner felt he had to start hammering the point home.I can tell that this would be a powerful story without the drawing-out, decoration, and occasionally confusing omissions that happen here. The subject's already rife with conflict and drama.Having recently re-immersed myself in Holocaust films & reading, I have a strong need to learn more about the fighters, resisters, and vindicators. I think that's the only way to find one's way out of the place to which deep exposure to the Holocaust's horrific events can take one. So I'm about to read several other books about uprisings, escapes, and resistance, including what happened at Treblinka. Also, for anyone who reads this & who can relate, I want to share that, years ago, I saw the film Weapons of the Spirit, which is about a French village of devout Huguenot Christians who saved 5,000 Jews. That documentary brought me to tears, & has helped bolster my faith in a higher form of goodness. In case you're interested, it's on Amazon - http://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Spirit-VHS-Pierre-Sauvage/dp/0967651204 - and there's a website."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"The following review is based on the original (1967) edition. The book begins with accounts of the mass shootings of Jews by the Germans at Ponary Woods near Vilnius (Wilno, Vilna).Common themes in this novel-like book are \\"Jewish passivity\\", affirmations and denials of faith in God, and preparations for the daring revolt. Steiner estimates that the bodies of the 700,000 murdered Treblinka Jews, prior to cremation, occupied 90,000 cubic yards and weighed 35,000 tons (p. 282). This means that the average body occupied 3.47 cubic feet and weighted 110.25 pounds.A major factor behind \\"Jewish passivity\\" had been the deeply-ingrained pro-German orientation of most Jews. Steiner comments: \\"Even more than Polish Jews, they [the German Jews] had still refused to accept the reality of extermination. On this subject Ringelblum noted in his journal that the first deportees from the Warsaw ghetto referred to Hitler as unser Fuhrer. This terrible blindness lasted to the threshold of the gas chambers.\\" (p. 164). Further east, the following was the attitude of Polish Jews living in a village near Bialystok: \\"At the beginning of the German occupation no one had been worried, and if it had not been for the obligation to wear a yellow star on the chest and the left shoulder, it would have been possible to believe that life would go on as it had in the past, with its great poverty, its small satisfactions, and the immense joy of Sabbath evenings.\\" (p. 195). The foregoing adds refutation to the claim that the massive Jewish-Communist collaboration, in Soviet-conquered eastern Poland, had been motivated by Jewish fears of Nazi extermination. It is obvious that, back in 1939-1940, few Polish Jews had such fears.Steiner touches on various issues related to prewar Polish-Jewish relations. She cites the experience of Adolf Friedman, who considered himself a \\"Pole of Mosaic persuasion\\": \\"He had belonged to that minority of middle-class Jews who had believed that assimilation was possible at the time of the Constitution of 1919, which made the Jews almost full-fledged citizens for the first time in the history of Poland.\\" (p. 102)Polish nationalists have at times accused Jews of shirking military service. Steiner confirms the validity of this accusation when she discusses its implication for the impending Treblinka revolt, albeit with the following spin: \\"...few Jews knew how to use a weapon. Treated as second-class citizens, massacred from time to time during pogroms, openly despised by all \`good Poles', most Jews had tried, often successfully, to avoid military service. The majority had no military training.\\" (p. 157). This also confirms the reason for relatively few Jews being admitted to the AK.Most Holocaust materials tacitly assume that Poles were responsible for most if not all of the killings of fugitive Jews, but Steiner doesn't. After suggesting that 40 of the Treblinka escapees survived until the arrival of the Red Army (historian Yitzhak Arad estimates 70), she comments: \\"The others had been killed in the course of that year by Polish peasants, partisans of the Armia Krajowa [AK], Ukrainian fascist bands, deserters from the Wehrmacht, the Gestapo, and special units of the German army.\\" (p. 335). In view of the fact that Germans and Ukrainians were incomparably more prone to kill Jews than were the Poles, this takes on further significance."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"To put it bluntly, this book is a hoax.The book itself claims to come \\"...as close to the facts as we are likely to come\\" (in the Introduction). Nothing could be farther away from the truth.Magazines and scholars (french and international) have denounced the book and the author plenty of times (Revue d'histoire de la Shoah, Gitta Sereny and others). Check out Gitta Sereny's brilliant \\"Into That Darkness: From Mercy Killing to Mass Murder\\" if you want facts"},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I have a morbid facsination with the Holocaust and Holocaust literature so I picked up Treblinka. I was not prepared for what was in it, how it would make me feel. I couldn't put it down. For two days I lived and breathed Treblinka, for two days I was beaten, starved, tortured, I saw my family gassed, I saw my fellow inmates hang themselves because death was better than this hell on earth. For two days I was an inmate of Treblinka because Jean-Francois Steiner put me there. Treblinka is quite possibly the most important piece of Holocaust literature ever written. It is non-fiction but it reads like a novel. It told me more about the death camps and Nazi regime than all of the books I have read combined. The most amazing thing about Treblinka though was the psychology behind it all. It gave answer to my question: Why did they not revolt before this? Why did they simply allow themselves to be led to death? On the third day I rose from the bottom of the abyss, I revolted, I left Treblinka along with 700 Jews, survivors of hell. I left but I didn't escape, no one escapes Treblinka. Like how Treblinka will always hold it's prisoners, Treblinka will always hold it's readers in it's mental grasp."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"A chance meeting with a university professor in NY years ago caused me to ask the question of what was it really, really like to exist in a place of complete insanity; where you were placed at risk of death at every moment, where every act, every gesture could be your last. What sort of social structure could possibly evolve in such indescrible conditions where inmate sometimes turned on inmate for a crust of bread. And yet in this dark chaos an order did evolve. The inmates organized themselves to such an extent that they ultimately rose up in rebellion, overpowering their opressors and a small number actually escaped.I have read numerous books on the Holocaust but none of those prepared me for Steiner's superb work. Many of the works I've read concerned Auschwitz. Frankly, I never focused on Treblinka. As there is a relatively large number of Auschwitz survivors, I suspect scholars tend to focus on them. As far as Treblinka survivors go... there were only 75. Steiner's descriptions are so overwhelming; his imagery so clear and lucid that you can see in your own mind, the acts of brutality and barbarism, as well as small acts of kindness as if you are actually there. I found myself cringing at the blows of the clubs and the slash of the whips. And yet he takes pains to describe acts of heroism one can hardly imagine. You see how exposure to this inhumanity affects the inmates. Some degenerate while others work at mostly futile individual escape attempts in order to warn the remaining Jews of what ultimately lies in wait at the railhead at Treblinka Station.This is strong stuff and is not for everyone. This is not a book that compiles statistics but rather paints a searing description of day-to-day life with the inmates, their struggles to make it another day, their planning and finally their courageous attempt to escape.If you make it through this book, read Kogon's &quot;The Theory and Practice of Hell&quot; and then the next time you see &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; taking place in some remote venue such as the Balkans, Rawanda or Timor ask yourself just how far we've really come and how easily we've learned to mouth the words &quot;never again&quot;."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"Treblinka is an incredible recreation of the human elements of the Holocaust. It portrays real, historical people who as innocent victims and against all odds, not only stayed alive but were able to organize a suicidal uprising, with the sole objective being the successful escape and survival of just One human being, in order to bear witness and testify to the hell and death of the infamous Treblinka. As a historian of the Holocaust I'm certain that this is the most important literary piece that one could find. This book will shock and infuriate you, but ultimately you will find it to be about hope and life. It is a must read for anyone who wants to be an additional witness to the most horrific chapter in the history of our world!

I have read a lot of literature on the Holocaust and yet am always amazed by it. This book takes it a step farther in understanding the meticuous perfection the Germans sought in exterminating a whole race of people. It is a book of triamph, but also shows in great detail how the German intentions could never be fulfilled because of a driving natural force within all of mankind to continue living. Not to live as individuals, but to fight in order to continue a whole lineage of people. It is beautifuly written and extremelly enlightening. I Thank Professor Schonfeld for requiring it, and you will thank me for reccomending it. Tricia Taft"},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"\\"Treblinka\\" is a powerful novel and a story of things that the Nazis wanted the world to never know. The novel spares nothing in the telling: every gruesome beating, coldhearted murder, inhuman cruelty is captured in shocking detail. I wanted to shed tears as I read this novel. There were so many poignant moments that made me breathless and contemplative of such a world.However, in the face of the Holocaust (Shoah) the real treasure are how these human slaves kept their humanity... making jokes in the face of genocide. One might think that it would be impossible to laugh when people are being thrown into ovens and turned into consumer goods for the Third Reich (human hair for pillows, rendering people into soap, some things even worse), but the downtrodden victims of Treblinka never gave up. They kept faith in life and living life (not just surviving) in the face of the most horrible death.I read about some of the humor of these condemned and it is a miracle in and of itself (Pg.238 \\"Treblinka,\\" 1967 Simon and Shuster Hardcover Edition):------------\\"Earlier, at the end of the ghetto period, when the best will in the world it had become impossible to preserve the slightest hope, some Jews had taken refuge in humor. The essential metaphysical question had become: \\"Do you believe in life after the trains?\\" The standard consolation to friends to whom you had to leave and whose sadness could be read on their faces had become, \\"\\"Come on, cheer up, old man, we'll meet again some day in a better world - in a shop window as soap.\\" If the friend was in the know, he was supposed to reply, \\"Yes, but while from my fat they'll make toilet soap, you'll be a bar of cheap laundry soap.\\"\\"To understand this humor is to understand the infinite love of life of the Jews. It is to understand both the abdication and the miracle.\\"-------------The book also functions as a history of how the \\"death camp\\" evolved in the Baltics from gun killings to Xyklon-B (poison gas) vans to the concentration camps that the Holocaust is better known for. Particularly discussed are the machinations of the SS and the \\"Technicians\\" to dehumanize the Jews and not only make them captives and victims, but willing accomplices in the process of committing genocide. The novel examines what it means to live while everyone around you dies (often including one's own family and children). The moral burden of such a situation is even difficult to just ponder yet alone have to survive.Another function of the novel is to disprove the myth of the concentration camp Jew as a meek helpless being to be pitied. The surviving Jews at Treblinka did stage a revolt and out of the eight hundred Jews (themselves the survivors of around eight-hundred-thousand Jews that the Nazis \\"processed\\" at the Treblinka) that the Nazis kept as menial labor at Treblinka, forty survived the war. Their testimonies in addition to the few books written about the subject after the war form the bulk of the research sources of \\"Treblinka.\\"Sometimes this book is criticized for being \\"fiction\\" since it isn't referenced like as academic tome (footnotes, bibliography, etc.), but the author is careful to explain in her introduction and the conclusion that apart from the survivors' testimonies and what little physical evidence could be found, there was little concrete evidence to be had. The Nazis were careful to destroy written records and even incinerated the bodies of their victims in an effort to hide this atrocity. I found the story to be very convincing and don't doubt the author's writing one iota.Probably the biggest reason to read \\"Treblinka\\" is that it's so very readable. Reading about the Holocaust can be an emotionally taxing task, but thanks to the author's easy-to-read and captivating style as well as a focus on the hope that sustained the survivors of Treblinka, \\"Treblinka\\" is an easy and enjoyable read. Out of all the novels that I've read about the Holocaust I've read, I would now recommend \\"Treblinka\\" to start a study of the Holocaust. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"I read Treblinka in 3 different languages, the most recent in Portuguese. I read it for the first time in Spanish when I was 12 and later in English when I moved to Canada.In Treblinka all evil gathered.This is a majestic piece of literature, quasi-historic, If you care to look at perhaps one of the most important events in the history of humankind. Never mind that it contains some reputed historic inaccuracies, Steiner does a genuine job at recreating every moment with sincerity. He's not looking at changing history, his impetus is to relay an important message.Treblinka is the true manifestation of evil. Man at its worst, relishing pleasure at the expense and suffering of other men.The book is not really about the camps, despite its obvious content. The history is about an age-old struggle, the struggle between good and evil.If that's a concept that perhaps you have not yet understood, consider yourselves lucky.Treblinka leaves many questions. How could man behave with such great cruelty and disregard for the lives of others.You are in the trains, in the barracks, in the divinding lines marching towards the \\"showers.\\"You are a son, a mother, a doctor, a girl undressing for the first time in front of your executioners and your friends.

Remember Treblinka. I can always comeback and fight, even in the heart of the worst situations.Treblinka leads towards the understanding of suffering, evil, and God.Adhering to hope and God, in the face of evil, Treblinka is a message that must be understood.

This is the story of the building of the camp, its operation, the prisoners revolt and the destruction of the camp. The story is told from the viewpoint of the prisoners who operated the camp under the rule of the SS and Ukrainian guards. About 700 prisoners survived the revolt and escaped. Less than 75 were alive to be interviewed by the author. These interviews plus the testimony given at the various tribunals and Nazi records are interwoven into a narrative that leaves the reader stunned by its detail"},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"This is a good novel, in the strictest sense. I understand it was written in the 60s, probably before or after the Treblinka trials of the 60s, but there are many inaccuracies in this book, something that has also been said by survivors like Richard Glazar and even former SS man Franz Suchomel. Ive studied this particular area of the holocaust, that is, the Operation Reinhard camps, for many years, as there is still little info o the subject, especially compared with Auschwitz/Birkenau. SS men Kurt Franz (nicknamed Lalka, meaning Doll in Polish) and Kuttner, nicknamed Kiwe by the inmates of Treblinka, are the main SS men in the story. But it wasnt Kuttner that got the name of the Angel Of Death, that was reserved for August Miete of the SS. The book does mention, of course, the murder of SS man Max Biala by a prisoner named Berliner. The book, as a novel, is good in and of itself, i just wish these novelists didnt feel the need to make up things when the truth was just as shocking, if not more shocking. I could give many examples but it would take too long. It seems the author of this book kind of had composite characters of the SS, such as calling Kuttner the Angel Of Death when that was not the case, though Kuttner was terrible in his own right. There is no mention of SS men like Hirthreiter, Willi Mentz (the gunman of Treblinka who often worked in the \\"filed hospital\\" of the camp, where some new arrivals and prisoners themselved would be shot above a pit that was almost kept lit with the help of sulfur and similar things. If you want the best accounts of the Treblinka experience, i recommend Richard Glazar's book \\"Trap With a Green Fence\\" and Samuel Willenburg's account titled \\"Surviving Treblinka\\", and the book Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, published by Indiana University. There is also the book \\"The Death Camp Treblinka\\" by Alexander Donat, which has many firsthand accounts of what when on in that place of carnage. It is not the easiest book to find, i foind it at a library years ago and i just found a copy on here that was going for nearly 200 dollars, but i will get it as soon as i get the funds. Anyway, this is a good NOVEL, as we dont know many of the dialogues that took place in the camp during lights out after a day of sorting clothes and witnessing innocents being chased down the \\"Road to Heaven\\", the fenced path that led to the building containing the gas chambers which were equipped with carbon monoxide to brutally murder those shoved in the chambers...i guess i could recommend this book, as it is good in and of itself as a novel, but there are way too many inaccracies when looking at it from a historical point of view as I do. Perhaps worst of all was the misrepresentation of some of those who perished in the camp, and who have no way of defending themselves. Get Glazar's Trap With A Green Fence and Willenburg's Surviving Treblinka, then get even more deep with books like Donat's \\"The Death Camp Treblinka\\". And Gitta Sereny's book \\"Into that Darkness\\", featuring interviews from survivors and former SS men in treblinka, most notably Franz Stangl and Franz Suchomel, and the interviews play off each other, just to confirm things that may or may not have happened in Treblinka, especially with things that these individual SS men had done or not done. But this novel Treblinka is good, i suppose, for beginners to get an understanding of the place, but there are more and better accounts of what REALLY happened in Treblinka...so there is my 2 cents. But just remember that some survivors were offended by this book, as if it were manipulated a bit. But, nonetheless, it is a good read, and once you research other aspects, you can yourself correct the inaccuricies of this book should you read it again, as I have done."},{"Title":"Treblinka","review":"Reading this book was an amazing emotional experience. It not only addresses the realities of the Jews' suffering, but also uncovers in wonderful depth the moral and philosophical issues involved in their plight-- the denial of the death camps, the question of resistance, methods of survival and coping.

First came \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\\" in 1912, which established Stephen Leacock as Canada's leading humorist. Leacock wrote about various individuals in Orillia, but he took pains to point out that his \\"Mariposa\\" was typical of many small towns. Richmond emphasizes \\"the civic spirit\\" that inspires and shapes a community. For example, it was no accident that Orillia was the first community in the Americas to adopt Daylight Saving Time.If it was progressive, new and scientific in 1912, Orillia was for it. Mayor \\"Daylight Bill\\" Frost, whose son Leslie Frost was Prime Minister of Ontario in the 1950's, vigorously promoted the new idea for \\"The Town Ahead.\\" It prompted the inevitable laughs, \\"Do you go on God's Time or Bill Frost's time?\\" As still happens to countless people, when the \\"Leap Ahead\\" day came, Daylight Bill forgot to set his clock ahead and got church an hour late the next morning. The idea soon collapsed in chaos -- but, it became a national policy during World War I.Orillia became a leading town in many ways. It pioneered the long-distance transmission of electric power, produced Tudhope Automobiles until the outbreak of war in 1914, erected one of the world's finest statues of the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, and helped begin the Canadian tradition of humor with one of the finest comedy troupes that entertained troops during the war. One of the world's first health insurance plans began in Orillia; and the Soldier's Memorial Hospital was built to provide perpetual free medical care for every Orillia area veteran. The list goes on and on.Richmond looks at \\"why\\" it all happened. It's what he calls \\"the Orillia Spirit,\\" which has ebbed and flowed for the past 125 years. Orillia collapsed in the 1920's and by the 1950's, wages were among the lowest in the province. When Thomson Newspapers bought the local weekly in the 1940's, the staff trembled at the new owner's tight-fisted reputation for wages. Thomson insisted everyone had to accept Thomson wage scales, or look elsewhere. The result was about a 25 percent wage increase for most employees. By the 1950's, \\"new ideas\\" centered on visitors who could make clouds \\"disappear\\" through mental power alone. By 1962, preparing Orillia's (and Canada's) Centennial in 1967, town officials tore down the original brick and limestone village meeting hall that had been built in 1867.As happens with many failing towns, the attitude \\"do as Daddy did\\" was considered enough to restore prosperity. It's all here; the brilliance and cooperation that creates an outstanding community or company, plus the bickering, infighting and pettiness that brings collapse. The incidents in the \\"Orillia Spirit\\" will remind anyone of similar faults or greatness in their own situation; once such folly is recognized, it is much easier to confront and correct or flee and forget. All this is woven into a well written account of how a small town with a Spanish name grew, thrived, failed, and is still bickering into the 1990's.In so doing, Richmond avoids the pitfalls of most \\"local\\" history. His writing is fresh, comfortable, clear and informative. I know, I started an Orillia history in the 1960's and had I stayed would have produced a dense, dull, detailed and unreadable manuscript. Richmond made none of those mistakes, which makes his book a fascinating story of a small town and a perfect example for anyone interested in writing a history of their town or company."},{"Title":"The Funny Money Game","review":"Interesting book, yet the damage done to one of the CPAs (Anthony M.

This book opened up my perspectives and understanding in dozens of new ways. Brought my acting up many levels in depth and made me aware of many acting tools that I had been underutilizing. Loved how he got into the head of actor - and this many years later, how many of my thoughts matched that of his students. Appreciated how he dissected those thoughts and subsequent acting exercises to pull the mental curtains open a foot each time I read a new chapter. The incremental exposure to the psychology of a character and infusion of truthful acting helped me understand, probably for the first time, how much goes into the craft of acting.

He's not theorizing, he's discovered The Organic Truth Of The Universe, etc. All this dogmatising is forgivable when one realizes it's the outpouring of a Slavic soul, but it does tend to eclipse the fact that his system is--stripped of all the hyperbole--based upon, of all things, logic.What's the objective? OK, play that.Or if you wish a more detailed dissertation: To [...] with what you're feeling. Play the objective.Otherwise you may weep and rave about but fail to find the brooch pinned to the curtain, like the student actress in this book.Now does it work? Well, if you have faith in it. . .The progression (some would say the degeneration) of Stanislavski in the US goes something like this: Charles Conrad (who taught for Meisner and never wrote anything, his is the Zen-style of Stanislavski) to Sandford Meisner (who taught for Strasberg and wrote an unintelligible book but who is much admired for getting method actors off their introspective derrieres and on their feet) Lee Strasberg who, unlike Stella Adler never met The Master himself, so felt free to um.. theorize even further, and Michael Checkhov, (the only great actor of the bunch who Stan considered his best student even though he rejected the system) whose mystical ideas are floating somewhere in the stratosphere.Strasberg, by far the most influential, founded Method Acting (not to be confused with the Stanislavski System or 'The Method of Physical Action ' a short treatise in Creating a Role which emphasized remembered memory a.k.a. emotional memory which at times superseded the objective by demanding a Pavlovian type of identification/ connection which would ensure real tears.In away he set theater back to before 'finding the brooch'Later, Stanislavski himself rejected the emotional memory/pavlovian experiment after many of his actors started freaking out..The main moral of an Actor Prepares is that if you're going to write a world changing treatise on acting, it helps if you've got a genius playwright like Michael's uncle whose plays you can produce.The second is to play the--oops said that already.May I also humbly recommend Mike Green's 'The Art of Coarse Acting' Shurtleff's 'Audition' Keith Johnstone's 'Impro' and Klaus Kinski's bio, for a sense of, if not sanity, at least a healthy dose of skeptical heresy?"},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"The good old Stanislavski. This is one of the more traditional books, read by just about every professional actor. However it is damaging to todays actor. If you are in film, this book is not for you. Most of the exercises can not adequately be applied to Film acting. One reason is because a film actors life is very busy. He/she does not have the time to spend on any one of these exercises described in this book. If, however, you are a Stage actor, this book could prove beneficial. The exercises are intended for the stage and work well in rehearsal environments. However, I would speculate, like most acting schools, this book gives one too many exercises and not enough emphasis on how to study a scene. This is a common mistake found in most theatrical studies. If you would be interested to hear more explanations as to my opinion, I recommend &quot;True and False,&quot; by David Mamet. He will explain better than I can the negative results of this book. This book was intended for its time (I believe late 18th century) and unlike Shakespeare, cannot be applied to much of the acting styles used today."},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"The first in a series of three, an Actor Prepares deals with the inner process/preparation an actor must explore in order to prepare for a role, how to control and stimulate your mind in order to convey the truth of your character. The story is told through the eyes of Kostya, the ex-stenographer who know shorthand, thus enabling him to take notes of the class. The instructor, Tortsov, is Stanislavski in disguise.The book takes you on a journey of the art - acting. From learning about the magic \\"IF\\" to learning how to find your super-objective there is something for all in this book. Everything interrelates forming a web of knowledge and tools that you can take with you forever.When you read it, however, keep in mind what the author said about his books:\\"It is not a hand-me-down suit that you can put on and walk off in; or a cook book where all you need to find is the page and there is your recipe. No, it is a whole way of life.\\""},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"An Actor's Prepares is a teaching book that is written as a story. The theory is within the story. The &quot;story&quot; touches on things like relaxation, movement and concentration. You are one of the students, you learn the same method as the other students in the story. You will progress with them and in the end, you will have the sense on being &quot;private in public&quot;. If you are an actor, or thinking of pursuing a career as an actor, this is a MUST READ! I still use this bokk as a guide to get me back on track when I feel that I am slipping in my craft. I love this book because of the way Stanislavski is preserved here. His teaching style shines through. This is the first book in a trilogy of the Stanislavski &quot;Method&quot; My advise for reading this book. Read it slow and digest every individual thought as if it were your last meal. You will learn not only about improving your ability to act, but also come away with a better feeling of who you are as a person, not just as an actor!"},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"It cannot be doubted that Stanislavki's Trilogy is a must for any aspiring actor. Stanislavki was the pioneer in creating a coherent system of practices and concepts to aid in strengthening the art of acting. I would, however, advise anyone who has not yet read the book to be cautious. It is important to understand that Hapgood's translation is sketchy in places, and tends to run around in cirlcles. As a supplement to this book, I would recommend reading Sonia Moore's The Stanislavski System. She worked directly with Stanislavski and understands his system much better than E. Hapgood. Not that the books vagueness is all her fault. It seems that Stanislavki goes to great lengths to explain things that are, nowadays, common sense. He certainly wasn't the first to ever think of these concepts; he was merely the first to organize them and give them names. Much of what is contained in this book is merely a modernized translation of Hamlet's &quot;Speak the speech I pray you&quot;. The Magic If is simply a codefied means of make believe. That is fundamentally what it all boils down to. I relished the situation of the student and teacher realationship, and did find myself growing and evolving with him. It really makes you think of acting in a whole new perspective. But, as with any method, you must be cautious to use only what works for you. There is a common desire to make An Actor Prepares the bible of all actors. I won't argue that Stanislavski's system is the basis of almost all other methods that have risen in the last century, but there are other effective texts available. Respect of Acting and To the Actor, to name a couple. Don't just read Stanislavski; read several to help put it all in perspective. Acting books are so pompous, byenlarge, and you have to wade through a lot of self-hype and nonsense. That is one thing I really appreciated about his trilogy; they are without ego. Also, for anyone interested in a truly off the wall acting text, read The Inner Game of Tennis. It's literally found in the Sports section, but it's teachings are every bit as relevant to the art of acting as they are to sport psychology. Take my word for it. And the best thing about it is that you don't have to listen to any snooty actors talking about how great they are."},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"Stanislavski is a familiar name in theatre circles. The legendary director of the Moscow Art Theatre wrote perhaps some of the most influential books on acting in the last century. I could list the big names who cite his influence (most famously, Marlon Brando and Sir John Gielgud), but the fact is his teachings have become so much a part of the way we approach theatre, that almost any actor in the English-speaking world (and abroad) can claim at least some influence.Elizabeth Hapgood's translation of Stanislavski's work (featured on this page) remains the most widely circulated among English speakers. Unfortunately, it is also highly problematic. By publishing her translations as two separate books \\"An Actor Prepares\\" and \\"Building a Character\\", Hapgood unintentionally misrepresented Stanislavski's original intentions. In actuality, \\"An Actor Prepares\\" and \\"Building a Character\\" were both written as two parts of a single book, called \\"An Actor's Work on Himself.\\"Hapgood had worked with Stanislavski on an early version of Part One. However, Stanislavski continued to revise his manuscript even after Hapgood had returned home to America. What would eventually be published as \\"An Actor Prepares\\" was actually a much-abridged version of what she received from Stanislavski. Not only that, but it is missing Stanislavski's subsequent revisions.The translation itself is especially difficult to get through. The diction is quaint and Victorian and brings to mind Constance Garrett's dowdy translations of Dostoevsky. What's more is that Stanislavski's sense of humor is largely censored, in favor of contriving a more flowing narrative. While this is understandable, this drastically alters the reader's understanding of Stanislavski's system. The original featured more dialogue among the students to flesh out the concepts in better detail.To read a modern translation of Stanislavski's work in its complete form, check out Jean Benedetti's excellentAn Actor's Work. Up until the publication of Benedetti's book, I would have been perfectly content to recommend the Hapgood version. But the release of the new translation, which is both more readable and truer to Stanislavski's intentions, now fully highlights how impoverished this edition actually is."},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"This book is an absolute MUST READ for all actors. I am convinced that no-one should be allowed on stage until they have read this book.Stanislavski's ideas form the basis of most modern acting techniques, as well they should. Before I studied Stanislavski, I had always felt there was something lacking in my acting and could never quite figure out what; I discovered it when I studied Stanislavski.My one complaint is that the translation is bad. The translator was NOT an actor, and many cuts were made to the original text. This has resulted in many confusions about what Stanislavski actually said."},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"I found &quot;An Actor Prepares&quot; to be a deeply rewarding read, and I found its message applicable to all of the arts. Opening a window to a time and place where great strides were made in the modern theater, we join a fictionalized group of students awaiting their first lesson with the great master &quot;Tortsov&quot; (really Stanislavski.) I simply drank in Constantin Stanislavski's wisdom, enjoyed his consummate readability, and shivered in amazement that he was able to advance the philosophy and praxis of acting to such heights at the time that he wrote - he lived from 1863 to 1938. I'm currently inhaling the second volume in this series: &quot;Building A Character.&quot; I fully intend round out my reading with some Strasberg, Meisner etc. after I finish Stanislavski's trilogy, but at this moment I am quite content to be able to gaze back in time to the Moscow Art Company, and imagine that I'm there amid the heady acting sessions of these books. Although trailblazers and pioneers in any art or science rarely leave a perfectly polished jewel as their legacy, it is a great mistake to pass over their immense contributions.

If you want to be an actor or actress then all you have to do is read this book, and you're there. This book covers every possible technique you will ever need on the stage! Stanislavski takes on the role as a teacher for his students in this book, but the fact is that he is both the actors and the teacher. He uses the students to ask the questions you are wondering about, and answers them as the teacher. His discriptions are so good that you sometimes wonder if you are really there. The only thing that makes you sure is that he can't give you feedback on your efforts at home. But apart from that it is just like having a very knowledgable teacher of your own, that can answer all the questions you have about acting, and then some. It is an awesome book. A must have for everyone!"},{"Title":"An Actor Prepares","review":"An Actor Prepares by Constantine Stanislavski is a great read.

What I didn't like was what Francie's trainer did and got away with and that Francie's dad acted like it was acceptable.A couple more things that really annoyed me was that the story would be going along then suddenly it was the next day and there was no page break or other indication that was going to happen.

The most interesting story line was the relationship of the wealthy riders and coaches with the Latino grooms.

On the way, she must do some serious reevaluating of herself, her riding career and her future goals.What I liked is that many cliches were sidestepped.

While there wasn't a lot of suspense built up (no nail-biting, 'who will win'?! moments), that didn't detract from the interest of the story, and I liked the fact that the ending wasn't predictable. I also like the way Francie has to come to terms with the discovery that her trainer and idol really isn't the man she believed he was.Overall, this book is well-written, interesting, and would appeal to all riders, and even most teen girls who just like horses. I just wish they'd change the cover, it's quite awful."},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"Francie Martinez is a groom at West Hills, one of the best places to train in the country. She's also a rider, but the distinction is her father is the West Hills barn manager, with absolutely no money to pay for the kind of training one needs to make it to the Maclay Finals and onward to Grand Prix. Francie is good, but she's not as good as Tara, the great West Hills hope for their trainer, Rob. Rob is the equestrian version of God, and Francie spends most of her lessons scrambling for his attention the way he lavishes it on Tara.It's pretty apparent straight off that Francie isn't exactly comfortable in her skin. Literally and figuratively. She's half Mexican, and she bluntly points out that there are no Hispanic riders in America. To make matters worse, there's the obvious distinction between groom and rider. Francie isn't a working student, and whenever she tries to break out of her confines to interact with Colby (who is gorgeous and funny and rich and a good rider in his own right) her father slaps her down because he's been there and done that with her nonexistent mother, and look where that wound up. She's having a hard time balancing being both groom and rider, and people like Tara make the distinction obvious whenever they can.Then there's school. Francie is a public school kid, whereas the other kids at West Hills are either privately tutored (her best friend, Katie, and Colby) or they dropped out to focus on riding (Tara). But even at school, Francie has a hard time fitting in. She's always focused on riding and school work, therefore she's not around, leaving her very existence mostly a mystery to the rest of the local kids. This leaves Francie as eager to please, and a basket case when she's put on the spot. It's shocking she can handle the ordeals of a normal day, much less the pressures of a show.Despite these things, it's obvious that Francie is a good rider, and she's justified in dreaming of beating Tara in the Maclay Finals. But the book is more than this. Unlike just about every other book involving girls, horses, show jumping, and the mention of Olympic dreams, it doesn't end like you expect, and it manages to hit a completely different note than the scores of other books that have meagerly tried and miserably failed at the same point. It makes the kind of note that doesn't blatantly say: it doesn't matter what personal growth this character makes because she's going to win anyway because she's irritatingly perfect and you can be too!All I can say at this point is to go find it and read it. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"Kim Ablon Whitney's novel, The Perfect Distance follows Francie Martinez, a young Mexican-American woman on her way to the Maclay Finals (the granddaddy of all junior equestrian eventing). Francie trains at the same farm where she is also a groom resulting in prejudice behavior from her barn mates. Through life altering relationships and events Francie discovers that all she needs to win the Finals is confidence.Having been a competitor at the Maclay Finals, Whitney is able to use personal knowledge to project the stresses of competing to the readers. Whitney explains all the horse jargon, but does it in a way that the novel does not read like a textbook or dictionary. The topics of sex, alcohol, and bulimia are addressed in the novel making it better suited for a more mature audience. Having said that, the vocabulary could be beefed up a little to accommodate an older age group. Being an avid rider, I can say that Whitney's novel is a true-to-life documentation of the struggles riders face while trying to compete and maintain a 2.5 grade point average.[...]"},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"The Perfect Distance is not your average girl-loves-horses book. In fact, horses are really secondary here in this story of a girl growing up and finding herself. Francie has been around horses pretty much her entire life. Her father, who is Mexican, works as a stable manager for West Hills...which happens to be run by one of the best equestrian trainers in the business.Francie works as a groom to help pay for her lessons with Rob, the rather ill-tempered trainer. That separates her from the other students, who are mostly rich kids, as does the fact that she is half-Mexican (though this makes more of a difference in Francie's mind than to most of the other riders). Francie is a good, solid rider, but Rob pays her little attention, instead concentrating on the spoiled Tara.When Colby, a new rich but not-at-all-spoiled kid comes to train, Francie is confused. She wavers between being ashamed of her heritage and being proud of all her father has accomplished. She doesn't tell Colby at first that she's also a groom and not just another student, until Tara (i.e. the spoiled rotten) outs her.In the meantime, they are all on edge as the finals approach. Who will make it? Who won't? Will Katie, Francie's good friend and fellow student, snatch up Colby or will Francie make a move, even though her father doesn't approve?Add in some family conflict as well, as Francie's dad is determined that she go to college, even though she'd rather just ride and you've got a lot cooking in this plot. And then there's Rob...will he stoop to new lows to get what he wants?This is a good, solid story from a writer that seems to specialize in conflicted girls growing up (Whitney also wrote See You Down the Road). Francie's troubles are real and heartfelt and the reader will root for her, even when they can see that she's making mistakes. Recommended for readers aged 12 and up.Kimberly Pauley, YA Books Goddess @ YABooksCentral.com"},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"Except for starting out shaky and dropping some of the plot points so agonizingly built up, this book was pretty good. Rob, the trainer, was so realistic (and horrible) I was reminded of all the reasons I hesitate to compete: the lack of respect of and thought for the horse and its wellbeing, the verbal and emotional abuse that so many riders put themselves through just to be \\"the best,\\" and the snobbishness and racism that are such a prominent part of the horse industry."},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"This book was wholly satisfying in a way that many \\"horse books\\" can't seem to reach.Essentially, it all comes down to Francie - a horse loving 17 year old whose father is the groom at the elite West Hills Stable - her friend Katie - who is rich and can't get over the fact that Francie is poorer and a better rider - and the new boy, Colby - who is \\"amazing\\" and likes Francie, not Katie.I was pleased that this book avoided some cliches like Francie actually winning, or Colby staying back at the farms for her, or Katie magically getting over herself, or Rob getting due punishment for his outrageous behavoir. Thankfully, none of these things happened.However, I was slightly disappointed that the author had to drag in the most cliched horse-book cliche in the history of equine fiction: insurance fraud. Many, many horse books seem to dance around this subject.I highly recommend this book to anyone - the author did a fantastic job at realism! If you aren't too nerdy with all the technical show jumping terms, don't be afraid - it won't prevent you from enjoying this outstanding novel."},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"I absolutely loved The Perfect Distance... I read it in one sitting! It covered the world of high-level junior competition surprisingly well. The only thing it didn't have going for it was that main charachter Francie didn't have a very strong relationship with her horse; but I also know that not many show circuit riders have a deep bond with their steeds.Apart from that one small thing, I found Ablon Whitney's work to be a masterpeice. This is a must-read for horsey teens!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Distance: A Novel","review":"I loved this book! As an aspiring equitation rider hoping to do the \\"big eq's\\", or major junior riding competitions, this book gave some great insight into all the hard work involved in riding at the nation's highest levels. The storyline was fun and interesting, and the details about the horses were correct because they were actualy written by a rider, which is hard to come by. Overall, I loved it!"},{"Title":"Canadian cook book","review":"I entered amazon.ca to try to find a replacement for my battered, worn and much-used copy of Nellie Lyle Pattison's Canadian Cook Book. I received my original copy as a Wedding present in 1969 and it has been used almost every day since then!What sets this cookbook apart? First, It gives _all_ the most essential basic information about selecting, handling and cooking every kind of food. No, not quite everything, because it's quite short on info for vegetarians.Second, it gives background information so the cook really understands what s/he is doing. For instance, it tells the cook what each ingredient in bread does for the success of the whole and even suggests 'safe' substitutions. It tells the advantages and disadvantages of each type of leavening agent and the different types of flour.Third, after every basic recipe you will find a set of variations to try out.The tone is a bit old-fashioned and even 'preachy', but I find that the charm of the thing - after all it _was_ originally written in 1923!As the title of this review states: This is _my_ essential cooking resource (this evening it's teaching me how to cook a duck I was given) and I sure hope amazon.ca can find me one!"},{"Title":"Truth About Kent State: A Challenge to the American Conscience","review":"I have purchased the THE TRUTH ABOUT KENT STATE...by Peter Daviesmany years ago. I have repurchased it recently for future historical purposes. His research into the probable cause of the Ohio National Guard's shooting involved the discharge of a .38 caliber handgun which was illegally permitted to be carried by a FBI (and Campus Police) informer photographer.The student informant intially confessed to shooting in presence of the WKYC television crew and the PR Officer of the National Guard while explaining his threatened situation to Campus Police. Several other witnesses heard and or saw this action, but whose testimonies were either ignored or concealed by the FBI. Peter Davies captured the main thrust of this, but since the National Guard testimonies as to hearing the \\"sniper\\" fire near the pines (prior to their firing where four students were killed and nine wounded) - were either concealed or silenced.As a result of the \\"controlled\\" presentation to the GrandJury and subsequent Scranton Commission - the Truth About KentState is still waiting for release and resolution.Although Peter Davies book is no doubt the most accurate andinformative work on the subject, after nearly 40 years of continued concealment and denials of evidence in this cae - perhaps the only avenue to remove the false blame of this tragedy from the Ohio National Guard and the students of KentState University = is via a Presidential order or an Act of Congress. (When the FBI causes a felony action, investigates andconceal it and passes judgement of guilt via the media and controls the information and evidence reviewed by Judicial entities --- you have what is called a stacked deck. Mr. Daviesbook recreates the truth behind this National Tragedy. I recommend this book highly for its investigation in pursuit oftruth and justice. Unless the book is reprinted - it may be hardto find. (Should be required reading in Civics classes)"},{"Title":"Truth About Kent State: A Challenge to the American Conscience","review":"This book provides the most comprehensive compliation of facts and evidence, providing photographs and eyewitness accounts that lead to an unmistakable, inescapable conclusion: The actions of the Ohio National Guard on May 4, 1970 were completely unprovoked.Unfortunately, those responsible for what could only be called a deliberate, criminal act were never prosecuted. After reading this, I strongly suggest you pick up The Kent State Coverup and read the rest of the story on how individuals within the Ohio National Guard literally got away with murder."},{"Title":"Australia Fair","review":"It's a crying shame that this book hasn't received more publicity than it has. I am not given to praising books with old cliches or empty catch-phrases; but I mean it when I say that this book needs to be inserted in the brief case of every politician worth his or her pension package. It offers a sensible way forward for Australia, with suggestions and practical economic advice that Australia's leaders, for the most part, aren't even coming close to guessing for themselves (if we can judge by their performance).This book is a political education in itself. Its lessons and guiding spirit must be the possession of every fair-minded, serious and conscience-respecting politician holding office, especially if Australia is to remain a country worth living in. We have already gone so far down the wrong path; this book shows us how to get back on track."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We purchased this book at the recommendation of friends. Our little guy is a newbie and my husband has pretty much gotten down all of the techniques. Not sure what to think about the missing \\"fourth trimester\\" theory, but the soothing techniques seem to work overall. Our boy thinks he doesn't like to be swaddled as he would much rather have his arms free, but swaddling does seem to put him to sleep faster. We have not read Baby Wise and we're new parents, but this book has definitely helped by giving us a starting point. Worth the read."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We are new parents, and this saved us. We actually had the book and the movie, and I recommend the movie. You may not have time to read another book. It tells his 5 methods for soothing a baby, and they seriously work like a charm! Whenever our baby fussed, we would do a few of them and instantly our baby would calm. It was amazing! And he explains certain details that help you understand why or just how to do it precisely the way your baby will like it. However, after about 6 weeks the effects start wear off (they are soothing because they remind baby of being in the womb), and one by one they aren't as full proof as they used to be. But still helpful at times. I would definitely recommend - this really helps you understand and calm your newborn!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is pure gold.

As she recited portions of the book, I nodded in agreement (I only look dumb. It minimizes my workload). She's happy therefore, I'm happy. The information contained within is sound and has provided us with a good foundation before the actual chaotic explosion of poopin' and crying begins.

That was the only explanation for her crabbiness and incessant crying. The doctor said colic, and my friends suggested this book. The next day, when Lily started in on me, I swaddled her up, turned her on her side and bounced on an exercise ball while shh-ing her. Within minutes she was quiet and a few minutes after that she was asleep. I was amazed, as was my mother in law. Her attitude has completely turned around in only a week.

Dr. Karp has tapped into the best of what we know in modern medicine and what we should heed from other cultures and other times. I wish I'd used these techniques with my two older children. Read it before you head to Labor &amp; Delivery, then keep it on hand for the weeks to come."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is an absolute must for parents of newborns. The techniques that I learned in the book completely changed my parenting experience. Before applying Dr. Karp's techniques I was crazy from the fatigue and the stress that comes from caring for a baby who cries all of the time and doesn't sleep. This book has given me new tools in caring for my son. He is now happy,peacful, and sleeps all of the time. I can now really enjoy being a mom. This is a must read for all new moms!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book having a fussy baby.. I received it when he 6 weeks old and having a fussy baby I didn't get to read it all until he was 8 weeks old between all the fluff and useless information Dr. Karp needed to add. What I don't understand is why this book wasn't done in 5-10 pages..because that's all that would have been needed. This didn't work for my son at all who hates being swaddled and yes I have tried it repeatedly, using his techniques, I even had my husband read it to make sure we were doing it right. Dr. Karp also really makes it seem as if it is our fault he doesn't like being swaddled and that EVERY baby does and he doesn't know. But our son is already rolling over at 2 months old and he was smiling at 3 weeks old, so I think he knows somewhat what is comfortable and what is not..I would have rated this book higher if the issue was that it didn't apply to our child.. but the part that was more frustrating was all the useless writing and fluff he needed to add in. It was a waste of time and money, neither of which I feel like wasting lately."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was disappointed in this book. All it has to offer are the 5 s's which don't take up a whole book to understand. Additionally, if you've taken a child birth class you were most likely taught the 5 s's. Not worth the money. Very wordy and low on information."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am pregnant with my first, and as I mentioned in the title of this review, I don't buy all of Dr. Karp's theories, especially about evolution, and that babies are now born three months earlier than they used to. It's somewhat plausible, and an okay explanation for why some babies are colicky, but as a first-time parent, I don't really care. What I care about is knowing some practical things for dealing with a fussy baby. I bought the book mainly to prepare myself now for \\"what if\\" rather than having to deal with an extremely fussy or colicky baby when I'm sleep deprived. I have also been a nanny for two different families, and I'm very familiar with fussy babies... but this time I won't be able to go home at the end of the day! I rated this book four out of five stars because I think it's WAY too long. I think Dr. Karp's five steps to calming a colicky baby can be adequately explained in ten pages, not 260. Or, in the very least, subsequent editions should have a pull-out laminated guide or something, because I can't imagine trying to root through the book to figure out the gist of his message while holding a screaming baby! Also, please note that this book is really only helpful for babies under 4 months old."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I check ALL baby books out before I buy &amp; on this one I was glad I did. All I needed to do is read it once. The tips were simple, and I hoped effective.For my son, this stuff simply didn't work. He HATED being swaddled. He HATED being on his tummy. Luckily, he was not a really fussy baby, even though he had reflux. Dr. Sears Baby Book had more info on his actual condition, and covered most of the main points of this book too.In all, not a bad book, but I don't think it is worth owning."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My wife and I recently entered the world of the sleep deprived with the birth of our son. Thankfully those days are already almost behind us due to the recent publication of a few books, Dr. Karp's and the No Cry Sleep Solution, by Elizabeth Pantley. We own both, and while both are good, personally we prefer the No Cry Sleep Solution. Perhaps its the fact that the book is written by a mother of four and parent educator, not a doctor. Her approach and writing style make you rightfully feel as though you're being taught by a learned friend who wants nothing more than to see you and your baby healthy, happy, and above all, rested. The Happiest Baby was useful, but it simply didn't grab us the same way. As an analogy, No Cry is like taking a stain from shirt with the advice from the Queen of Clean, as opposed to the head of the New York Department of Sanitation. On a completely different matter, almost every customer book review here originates from Santa Monica or LA, where Dr. Karp resides and practices. I think that is a little too coincidental."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"There is a lot of hype over this movie. Don't get my wrong, the information is helpful, but definitely not worth $10. The Happiest Baby on the Block talks about the 1st three months of a baby's life as being kind of like the '4th trimester'. Don't expect to much out of them and try to create womb-like environments for them. Swaddle them, swing them, shush them, play white noise. Mostly stuff that you would do anyway with a baby. His techqniques for holding, swaddling, and rocking are worth seeing once, but you definitely don't have to buy the movie. Borrow from a friend or just ask someone about it. I received this Dvd as a gift and then re-gifted it because there is no reason to ever watch it more than once. There is definitely some nice information in this video but I never had some kind of sacred, \\"my baby calms down instantly\\" experience. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It really just depends on your baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The Happiest Baby on the Block is something that I read while pregnant to get tips on what to do once the crying begins. I hear from girlfriends that this advice is actually excellent, so rather than just watch the video, I decided to read the book. Maybe not actually a great choice...The author comes across as pedantic and arrogant. I choose to believe that he has reason to feel so strongly about his miraculous calming skills (that's why he has written the book and started the 5 S's movement, after all, right?!), but found it hard to read, precisely because of this style. I am sure the advice will turn out to be right on, however, and I appreciated the in-depth look at why babies cry and how different cultures handle their infants.

So yes, I recommend this book. I DO NOT however recommend his similarly titled book for toddlers! His expertise clearly stays in the realm of infants.Buy this book, but don't waste your money on the second. I guess he and/or his publisher assumed (and were probably right) that most people would automatically buy both books since they seem to 'go together' ... sadly, the advice in the second is nowhere near helpful (unless of course you think it's acceptable to lock your child in his/her room, teach them bad habits like gossiping, and lie to them so they learn not to trust you!

Good luck!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was a life saver. Dr. Karp's 5 S strategy has worked every time my newborn son gets worked up. When he's really ramped up, it takes all 5 S's; but if he's only mildly fussy, maybe just one or two is all it takes to calm him and keep him happy.My advice to new parents is to read this BEFORE the baby is born. Afterwards, you'll be too tired and crazed to fully take in all the information. There is a lot of nuance to how to effectively employ each of the S's and they have to be done correctly or they don't work as well (or at all). My husband and I found ourselves referring back to this book again and again as things came up, but it was nice that both of us had fully read it before our son was born."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"If you have a new baby buy this book.

Swaddling, shushing, swinging,...they all work better than you can imagine.There are not enough great things to say about this, but just in case you are sick of reading baby books that lecture or read like college textbooks, let me ensure you this is a fun, easy read (I know!!! just what you need because lets face it you don't have time and boring reading just puts you to sleep) and it will help you.I'm a huge fan and plan to use the Happiest Toddler on the Block as well."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book hoping it would give me insight into establishing a sleeping routine with my new daughter. Instead it mainly focused on soothing a baby that won't stop crying. That is a problem I do not have (fortunately). It had a lot of good ideas for babies that are hard to soothe.

If you have a baby with colic you will appreciate not just chapter 2 but the entire book. When you have a collicky baby, everybody becomes an expert and tries to tell you what will work and when it doesn't, as a new parent it's discouraging. The book dispels some of the colic myths and helps a parent understand what colic really is and how to help your baby through it. If I heard one more helpful person suggest gas drops for our inconsolable screamer i was going to cry. This book is a must read for anyone with an inconsolable baby like ours and it has great information even for those who don't."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is an excellent resource for new parents. As first time parents my husband and I had no idea what to do for our baby when we realized she had colic. She was unhappy and crying all the time. A friend recommended this book. It gave us the tools to keep our little girl calm and happy most of the time. Once the colic was gone, we still used the 5 s's. She was sleeping through the night by 6 weeks. This is information that all new parents should have before they bring their baby home from the hospital."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I just LOVE this book. We followed the very easy steps and found it worked like a charm. We now have a 2 year-old daughter that has amazing sleep habits, and I know it all started with helping her learn how to sleep as a newborn thanks to Dr. Karp. I can't wait to see the video when we have another to brush-up on the process.I HIGHLY encourage you to read this book, it works!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"You just don't know what kind of child you are going to have, so this book is a must for first time parents. Anyone can benefit from it, but those of us with fussy babies (guess what, we have one!) will be so glad to have a solution to the shrieking. For anyone who wants to just read the middle two pages - there's a lot of good information in the details, even if some things are repeated. Buy the book; we are glad we did!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's advice in this book is rock-solid. He gives great advice to all mothers, and does not bias against anyone. Using the tips in this book helped my husband and I when our high-energy infant was keeping us up all hours of the night. Our child loved the soothing techniques. I recommend this book to any parent, even if their child is not having trouble sleeping, because it is packed with such excellent information."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Content is sound- look forward to applying it when my little one arrives!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I would have been lost without this book. Even with years of practice with kids, little could have prepared me for the overwhelming experience of having a crying baby as MY sole responsibilty. This book is filled with the tricks of the trade that we as a culture don't learn from our community as a parent might have learned from moms, aunts, & grandmas a few generations ago. It is easy to do the 5 steps outlined in this book. More important is that THEY WORK!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book should be required reading for every first time parent. I read this book while pregnant and was really impressed with how it just made sense! All the other parenting books I had read did not seem to be logical to me.We used his methods and we truly did have the happiest baby on the block! Friends of ours commented on how they would use these methods for their next child since our boy was so happy!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"When our baby was born she was extremely colicky and with that we endured at minimum 5, sometimes up to 12 hours of crying a day-continuous some days! We were given this book when our baby was 6 weeks old and things instantly changed. The ideas are pretty simple, the 5 S's are things we were trying, but we weren't doing them together and in the right order to calm our little one. Our lives changed drastically when we incorporated the techniques in this book and I can't express how thankful I am to have had it as a guide. We loved our daughter through the colic, but after reading and using the ideas in the book we could enjoy her as well. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a baby, but especially someone with a colicky one. If done correctly, it really does work! Just don't forget to swaddle tightly, that really does make a big difference."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We bought this book just after our first son was born. He cried for an hour every night and the techniques in the book helped us calm him almost immediately. This time around our second son was doing just fine until he was four months old. Then no matter what we did he woke up and cried repeatedly during the night and became nearly impossible to get to sleep any time of day. I'd loaned the book out so I grabbed the video and refreshed my memory of the S techniques. And low and behold my darling baby who was taking up to an hour to calm and get to sleep, quieted down and was looking up at me sleepily in just a few minutes. Now a few days later I wrap him up, calm him down, and get him to sleep quickly. Between what we learned from Dr. Karp (who also personally answered a question I sent to the email address on his website I might add) and what we learned from The No-Cry Sleep Solution, our little guy is steadily learning to go to sleep on his back and calm quickly. I'm sure in no time he'll be able to calm himself and my nights will no longer be the hourly screaming fests that were wearing me out (and breaking my heart). Not only does the technique work but I found the book interesting. And what's more, I found Dr. Karp's demeanor on the video very soothing for me! There I was watching it in desperation when I suddenly felt everything would be all right - I will sleep again! Can't wait to get the book and video for my sister-in-law who's expecting in December. Oh and we also used the Happiest Toddler DVD/Book with our older son to much success. Three cheers for Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"this book saved our sanity! This really works.

We discovered that our daughter was colicky and was at our wits end with her constant inconsolable crying. I read this book and started practicing the 5 S's and she is now sleeping much better at night. The best part is, as soon as she starts to cry, we can get her to stop in a matter of minutes!!! I am planning on buying this for all my family and friends who are having babies. I think this is a must have for any new parent with a fussy baby!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's advice has completely changed our fussy infant into a much calmer and happier infant. Consequently we feel better about our parenting skills and we are so thrilled to help our son. As new parents we were at a loss to help calm our son. The constant screaming even after being rested, fed and changed was extremely difficult to tolerate. We read so many books and tried so many suggestions. Dr. Karp's 4 S's allowed us to turn on our baby's calming reflex immediately. Our son sleeps longer and much more peacefully. I highly recommend purchasing the video to see how to apply the method and the book for practical parenting advice. Our life has completely changed because of Dr. Karp. If you have a fussy or colicky baby you would be a fool not to purchase The Happiest Baby On The Block."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is easy to read and the techniques, though not \\"new\\", definitely work to help keep babies happy and parents sane!

We do not believe in the cry it out method, but became so desperate thet we even tried that one night and all three of us ended up crying. The 5 &quot;S's&quot; that Dr. Karp speaks of worked instantly with her when it came to crying and also helped with her sleeping. Our daughter now sleeps through the night and barely ever cries. This book was so helpful that I gave it to my girlfriend whose little boy has colick and it quieted him down within 2 days.I plan on giving this book as baby shower presents because I only wish I had read it before the baby was born."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My little angel is 5 weeks old, and wakes every three hours to eat, sometimes refusing to go back to sleep.

I got it in the mail yesterday, and applied it last night ... my little girl went down at 9:30 and slept until 3:00 am, back down without complaint until 6:30 am!!

After I saw the video, I put the methods to work that same night and I was able to sooth and calm the baby in less then 1/2 hour. Using these methods , she can now sleep better, hence, she can also eat better and sleep even longer. These methods are very well described such that everyone can use them.Thanks to Dr Karp and his methods, my husband and I are as happy as our child now."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I wasn't sure that the methods would REALLY work to calm our little girl, but I was willing to try anything. Everything that Dr. Karp said made sense as I was reading. I didn't use the sucking method because we didn't seem to need it. She loved the swaddling and the shushing. We would get weird looks from friends and family until they saw how quickly our little one calmed down. Definately worth the money to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Alright, so it may be a little bold to declare that this book will help your baby when I have never met you, but I really believe that correctly and consistently applied Dr. Karp's techniques will be wonderful for your little boy or girl. Dr. Karp introduces a 5 step system for calming fussy babies designed to help them feel more secure and \\"at home.\\" My wife and I have been and are now using these techniques with our baby and she responds well.Dr. Karp does a good job of humorously and gently taking on some common \\"truths\\" about what an infant needs and convincingly dispels them. For example, it is a common \\"truth\\" that a newborn needs a quiet room to fall asleep in, when in fact such quietness, as the author points out, is foreign and unnatural to an infant. In swaddling, making a \\"sshhhhhhh\\" sound, holding the baby on her side, swaying, and finally sucking (the baby, not you) the parent mimics the environment of the womb and provides for the first 3-4 months the \\"4th trimester\\" for their baby.The reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 was really just a personal one which may not bother you at all; I found him to be somewhat repetitive in his descriptions and explanations-though I acknowledge that this could also be helpful if the material is completely brand new to you. Also, from my personal, spiritual perspective (Christian) I don't buy what he says about evolution and \\"cave babies,\\" but this does not diminish the value of the book. (Well, he did occasionally use a scripture verse as a heading for a new section WAY out of context, but that wasn't the point of the book).I recommend this book to new parents, and the sooner you get it the better as the techniques are most valuable in the first months and have a bit of a \\"build up\\" effect."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I really enjoyed the book. Some of the ideas of the \\"cavemen mommies\\" were a little far stretched for me, but overall I really thought it offered some useful advice. I can't wait for my baby to arrive so I can try the techniques on him!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As the previous reviews show, this book has a lot of great advice and practical information.Here is my advice: buy this book, but you can save *a lot* of time by starting reading on p. 95.The author spends the first 100 pages or so saying what does *not* cause colic and fussiness, which isn't particularly helpful. I can't see how a tired parent could possibly make it this far (I am still pregnant, and a fast reader, and even I started to wonder when the book would finally get around to the good stuff!)Starting to read at p. 95 (Part 2) can save you a lot of time and frustration."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's tips, especially the 5 S's, are right on. They helped us a great deal with our colicky infant. But it takes him several hundred pages to present a few nuggets of wisdom. And those pages are not always easy or pleasant to read. New parents need succinct, practical advice, not page after page of theory and, \\"Some people think . . . but they're wrong!\\" Honestly, this would make a five-star pamphlet. What he should fill some of those pages with are tips on when and how to wean your baby off the 5 S's."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I studied the child development literature while a graduate student at Harvard. I learned neuroscience in my training as a Neurosurgeon. But when it came time to choose a pediatrician for our baby I sought out Harvey Karp. Our first child was an easy baby, but our 2nd was impossible to comfort. Dr. Karp's swaddling plan was a surpise when he first suggested it, but I liked his explanation - we tried it and it worked. The book wonderfully captures our experience of trusting our children to a great pediatrician."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Harvey's guidelines and information really does work. Speaking from experience, this is information every new parent should have. I could never understand why I didn't see more parents swaddling their newborns. Read the book, try his technics, they work!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp is part of a new movement of parents who prefer gentle approaches to raising children, and the data is on his side. Not only do his techniques work, but everything we know about children tells us that straying from these sorts of gentle approaches causes psychological damage. Karp is buiding on the work of Dr. Lawrence Kelemen (To Kindle a Soul: Ancient Wisdom for Modern Parents and Teachers), and he does a good job. Kelemen's book (To Kindle a Soul) is still the classic guide to getting great kids using gentle techniques. I strongly recommend Karp's book for those interested in putting their children to sleep, and I strongly recommend Kelemen's book for gentle and incredibly effective techniques to handle misbehavior, discipline and punishment problems. Kelemen's book also has a lot of information about gently handling ADD and ADHD kids without medication."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All I can say is this book works! Thank you Doctor Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"While the core information presented in the book is quite interesting and useful, I believe it could have been summarized in two, maximum 10 pages. If the author really wanted to publish a book, he could have added some more information on breastfeeding, or on baby's psychology or anything else. But instead he is just talking about the same things over and over and over....Well, at least I could practice my speed reading skills, skipping pages of unnecessary repetitive information."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a great book7 but the kindle version is horribly transcribed. It is full of errors from the OCR process. It does not seem to have been proofread at all. Amazon needs to fix this and get an update to us. The rate of errors gets worse and worse, making for a difficult and frustrating read."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I totally agree that this could have just been a pamphlet. I'd always heard great things about \\"The Happiest Baby\\" so while I was pregnant my hubby researched Karps' 5 S's (swaddle, swing, shush, suck, side/stomach hold). He did all the necessary research without ever picking up the book (just on-line reviews and talking to family and friends sufficed). We decided to implement the theory and with some work, we got 3 (swing, swaddle, shush) to work. But at 3 months our guy had outgrown them and started sleeping terribly. What then? So I checked the book out from the library and was SUPER disappointed. I knew Karp's theory worked, so I thought I could give it a decent review.Nope.The book does a poor job of telling you how to help your baby \\"grow out\\" of the 5 S's. He offers some weaning suggestions but they didn't work for us. They practically backfired.There are several other reasons this book only merits a 2 star review. 1) After reading other baby sleep books I discovered Karp is not the only author out there who talks about these 5 Ss. In fact, nearly all other books discussed at least 4 of them, if not all 5. But with other books you get the S's plus a lot more about feeding routines, sleep patterns and cues, and other helpful (medically backed) information. 2) There are just WAY too many parent stories. I don't need to read 100 stories from other parents about swaddling, it works, I get it. This is why I suggest simply skimming the book if you do decide to read it. 3) and I'm probably just being picky here . . . but his obsession with the dawn of time drove me bonkers. He talks way too much about how things were done thousands and thousands of years ago. I get the idea that we should stick with what works . . . but please remember that my distant, distant ancestors didn't have electricity or regular shelter or varied modes of transportation . . . we are different. And if you compare the my baby to monkeys one more time! I'll throw this book at you!So overall, I agree that these 5 S's may help you calm your baby, but the book is too long and poorly written, and you can find the same ideas in much better books. In fact, the more I read other authors (Pantley, Weissbluth, Ezzo) the more I disliked this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was recommended by a friend who used the author's methods with her newborn. I found the methods to be extremely useful with my own newborns - swaddling alone would calm them down in seconds. But the style of the writing itself was so repetitive that I found myself irritated.The thesis of the book is that babies are born when they are not because they are developmentally ready to be born, but because that is the moment they are best able to survive outside the womb and be born in a manner that is safe for them and their mothers. The techniques focus on recreating \\"womb-like\\" conditins for the baby, with swaddling, shushing, and jiggling, among other suggestions. The newborn, thrust into a world it is not ready to join, feels comforted by these techniques, and becomes calmer.As noted by other reviewers, these techniques are primarily useful for the baby's first 3 months (longer, if the baby is premature). However, I found that my babies (I had two) responded extremely well to all the suggestions. A good swaddle, and my babies slept peacefully. We eventually stopped swaddling when they outgrew the blankets we used, but by then the babies didn't need it. I suspect that the techniques made our first months with our children much easier.So, why did I only give three stars? Well, I'm not just reviewing the techniques, but the style and tone of the book, which suffer from an overly friendly, supposedly \\"accessible\\" style and was repetitive and cloyingly perky. Another reviewer said it, and I agree, the concepts of the book could probably fit in one small review such as this. My recommendation, therefore, is to borrow the book from a friend or the library, or buy a copy from a used-book store. It is worth your time to read, but it is not worth the money that is charged for it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"With this book and the companion DVD we were able to reduce our sons crying from 3+ hours a night to about 10 minutes. (He is now a happy and sweet 3 month old) If you can only afford one, get the DVD. Who has time to read the whole book when your baby is screaming?"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was the best friend we had the first couple of months. Swaddling is a must-do. We still swaddle our 6 month old sometimes, when he won't settle down. The book is a quick and easy read full of practical advice."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp is an amazing communicator. His book is very easy to understand. I also recommend the DVD and Calming Sounds CD."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book when my son was a couple weeks old and he is now almost 4 years old. I held my baby almost non-stop for his first three months because of this book and am SO glad I did. It was not very difficult to get him used to not being held so much as I eased out of it after 3 months, and as a result, I had a very happy and confident baby who is the same way as a little boy. I get comments on how happy and well-adjusted he is. As far as sleeping, the book didn't help me much there; Joey has never been a good napper at all. I'm still giving this five stars because he had reflux at the time and our doctor at the time was not treating it aggresively enough. I think that may have had a lot to do with his poor napping. I highly recommend this book to new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is just the book that my husband and I needed to raise our daughter. The book was easy to read and straight forward. When my baby was crying all I wanted to know is how to calm her. . .I didn't care what stage she was going through. This book delivered! We also bought the CD of soothing sounds, which we love! At 5 months old our daughter is a great sleeper (so far - knock on wood). She started sleeping through the night at 5 weeks old (usually from 8 PM to 8 or 9 AM)."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is amazing. Our newborn baby (3 weeks old) was crying and crying at night. We couldn't get her to stop. I plopped on the bed and started reading this book and boy oh boy did the techniques made her stop crying; it was amazing.It is also very helpful because they teach you how to swaddle and then how to wean the baby off the swaddle when they are ready. The best book ever!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was recommended to us before the birth of our first child by our friend - and since the birth of our son, my husband had called that friend several times to thank her for recommending it!The book itself has 2 parts. The first part describes how our culture is different than others in the phylosophy of baby care, and how \\"colic\\" is a misnomer...i thought this part of the book was kind of long, especially if you have a screaming newborn at home and you are trying to get to the good stuff. i would say, if you got this book before giving birth, definitely read the first part, otherwise, skip to the part number 2, the meat of the theory.The second part of the book in detail describes the 5S's of baby soothing. I must say that the technique works impecably. you may not get it on the first try, but do persevere, and the benefits are plentiful. While our son was never particularly colicy, the several particularly horrific screaming episodes he did have could only be terminated only by using techniques described in the book. In addition, we used the 5S's to establish his sleeping routine. My son originally used to struggle somewhat against the swaddling, but after a couple of weeks, he started to want to be swaddled. How do we know this? Well, if he is tired and cranky because he's just not having a good day and unable to settle himself to sleep, as soon as you lay him down to be swaddled, he relaxes and smiles, and is able to fall asleep in no time.My son is now almost 4 months old. He still sleeps much better and longer if he is swaddled. We haven't had to rock/sush/jiggle him for over a month and a half now - just swaddling does the trick (i mention this because in the beginning i really worried that we'd be rocking him and jiggling him until he is 5 years old!). Couple of notes about the swaddling: i could never find a blanket large enough to swaddle my son. He was too large for the receiving blankets since birth. I bought a twin-sized sheet and cut it to make a large square - we've been using this to swaddle him since very successfully. In addition, there is a product you can buy in baby stores called the \\"swaddler\\" - we haven't had much luck with this. it's good to swaddle the baby in this for maybe a quick nap, but he wiggles out of it quite quickly, so it's useless for the night's sleep.In summary - great book, a must-have for new parents who want some sanity to remain in their lives. when pressed for time, read part 2 only."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is wonderful and should be read by every new parent. We fortunately do not have a really fussy baby, but still had a little 30 minute struggle every night before bed. I got this book, read it the first night I had it, and that night our 30 minute struggle changed to 30 seconds. He went from waking every 2-3 hours each night to sleeping at least a 5 hour stretch the first night we tried this, and ever since. It's written in an easy to understand and entertaining manner. Easy reading, extrememly helpful, and worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"First of all there is nothing in this book that is really new to moms living in South East Asia (like myself) as most of the 5 S's are widely implemented. I read this book as i thought it may provide me an alternative to the crying out method of putting baby to sleep. Now that my baby No2 is 4 months old, i have to wean her from the pacifier and swaddling. She has been sleeping badly at night (waking up every 1/2 hour)as the swaddling cloths are getting too small and the pacifier keeps falling out! The book is great to calm your baby in the 1st 3 months, esp if they are very restless. BUT...the book doesnt really tell you how difficult getting rid of the binky and the sawddling will/may be. (He wrote that a mother took only 3 days to remove the pacifier but did not elaborate how-made it sound easy but its not! I have tried for weeks) So it looks like I will have to resort to the crying-out method to help her sleep (like i did with my firstborn) It is painful to hear your child cry, but when the baby smiles and coos at you in the morning after a good night sleep, it's worth it. For this I recommend Dr Marc Weissbluth's book. (BTW, I also tried the Pantley book-sounds like a better alternative to those who want a gentle approach but honestly, I am too tired to wait for a month for it to work!) So 2 stars as this only helps in the early months (for me, at least)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As 'owner' of a fussy baby, I was inspired to buy this book upon seeing the large number of 5 star reviews here. Quite how this book is so universally regarded is a mystery to me. I think that anxious parents are judging the book by their results after following its advice, and not by the writing of the book, which is really quite dismal.As some reviewers have said, this book could have been summarized into about 5 pages. When it comes down to it, the only content is the suggestion of the '5 S's' (suck, swaddle, shush, side position, swing) which are repeated ad nauseum throughout. And of those 5, how many are innovative and non-obvious: I would contend none of them.An example of the frustrating nature of this book is the explanation of colic. In a chapter entitled 'what is colic', Karp tediously explains by means of his example patients, what colic is not, and incredibly never actually answers the question in the title.Very poor. Save your money and use your instincts of swaying, shushing and pacifying your baby, that you new anyway... didn't you?"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Let me save you some money and disclose the amazing secret of Dr. Karp's technique right here and now: swaddle your baby, put your baby on its side/stomach (but never let the baby sleep on its side/stomach), shush the baby, swing the baby, stick the pacifier into your baby's mouth, all in this strict order -- and presto! You are done. Does one really need 267 pages in order to recite this? Dr. Karp feels he does, or at least his wallet tells him so.What a horror. First of all, there is enough information in this book to fill a 5-page brochure at the most, 10 if you would like to be generous. The rest if fluff, empty fill, incessant repetition, inane pictures, unnecessary and insulting stories about \\"primitive\\" people and Dr. Karp's own patients (see more below on that).Second -- the language. That Harvey Karp has a God Complex is evident from page 1; the reason for that is still a mystery to me. Well, I do admit that to write a fairly long book about nothing, and to make a lot of money by publishing and successfully marketing this book (and now, heavens help me, I see there is a DVD out) -- that does take a particular kind of cunning and intelligence. To solicit at least a couple of good reviews from accredited pediatricians also must have taken some work. But does it really justify the language of fantastic condescension that Harvey Karp uses throughout his book? One imagines the world full of lobotomized idiots unable to read a complex sentence, but popping out babies as if there is no tomorrow; and yet, I bet that even a semi-literate teenage mom of five would still find this book incredibly patronizing. Repetition -- ostensibly to help the new parents remember the simple truths, but clearly used to a) make the reader feel stupid, and b) fill more pages of the book -- are sure to drive anyone halfway intelligent absolutely insane.Finally, let us return to the \\"primitive\\" people. You think Dr. Karp consecends to you? Wait till you read stories about backward cultures, and, still worse, about Harvey Karp's own patients who hail from such far-away places as Russia! Let's take a look at page 109, and read a heart-warming story about Karp's patient who emigrated from Russia to Los Angeles. A confused foreign moron that she is, she is having trouble understanding the wonderful doctor, struggling to make sense of his words of wisdom. But then, when the doctor shows her how to swaddle her baby, she erupts in a wonderful monologue, whereupon we learn that in her village, mothers swaddle their kids and put belts around them -- yet another piece of ancient primitive folk wisdom that we in America forgot! The most insulting thing is that the young woman's accent is actually replicated in the book, and the offending words are underscored -- lest you decide that it is Dr. Karp who cannot spell \\"village.\\" Interestingly enough, Karp chooses very carefully whose accent or manner of speaking he dares to replicate: for some reason, not a single Ebonics phrase is transcribed in the book -- perhaps because Karp doesn't accept African-American patients, or perhaps because he is smart enough not to insult them. But Russians are a fair game (there are others). If his patient, named Elena (of course -- isn't every Russian?), even exists, she ought to be rather angry; but I doubt she is real. Russian villagers rarely find themselves consulting UCLA pediatricians -- not to mention that the accent rendered by Karp is utterly wrong. Russian alphabet doesn't have the letter \\"w\\" -- therefore, the lucky Karp-treated villager would be replacing \\"when\\" with \\"ven\\", and not \\"village\\" with \\"willage.\\"I am not sure whether Dr. Karp still has a title of assistant professor at UCLA because he is a practicing pediatrician, and cannot therefore go up for tenure, or because he hasn't come up for tenure yet. I hope the latter is the case: this book alone is an ample reason why the said tenure should be denied.If you must, go to the library and photocopy pages 94-99; you will learn nothing new (any pediatrician is likely to give you the same advice), but you will have a handy reference on Karp's methods. These 5 pages are still full of fluff, but they will cost you close to nothing."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Good info, an easy read, works most of the time. What more could a new parent of a fussy baby want?But what troubles me about this book is that the author has written and is selling information that has been available to parents here and abroad for generations. What is all the fuss about? Nothing Dr. Karp writes of is new information or information difficult to obtain. I read all of it when I was pregnant l5 years ago (Spock, Leach, Brazelton, 'Mothering' magazine all contain this information) and, long before I was pregnant, I had heard about or seen most of the methods used (I grew up with 3 sibs). Further, some of the info or 'methods' are instinctive for most new parents, eg nursing a fussy baby.So, the question arises, are new parents today somehow more tuned out of this age-old info and know-how than earlier generations? Do they perhaps have the info they need to calm a fussy baby but need to be 'reminded' of it in a new format? Or is Dr. K. simply doing what is often done: remarketing very old formulas in shiny, new packaging?Buy the book and you decide. It can't hurt. But if, like most new parents, you are concerned about mounting expenses, you might want to first recheck your stack of parenting guides and interview a wiser, older parent or two before you fork over the bucks for yet another book telling new parents how to parent."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great info with supporting facts and examples, but this could definitely be recapped to half the length it is and still get the point across just fine.As far as how effective his method is, my OBGYN and birth coach swear by it, and I use swaddled and shhh my baby all the time with great results. He isn't a fan of pacifiers so I'm just waiting patiently as he explores sucking his hand now (7weeks). And he loves his FIsher Price swing to entertain him and put his to sleep. I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you have a fussy baby!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All my friends with kids insisted I read this book.

This book did give me hope that it can be overcome."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Get this book and read it cover to cover before your baby arrives and you will be well prepared! I got this book instead of attending the class at my hospital, which was highly recommended for new parents. The class was based on the book and I am completely satisfied with reading the book instead. I used nearly all the techniques in this book and my baby rarely cries unless she's hungry.

However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the same information is addressed over and over throughout the book. I could have read a few page article on the 5Ss versus an entire book. I recommend if you can get it very cheap. Otherwise don't pay full price."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and some of the advice sounds good.

I could not finish it, and forgot most of it immediately.10/13/12 update- the advice in this book really works, I am giving it more stars!

It's better to reference it as you go along."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book has excellent information on soothing an infant! We used all the techniques with our two children; it seems to work like magic (most of the time!)!! Our daughter had colic, and I don't know what we would have done without knowing how to sooths her! If you really like to read, you could get the book; however it is rather repetitive. We watched the DVD with the same name, and it contains all the information the book has, yet only takes an hour to watch. Plus you see the techniques demonstrated.

As a first time mother I lived and died by this book. Motherhood is wonderful but it does not come with an instruction book (until now!). &quot;The Happiest Baby on the Block&quot; gave me the skills to handle most situations for the first (and roughest)few months of parenthood.

I have to say that this book has fascinated me like no other! Dr. Karp has absolutely found the key to soothing a baby. Several of the young mothers in our program have implemented this technique after watching the video and are all thrilled. I am the mother of 4 children and remember the days of walking the floor with a screaming child that I just couldn't calm down. Even the very best parents can become frustrated and feel like they just can't take it any longer. I am convinced that Dr. Karp's technique can be learned by anyone and will work for any baby. It is my goal to put a copy of this book into the hands of every new parent in our county!

We got the book and DVD several months before our first child was born. We started using his techniques day one in the hospital to calm his crying. He is now 3 months old and still loves to be swaddled - he actually smiles while we wrap him! I don't think he has ever cried more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time when we swaddle him, put him on his side, rock and shhhh him. He usually calms instantly! He now sleeps swaddled for almost 10 hours at night. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"While our dear daughter doesn't have colic, I have found this book to be a huge help during those fussy evenings.

I love it. my 1 month old baby has benefited a great deal."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I really owe my deepest graditude to Dr. Karp. Without this book I honestly do not know how I would have made it through the first four months of my EXTREMELY colicky daughter's life.She screamed all the time (unless she was sleeping). It really was a nightmare. We were at the doctor's office every week, the hospital, and numerous specialists. Thank God there was nothing physically wrong, but I was getting so frustrated. I would leave each appointment in tears. She had been misdiagnosed with acid reflux (the meds did not work). I remember vividly shaking and crying in waiting rooms with exhaustion and despair. No one had any specific help for me.In my spare time (all 15 minutes of it) I would try to research on the internet. That's when I came across this book. I immediately set to work, trying everything. My daughter was swaddled (I found it tricky to keep her tight), rocked, worn in a carrier, and we listened to static on the radio in her room and in the car for 4 solid months. Sure she was still a challenge, but a managable one! I finally understood where she was coming from, Dr. Karp made this perfectly clear...I felt so sorry for her.Despite Dr. Karp's reassurance, I felt sure she would be addicted to this elaborate routine...I can now happily say that after four months it slowly got better. I am so proud to say that I now have a happy, healthy, one year old baby girl!!!! She goes down to bed saying &quot;Nigh Nigh&quot; and with a kiss. No static, no rocking, no sucking, nothing!!! I never thought I would see the day when I would be able to say this. Thank you Dr. Karp, with all my heart!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book really helped me through the first six weeks of my son's life. I disagree with a previous poster...not all infants become addicted to swaddling. Our son outgrew it around 3 months.Huzzah for Dr. Karp and his book. Even if a child loves being swaddled... is that really so terrible? I think it would be worse to have a crying newborn than a 6+ month old who can't sleep at night."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am an Early Childhood Specialist and I present workshops for childcare providers and parents. One of the biggest complaints of people in childcare is that they just cannot get some infants to stop crying and it disrupts the entire setting. What to do? Enter Dr. Karp and his wonderful techniques. The book is so helpful for parents or providers to have at their fingertips and the DVD amazes them. People are fascinated by the 4th Trimester Theory and the truth about colic. Those who are still doubtful are sold by the time they witness the techniques firsthand. The workshops I give using Dr. Karp's materials are always full of new people. The stress level in a child care setting immediately drops when an infant is soothed by the 5 Ss. Wonderful for parents, even better for childcare providers who work with infants."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was given to me by well-meaning friends, but parents please be advised: After reading through this book twice, it is clearly for colicky babies who cry for hours on end, and not for infants who cry every now and then for various reasons (hungry, wet diaper, startled, etc.). This is not apparent from the way the book is passed around to new parents. I was tempted to try the techniques when my 1 month old little girl cried, but quickly realized that loudly shushing her, rocking her, tightly swaddling her, corking her with a pacifier, etc., etc. would only over-stimulate her and lead to more prolonged crying. Instead, I have found that when she has been fed, diapered, and burped but is still crying, going to a quiet room and cradling her in my arms while gently rubbing her back works just fine. She usually calms down and becomes drowsy. Since most parents do not have colicky babies, but rather babies who cry at times during the day for the usual reasons, I would suggest trying a few common sense methods first before further stimulating your baby with these techniques. However, if you have a baby who cannot be soothed for several hours, this book outlines techniques that (from what my friends tell me) work very well."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's book is a lifesaver. After working with him to calm our daughter, we were able to enjoy her and not have to worry each day as we got closer to &quot;the fussy&quot; part of the day.

If you buy only one book about babies, this should be it!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I cannot express enough how THANKFUL I am for this book. I am NOT a Dr. Karp groupie, but this book saved my sanity. I don't even have a colicky baby--I have a pretty normal one--but the simple techniques calmed him so much when he was fussy or crying. The things in the book seem so basic and easy, yet no parent I know had done them. Seasoned parents who raised one, two, even six kids had never heard of them. Yet to hear their stories, their kids did a lot more crying than mine.If you buy one baby book, buy this one!!!PS This book is only intended for babies from birth through about 4 months, so buy it when you're pregnant and read it then!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"the techniques in this dvd really work. we are first time parents who watched this dvd and tried all the techniques...you cannot imagine how many comments we got from friends such as \\"is your baby always this calm and happy?\\" I definetly recommend this to ALL parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book contains the advice you're looking for -- namely, now to calm your newborn -- but it's buried in anecdote after anecdote.

I mean none! About 3 months after my son was born, we were searching for anything that would help. I came across this and decided to try it (I also bought the matching video). We start \\"wrapping\\" my son and using the other calming techniques at bedtime and WOW! What a relief! I \\"wrapped\\" my boy until he was 5 months old and the receiving blankets didn't fit around him anymore. I worried that we would be back to \\"square one\\" when I stopped, but by then he was fine sleeping without it. He continues to be a very good sleeper. He is 3 1/2 now and goes to bed without much fuss, no night light, and generally doesn't wake until morning. I think it might be because of the great sleep habits established using the techniques we learned from this book. We are very satisfied and I feel lucky that I stumbled across the this information!!! I recommend it to anyone that I know who is expecting because we certainly could have used it 3 months earlier than we found it. It would have made those first few months much more pleasant for everyone."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is another baby book must have.

The theory that Dr. Karp discusses is very interesting but best of all it really works. We followed his method for soothing our son and saw great results.

I highly recommend this book, and if you don't have time to read it there is a DVD available too."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Even if you've had previous children, this book really helps to make you feel like a real expert. Because every childs temperment is so different, its always good to be prepared ahead of time with tools in your pocket for the not so easy babies. I bought both the DVD and the book. I enjoyed reading the book because it goes more in depth and contains helpful tips that are not included on the DVD. I recommend the DVD as well, because until you see it being done, its kind of hard to believe that a baby will calm down that quickly. Plus, I'm such a visual person it was good to see how the Dr. recommended doing the swaddling. I don't feel my baby will ever turn on his calming reflex as fast as the ones shown on the DVD, but its always a relief to know I have the ability to calm my baby down relatively easy using one or more of the 5 S's."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The advice in this book is pure magic. Our baby wasn't colicky but she was Very fussy. Everytime I did what this book suggested - swaddle, jiggle, hold sideways, and shush - she would stop crying instantly. Yes, Instantly. It was like pure magic. Nothing worked before this book. I encourage everyone to buy it, it is a life-saver.I agree with a previous review, in that it is most helpful the first three months. That's what it's geared towards. The author calls it the fourth trimester and focuses on that. After I started swaddling her (as the author clearly isslustrates how to do) my daughter started sleeping through the night. I no longer need this book because I was able to be so responsive to her needs in the first three months, that she is now secure enough to sleep on her own without being swaddled.This book is also very well organized. As a matter of fact, you don't even have to read the whole book! He has helpful summaries and bullet points along the way. Just reading one page where he clearly and succinctly summarizes everything can save your life the first three months and get your baby on the road to being a trusting, self-suffient child.This book did more than just help me soothe my infant. It increased my self-esteem as a parent. I knew that jiggling my baby soothed her. But the horrified looks on people's faces when you start jiggling a baby! Oh my! At least after reading this book it helped me know that it was indeed ok to do what intutively worked.Also, the author is right - there's no spoling a baby. I \\"spoiled\\" my daughter like crazy. And what do I have now? A clingly baby who is addicted to jiggling and swaddling (as many people predicted when I followed the author's advice - \\"she'll be addicted and you'll have to swaddle her FOREVER!\\"). No! I have a happy baby who goes to sleep on her own and sleeps through the night. By the way, she's 4 months old. She Never needs to be jiggled anymore, or swaddled. I still put white noise on in the background for her though. But I hear many adults sleep that way too.This book is also very sensitve and kind to the needs of our precious little babies. He says that the first three months are the fourth trimester. That the baby was in you for nine whole months and got used to there being sound and movement and confinement. And when they're born it's unnatural (and, in my opinion, cruel) to leave them to their own devices and figure out how to be a human being in the world right away. They need our help while they get their bearings. They're so tiny and the world is so big.As a matter of fact, many book I read suggest not swaddling past the second month, or even past the first month. But the author recommends doing it for as long as the baby needs it. All babies are different and need to take their own time! And not only for as long as the baby needs it, but also as much as the baby needs it. That's right, swaddle the baby as often as the baby wants it. Some books say this hinders development but the author points out that if the baby needs it, it calms the baby down enough for the baby to be a ble to pay attention to the world and learn. My baby wanted to be swaddled for many hours out of every day. I felt guilty becuase so many other resources say not to do that. But this book helped me see that it was only natural. The author asked - doesn't your baby seem happier this way? YES!! She was So much happier when she was swaddled. And this did not make her addicted to it, as I said before - she went from being swaddled most of the day to not being swaddled Ever quickly and effortlessly.I know this is a long review. I just have to strongly recommend this book. It's usefuleness and help go so much beyond sleeping issues. I love this book. It is the single most useful book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The thesis in the book is excellent - by understanding a baby's needs and how the first few months are really the \\"fourth trimester,\\" we can learn to use his five-steps to calming a colicky infant.The problem isn't that the advice is bad, because it's excellent and very practical. It's that he just repeats and repeats the same points, occasionally slipping in another nugget of useful info. This should be a 10-page handout, not a book. Heck, I probably could paste in enough directions for you to do this in this comment box, thus saving you from buying the whole book.My advice - check it out from the library or borrow it, because in 20 minutes you'll have figured it out and you you can spend the money on diapers (the need of which cannot be abridged!)."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is an excellent read - having a nice easy style and with some Anthropology thrown in. Be warned, this is not very good for babies over three months. I have a two month old who is fussy, and I found that I already used a lot of these techniques without knowing it! The one thing that has really been helpful so far is swaddling. It seems to help her take naps better. For 3 months and up, look at &quot;The No-Cry Sleep Solution&quot;. It is similar to this book in that it uses a common sense approach to getting babies to calm down or sleep. Also, Healthy Sleep, Happy Child&quot; gives a more scientific explanation of baby sleep."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book saved our lives! Our little girl came home from the hospital wailing and it never stopped. She would cry for hours upon hours and nothing would soothe her--not cuddling, not feedings, not burping, not changings, not my mother-in-law (the baby soother extraordinaire), nothing...until this book!The horror is finally over--the technique absolutely works every time. The book is well-written, easy to follow and the examples of other parents going through this are so reassuring. I am happy to report that now, at 7 weeks, we have lots of cooing, many smiles, bonding (nearly impossible with a screaming baby) and a lot more sleeping. You can call the author Dr. Karp, but in our house he is reverentially referred to as Saint Harvey--our patron saint of babies. If you have a fussy baby I can not recommend this book enough. It truly works miracles!If I were the Queen of Everything I would make sure all new parents and hospital nurses learned this method. It could save so many, so much. Thank you Saint Harvey!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have read just about every major book that purports to explain why some babies are fussy and how to calm them. None of them can hold a candle to Dr. Karp's book. Forget about gas and all the other theories -- this book clearly and easily explains what newborns are experiencing. And the best part is the technique for calming that is based on cutting edge medical research. The book's explanation of the &quot;calming reflex&quot; is pretty fascinating, but if you really want to calm your baby, buy the accompanying video with the book. It is an eye-opener! When you see Dr. Karp take a dozen different babies and calm them in a matter of seconds, you finally see what the book can't stress enough -- it's a calming REFLEX, just like swallowing, and anyone can learn how to trigger it. The video is a surefire way to assure yourself that you are mastering the technique. It shows the technique again and again, with helpful tips and trouble-shooting. This is the ticket to new parents' peace of mind."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Well, Dr. Karp's methods have worked well on my newborn, and I stress newborn. He presents some interesting facts about other cultures where crying babies are rare and colic doesn't exist. These cultures mostly have their babies at their sides in a sling, and unlimited access to suckle at mother's breast. With baby in a snug sling, constant body contact, the feeling of constant motion and breast milk access, Dr. Karp states this mimcs conditions in the womb: tight fit, constant movement, and lack of hunger from being fed via the umbilical cord while in utero. He goes on to say that months 0-3 of baby's life are the missing \\"fourth trimester\\", hence his methods of the following 5 S's work well since they imitate the womb environment.The 5 S's are as follows:1. Swaddle - he describes and illustrates an excellent swaddle technique, the tighter, the more womb-like2. Side / Stomach - laying baby on side or stomach. He reiterates that when laying baby on stomach, baby should NEVER be left unattended. Positioning in this way is most comfortable for baby, when he's on his back, he has the sensation of free-falling, and thus feeling insecure.3. Shush - baby was used to hearing your blood flow for those 9 months, so a loud shushing will calm baby down. Ever notice how he quiets when you turn on the vacuum? I've used a white noise machine, all the loud shushing got me blue in the face and most nearly passed out!4. Swinging - rhythmic, jiggling motion. You don't necessarily have to use a swing for this one. He describes the motion as being a very nervous person holding a baby. You use very tiny shaky movements, movements must be tiny, other wise shaking baby with long, hard jerks may result in shaken baby syndrome. This movement imitates the constant movement he felt while in-utero.5. Suck - sucking on a pacifier, nipple, your finger, etc...These 5 S's will initiate the calming reflex when done in that order and in the correct way. We've all used those methods to try to calm baby, but we've likely used them as separate entities. Much like the knee-jerk reflex works only when your doctor hits your knee at the exact location, the calming reflex works only when the S's are done in an exact manner. He describes in detail how to do this.So far it's worked for my daughter. My huge concern is, what happens after she passes her three month mark? Dr. Karp states that after three months, baby will start self-calming and will rely on the 5 S's less and less. Judging by all the \\"How to Get Your Baby to Calm and to Sleep\\" books out there, I have my doubts. He does well in calming a newborn, but beyond the newborn stage, he offers very little. He really needs to consider changing the title to \\"The Happiest Newborn on the Block\\" to better reflect the content of the book. So if your baby is less than three months, this may work for you, if your baby is older, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is one of the best books on babies I've ever read, and one of the worst written, and I think you should buy it.Now don't get me wrong. I love the information in this book, and I'm fond of the author's voice. Our first baby was fussy, fussy, fussy, and screamed for hours each night. 8 years later, we had our second baby and a copy of The Happiest Baby on the Block and life was so very different. I regularly amazed family and friends with my ability to instantly calm our screaming little girl. Everything our culture told me about how to calm our first baby was wrong, and everything Dr. Karp told me about babies the second time was right.But the writing is incredibly bad. Dr. Karp babbles, there's no other way to put it. He takes 10 times as many words and pages to say anything than he really needs. If I were his English teacher I would give him a C-, hand him back his paper, and tell him he could raise his grade by making it one quarter the length. Of course, then he wouldn't have a book long enough to publish...By all means buy this book if you have a newborn, or are expecting, or have a friend with a baby. The ideas are so useful and sensible that they are truly revolutionary for a culture that has lost so much knowledge of how to raise truly happy babies. But when you read it, think of it as spending a long evening with your old uncle, who never tells a story straight through, but has nuggets of true wisdom you can't get anywhere else.5 stars for content, 1 star for form, bonus star for being so likeable."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Love the book and the skills he teaches. I am a family physician and I agree with Dr. Karp that these skills are not taught in medical school or residency. His wrap (swaddle) is infinitely superior to the one we are generally taght on the wards. It had been frustrating to have very little to offer parents for inconsolable babies who were just fed, burped and diapered- yet they were still crying. Now I will recommend this book.Some people may be concerned that he advocates a Side/Stomach position for comfort, when the pediatric advice says that babies have to be put to sleep on their backs. However Dr. Karp's recommendation for these comfort positions are for when baby is awake or you are awake with your baby to keep an eye on their face. You wouldn't want to fall asleep with your baby in this position, or put baby down and leave them unattended in one of these positions.Also some people may be concerned that pacifiers can be used for the Sucking comfort measure. I believe that pacifiers are OK if the baby is breastfeeding well, and if you can hold off until they are one month or so old. One month old is about the age that \\"colic\\" often starts anyway. If your baby really likes to suck, and breastfeeding isn't yet well established, you can try your finger. Also, the sucking part often isn't even needed, as the other 4 S's work so well to calm your baby.Overall, highly recommended. I plan to give it to my other friends when they start their families."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp was a Godsend when we needed him most. His superb advice helped us calm our twin boys and enabled them and us to sleep. Up until reading his book, we had very fussy baby boys who would not sleep for prolonged periods of time. The first time we used the 5 S's, the boys slept 3 hours. Prior to that they would only sleep an hour at most because their gas pains would wake them up. It's obvious that Dr. Karp researched his methods and delivers a succinct method that can help all parents. Out of all the books that I've read, this one has made a significant difference in my childrens' lives and is a MUST HAVE!Thank you Dr. Karp."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As other have said this is a very helpful book, especially for the first 6-8 weeks.

We used all the techniques with our first born son. He had to be swaddled until he was 6 months olds.

We were informed on what was going on behind the scenes in his little world and how to cope with the fussing without becoming frustrated and overwhelmed. It is/was a life saver for even an occasionally fussy infant. The swaddling technique, although difficult to master, is still allowing our 5 month old to sleep better at night and at naps. A must for new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Got a lot of good ideas from this book. Saved us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Your baby will love you for reading this book. This is a wonderful book by Dr. Harvey Karp. He teaches you the basic elements on newborn baby care for the \\"4rt trimester\\", i.e. the first 3 months of your baby's life. If you love and care about your baby, you should read this book. Dr. Harvey Karp guides first time parents on how to care for your baby, according to the 5 S's - Swaddling, Swinging, Side/Stomach position, Shhhing, and Sucking. These S's are immensely effective as well important for soothing your baby. You will learn fantastic information about how colic does not exists in non western cultures around the world as, as mother's in ancient cultures, never put down their baby, leave their babies to cry, but rather hold them, rock them, and nurse them, around the clock, which is the right and effective way to love your baby, turn on a baby's \\"calm reflex\\", and to create a \\"womb like environment\\", as newborn baby's are so immature, that they still long for the womb environment. Pediatricians and wise parents know that you can never spoil a baby. Baby's cries are their only way of communication and should not be ignored. Dr. Harvey Karp guides us parents on how to soothe our babies, calm them, love them, nurture them. I highly recommend this book!I also like to recommend his book \\"The Happiest Toddler on the block\\"! A beautiful book!In addition, for new nursing mothers, I like recommend \\"The Nursing Mother's Companion\\" by Kathleen Huggins, as nursing is not intuitive, but a learned art. With this book you will successfully not only learn how to nurse your child, but to get the important support you need!\\"The Natural Child\\" by Jan Hunt, is also a must-have, and \\"Natural Family Living\\" by Peggy O'Mara. These are all 5 star books!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I had seen the author of this book on the Today Show a few years ago, and his method of calming babies really stayed with me. Our newborn is very even-tempered, but she was still having nightly evening meltdowns, where we would try everything, but just couldn't seem to get her comfortable and to stop crying. So I ordered this book, and it is awesome. I don't know if I buy into all the theories behind the methods, but the methods sure worked with our daughter! The idea is that young babies under 3 months of age still need the womb to be mimicked in order to calm themselves, since they are not yet capable of self-soothing. It explains in detail how to do the 5 recommended things, which are how to hold the baby, rock her, shhh in her ear, swing her, and swaddle her when she sleeps. All these things seemed pretty logical to me and we thought we'd try it...first night we did, she cried less than 5 minutes, and when we swaddled her to go to sleep, instead of her usual 3 hours during the night, she actually slept 7 hours straight! She has been sleeping 7 hours since we started this method! Incredible!! Now that is worth any $6 book!!! I highly recommend it -- worked for us!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We are first time parents to a 10 week old baby boy and bought the book along with the DVD at the recommendation of our hospital. Our son is a \\"high needs/high maintenance\\" baby that needed to be held constantly so swaddling and shushing were the only ways we could get him to sleep and settle down. If you have the time, the book is an easy read and goes into great detail debunking some of the myths surrounding colicky babies, explains the fourth trimester, and how each of the five S techniques work to calm down a crying baby. However, if you need a visual or don't have time to read the book then the DVD is a good choice. Our biggest challenge wasn't figuring out how to swaddle (although it takes practice!) but finding a square blanket. Rectangular blankets don't seem to work as well. We've also used swaddle blankets with the velcro tabs and those work especially well if you have a baby that squirms a lot.This is a must have for all first time parents!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The first part starts a little slow but this book is an easy ready and has a lot of great information."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"When absolutely nothing else worked, this book was a gift. The 5 S's meant one of those tools (or all five at once) worked.

It really helped us out with the great suggestions that Really Work! It also answered some questions for us which helped reassure us that we were doing the right things (how long should we use the swing, etc.) I think the person who said it's only good for the first 3 months is right but that was the hardest part to adjust to anyway and that's exactly when you need this info. I would recommend that you (AND DADDY TOO) - read it right before the baby comes (esp. if it's your first) then again after the baby is home. Good luck!!I also found out about the next book, \\"The Happiest Toddler on the Block\\"....I haven't read it yet but I'm sure it will be just as helpful."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was recommended by a friend and it literally saved my sanity during the first 3 months at home with a colicky baby.

We didn't follow his plan down to the letter (and Dr. Karp says it is adaptable for each baby's needs) because my daughter hated having her arms swaddled in, so we swaddled her arms-out and it worked like a charm. She started sleeping through the night at 8 weeks, and the four \\"S's\\" worked incredibly well when she needed help calming down. I really appreciated the fact that this plan helped us help her adjust to the world during her \\"fourth trimester\\" in a loving and comfortable way.

Also, dont just read the reviews and think you can just skip the book because someone tells you what the steps are. There is more info to the steps and how relative they are rather than just the steps alone. Just wanted to add this in as my previous review was sleep deprived and seems slightly incoherent.)We had a fussy baby, we thought it might be colic cause it only happened at night. Except after learning about colic, it really didnt fit or aleast it was only mild case/signs of being colic. Which actually defies the definition of colic., I was looking around doing research on how to calm our fussy baby and came across this book a few times. I read the reviews and noticed someone summed it up for you. I took that to heart and didnt buy the book thinking I had the just of it. However my attempts to calm baby were only half successful. Ironically enough a few days later my wife had meet with a friend who owned this book and let her borrow it.I read through it tonight when baby got fussy and I'm so glad it made it's way into our lives. It really is a life savor and you cant really sum up this book by just saying use the 5 S's and what they are if you really want to get it right. There really was a good bit more detail in it this and for such a great price, it's wisdom cant be beat.

I really wish I had known about this book 3 months ago when my son was born... it would have spared me from the confusion, heartache, insanity, and self blame that seems to come with the territory of having a colicky baby. Even now though this book has helped me a lot - if it wasn't for this book I would still be spending my afternoons and evenings miserable because my little guy is tired and cranky and won't take a nap. This isn't a gimmick or something that takes tons of practice before it starts working - it really works from the get-go! Most importantly though it is such a huge source of support for new mothers, who often find themselves in a conflict between what their instincts tell them and what others tell them, and in the course tend to start doubting themselves and their abilities more and more."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I received this book with my 3rd child.

When my 3rd came along, I was ready to try anything. I didn't want to go thru that ever again. Wrapping my baby tightly and loudly saying \\"sh\\" in his ear was the BEST advice I have EVER been given. I now give this book to every new mom I know. Excellent. I just bought 2 more."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"So, before I begin my review of this product, here's our background... our son who is currently 6 weeks has had to be sent to the hospital with gas pains so severe that the emergency room doctors were concerned that he might be trying to pass a kidney stone. Turns out he was allergic to soy, we had tried breast, standard formula and lactose intolerance formula. He had a negative reaction to all (including breast believe it or not, I went through tests also to determine what was in my milk even though I was on a mild diet.... cause was deemed later on to be for a substance need, our baby needed rice formula). So..... we tried just the rice formula with the children's mylicon with the VentAire bottles.... somewhat of an improvement, but our child was still needing to go to the doctor weekly for checkups without much success, our pediatrician would even call us daily to see how he was doing. Constipation was questioned, but was never an issue. Our breakthrough occurred when we took our son to a specialist appointment and the lady asking us if our son had excess gas since she noticed that Mylicon was listed as one of his meds. I stated quickly yes and told her of our ordeal. I was told that she was the grandmother of 5 children and a mother of 3 and had tried EVERYTHING to cure their extreme colic. The remedy they found, Hyland's colic tablets, Dr. Brown's bottles, and rice formula. After the doctor appointment I went to the store to give these products a try....... and it was like an angel had spoken to us. Our child could breathe again and was longer tense in the body, as he was making progress against constantly trying to push. I know that I'm being candid but I am hoping that this will help other parents and children that have been or will be in our situation. We are on day 4 of the product switch and WOW, he's a brand new baby! If these products can help a child who's been hospitalized, hopefully these can help yours as well. Pedialyte also works as well to help calm the tummy. I've been using tylenol every 5 hours (excluding when he sleeps) for the first week and have been continuing to use the Mylicon to help with the surface gas. Burping has never been an issue, but his burps and toots have become louder and more productive, sometimes just shifting him in our arms can help him to expel gas! I'll be making this post in numerous areas in hopes to help people.Hyland's colic tablets, Dr. Brown bottles, Enfamil AR Lipil, infant's tylenol, gas drops is literally our formula to success."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I got this one before my son was born, my second child after a gap of almost 9 years!Loved it!!! I did not use the pacifier, but did always swaddle my little one, with one of his arms out so he could suck on his thumb if need be. We used the swing until he was 4 months old.

I will try to make this review as concise as possible and to the point.1) I recommend DVD instead of a book. I got the DVD as a baby shower gift and put it away instead of watching it right away. Big mistake. I thought I will have time to watch it after the baby arrives, but stupid me... You will have no time to do anything with the new born specially with a colicky one! DVD makes it easier to go through all chapters or skip to what is most useful to you, and also you don't have to flip the pages which is hard to do with baby in your arms. Some reviews here said the swaddling instruction in the book was hard to understand but in this DVD, Dr. Karp does real good job showing how.2) Dr. karp's 5S method really works! My baby boy came out to this world crying and didn't stop crying since then!! He came home crying, he cried during diaper change, cried when hungry, cried when sleepy, and at times, cried for no reason! Ok, so I have a colicky baby. It was taking a toll on both me and my husband. We were so unhappy and frustrated all the time. Then I remember having this DVD put away in my DVD collection. I thought, why not give it a try. Anything will help. Dr. Karp not only helped us but saved us. After trying his method for two days, both me and my husband could put the baby to sleep in 5 to 10 minutes tops. Amazing!!! The method is really easy to implement and works almost immediately.3) for my baby, swaddling was only possible with \\"SwaddleMe\\" blanket. He can get out of any receiving blankets no matter how tightly we swaddled him. The \\"SwaddleMe\\" blanket keeps the baby swaddled tight with the Velcro closure. He actually enjoys being swaddled and sleeps way better in it.4) only reason I'm taking away one star is because the DVD/book does not talk about weaning the baby from swaddling past three months. When my baby turned three months, he was too big for the swaddling and spent hours during the night trying to get out of the blanket. I have researched online and am trying one arm out swaddling to get him used to it, but it's taking a while... I ordered no cry solution book to start the sleep training and to wean him off of the sleep association he developed during his first three months. But all this is well worth it because I have the best first three months with my baby.Hope this review helps. Find my review for the no cry solution book to find out the result of weaning the baby from 5S sleep association."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Our child had colic.

It will save you a few hours of increasingly precious time."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The book so far is helpful.

However, the information itself in the order in which it is presented and with the techniques given are priceless. It isn't always easy as 1-2-3. You may have to put a little work in to finally get the baby to be calm, but it will work. Keep practicing if it doesn't work right away. It may take a little finesse.

Dr. Karp acknowledges and explains that in the book. However, using these tried and true techniques together works like a charm every time. The magic is in the combination of these techniques as well as in the specific details. My little one is two months old now. He is sleeping 8 hours a night and is rarely fussy.

I used the 5S to calm her before I read into the details of each \\"S\\" We don't have a colicky baby and I attribute that to this book. Our baby is truly a happy kid. We had to make our own swaddling blankets though, because the pre-made swaddling blankets became too small for her very quickly. She loved being swaddled.

I will buy this and a \\"miracle blanket\\" for all baby showers."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I'm a nanny who deals with an once-upon-time cranky infant. She would cry so much because she could not sleep at all. I thought I had the touch before, but she tried to prove me wrong until I read this book. PARENTS AND NEW PARENTS... READ THIS BOOK!!! IT'S A TRUE GIFT OF BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO SLEEP HOURS IN BED WITHOUT A PEEP! You'll thank me."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"very pleased w/the product I received. It was received in a timely manner and was well informed by email of when to expect it..great service..thanks alot."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Basic, easy to read in short intervals and before bedtime. However, so far, I found it too full of anectodal information and little \\"what to do\\" advice. I've complemented this with \\"Healthy Habits,..\\" and hope to have 2 perspectives to make the best decisions once my first baby is born in 5 weeks."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I agree with everyone who said that his ideas and techniques are great. He does a good job of giving exact instructions on how to swaddle, swing, etc.My only problem is that the book reads like an infomercial. That might not bug some people, but I found it very difficult to get through. There were way too many exclamation points and phrases like &quot;and now I'm going to show you how!&quot; and &quot;quiet your baby in just minutes!&quot; Maybe it's just me, but I tend to think that someone shouldn't have to use phrases and punctuation like that if they have a valid point. It's the same way you're more likely to listen to a calm, nonpushy salesperson than someone jumping all over the place and shouting. It almost makes you wonder what they're trying to hide with all that flashiness."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The pros: the book is easy to read, is straight-forward, and is practical. The cons: there is a LOT of repitition, the book seems to be more geared to calm babies with colic (the title is a little misleading), it's silly that the author claims one must follow his steps EXACTLY, in order to calm a baby(eg. how to \\"properly\\" swaddle a baby), and there is too much anthropologically/historically commentary. Overall, it's a good read, but didn't offer anything more than commonsense calming techniques. (Also, the book recommends a very tight swaddle, but modern pediatricians say that tightly swaddling the arms is okay, although one should not swaddle the legs too tightly, so as not to inhibit the muscles around the hips... to allow for proper motor development.)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"OK, so the book isn't about NOTHING...but it's about only one technique. The funny thing is that I saw this guy on YouTube and watched the technique and had already been trying it out for a few days with my 5 week old. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not. I didn't want to jiggle her so hard that her brains turned to mush...and didn't want to \\"shhhh\\" in her ear so loud as to cause hearing damage. Sometimes I think that she just stopped crying because I scared her with my seemingly hostile behavior...but I admit, other times it worked.OH...back to the review...So, I saw Dr. Karp on YouTube, and then read his website, and I thought, \\"I'd like to know what other secrets he has in his book!\\" I sent my husband to the bookstore to get this fabulous book...which he remembered the author of by calling him \\"Dr. Crap\\". Never before has hubby been so right. Alas...there are no other secrets. All the book says, in it's long drawn-out way, is that Dr. Crap is a genius for coming up with this \\"layered soothing methods\\" idea...and then he creates a LOT of hypothesis about cave people and people of other cultures and the idea of babies being not prepared for life outside the womb when they are born. He makes up crap. He's the crap-maker-upper. Dr.Crap.I wouldn't even be that ticked off that the book has nothing in it that can't be found for free online...except that it was like $15.99. There are SO many other things that I would rather have invested my money in. And the TIME to read it. ugh. When I reached the end, I couldn't believe I actually read over 200 pages that all said the same thing. Dr. CRAP even suggests mid-way through the first section that you can skip to the later part of the book if you need to...as if deep down, he knows that his book is a waste of time and space.His editor should be ashamed. What you see on YouTube is ALL that's in this book. No need to waste your time reading this ridiculous book from Dr. Crap...I mean, Karp."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I received this book as a present. Started reading while pregnant, & did not like this book at all, this book should of only needed to be at least 2 pages, the rest of it is FLUFF. I found the Author to be a bit arrogant in his teachings/techniques. I'm not sure why everyone has given it so many stars, I personally give it a half star. I found for me to not read any more books on this subject, due to the mere fact that, if I can't differentiate my newborn from the family puppy, then, you all have some problems.This stuff is common sense! If you have ever watched a baby before, as in babysitting, then us women should know these simple tasks/techniques (we're born nurturers). First off, they teach us about swaddling in your pregnancy/birth classes, shhhing is common sense, swinging (who doesn't like swinging) my child STILL LOVES it to this day...My child didn't take to the swaddling part at all!! and then sucking, my child took to the pacifier for only 7 months \\"no weaning\\" was necessary for us, she stoped on her own. For being a new parent this could really make you frustrated even more in thinking, why wont this work, what is wrong with my child, or what's WORSE, what's wrong with me. When this Author is telling me this should work. How devastating is that, when it's already hard enough for the first 3 maybe 4 months. I would not recomend this book to anyone. When your baby comes into this world it should be based on NATURAL INSTINCT, not the \\"how to's\\" by someone else. Animals in the wild DO NOT Follow the \\"how to's\\" from someone else!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"First off, let me say that I didn't have my baby yet, so I cannot rate the effectiveness of the method, I'll be sure to come back and update when my baby is born.Now, on to what I can review after reading the book. Negative things first: I whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer who said that this book was horribly written. I had a very good idea of what the book was going to say after the 2 first pages, so 90% of the book felt like a huge waste of my time. He goes over the same things over and over again. It really frustrated me and made me feel like I was some kind of idiot, who can't get what the author is saying the first time around. I also found most of the illustrations annoying and useless (the ones showing the proper swaddling technique, holding techniques, etc. aside). His evidence also seemed a little iffy to me by the time he referred to the same little African tribe for the 10th time. Finally, a lot of the things he talks about mothers do naturally, and a few others are being talked about in more than one book and method nowadays. So, I didn't feel like this book was a revelation to me, and I'm a first-time mother who never changed a diaper.On to some good stuff. He does explain pretty well how to swaddle a baby - something I haven't found in any other book so far. He also gives some pretty detailed descriptions of burping and holding positions and a few of his medical insights do a good job of explaining certain things I didn't know about the babies. If on top of this, his advice works, I'd probably close my eyes to an obvious and somewhat annoying attempt of making a book out of something that should have been an essay or an article and give it 4 stars. But since I haven't tested any of this yet, I'm giving the book itself (not the method) 3 stars, and believe I'm being generous.Overall, I think this book is worth a read for those who've never heard of soothing effects of womb sounds, swaddling, etc. However, I regret having purchased this book - if you can borrow it from a friend, do it, honestly, I can count the truly informative pages on my fingers, as for the rest - read it once if you have an evening to spare, but no need to keep it around and constantly consult it.UPDATEWell, my baby is now 6,5 months old, so I can speak not only for the quality of writing, but also for the quality of advice. And I am not impressed with that either. Of the 5 S-s, maybe 1 or 2 helped us on a few occasions, NONE worked the magic he promises. Being a parent now, I more and more realize that there is no such thing is a guide to your baby. Each baby is truly unique and YOU and you alone will have to figure out how to work things out. So, read this book (I still stand by taking it out of a library or borrowing from a friend rather than buying, once read, you won't need to re-read it to remember things), but don't expect miracles to happen, if you do (like I did), you'd most probably be setting yourself up for a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This is a book written by 2 social workers with applause from a host of pediatricians. I accompanied our son and his wife and baby to Gymboree one Saturday morning and the discussion afterward with other parents. Apparently, there were several couples (from other classes)who found this book very helpful; none of the couples in this class was doing very well with getting baby to sleep in a crib without putting him to sleep first, nor keeping him/her asleep after placing in the crib. This book was recommended to help with that. It's really too early to tell whether it works in our family."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"When my son was a newborn he cried CONSTANTLY and nothing I tried worked. I'll be honest, the info in this book on swaddling and creating the bobble-head effect was great, but the rest was a waste of time. He has this weird notion that babies need to be in a womb for another few months (hello, babies die if they go too much over their due date). Also, he didn't really touch on why a baby might be constantly crying, other than if it was due to colic. Well, my child's was caused by food allergies and SEVERE reflux. Once we figured his tummy issues at 5 months old, he was a little bobble-head-to-sleep addict who constantly awoke and couldn't put himself back to sleep.So, in a nutshell, this is what you need to know from this book: swaddle and create the side-to-side jiggling motion with the head -- this will help your baby go to sleep easily. HOWEVER, BEWARE: you probably will create a baby who is addicted to the bobble head effect and can't go to sleep without it. After you do this, read the BEST book on putting a baby to sleep, which is \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.\\" That book is a lifesaver, and my son is an amazing napper and sleeper. He is almost 3 years old and we don't have nighttime/nap-time battles like all my friends and family with young kids. I credit \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.\\" PLEASE NOTE: do not make your kid \\"cry it out\\" until you know why they are crying and the problem remedied. Also, if your kid was like mine and no acid reflux medicines worked and they cried and awoke constantly, try the elimination diet listed on the Dr. Sears Web site. That was the best thing I ever did for my newborn, who became a new baby once the foods he was intolerant to were removed from my diet. http://www.askdrsears.com/html/4/t041200.aspHealthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The book gives a complete review of diseases and vaccines so the reader can make an educated and informed decision of each vaccine for their child. .

I had absolutly NO experiance with babies, and was so frustrated with the incessant crying for no apparant reason and the fact that no matter what I did it wouldn't stop! After reading this book (my son was 3 weeks old at the time), I tried the 5 S's, and they worked from almost the first time. He did cry while being swaddled, but calmed down within a few minutes.

I purchased this book when my baby was just 3 months old, and screaming his head off on a nightly basis. I tried EVERYTHING. People told me that he had gas, that he was in pain, that I was eating all the wrong foods, etc; basically stating that I was doing everything wrong! If I would have read this book while I was still pregnant, I would have been able to soothe him quickly and alleviated his crying as soon as it started.Dr Karp has great advice that is easy to follow. I now can stop my baby's crying in MINUTES, whereas it used to drag on for hours. I highly recommend this book to other mothers.

After reading so many different types of books that my head was spinning, the combination of this book and The Baby Whisperer changed my relationship with my newborn. Dr. Karp teaches you strategies to help ease your baby from life in the womb to life in the world.

This book taught us the 5 S's, our daughter was calm throught the day and sleeping throught the night in no time. We quickly got rid of her fussiness and colic that was a stress on the rest of the family. We used \\"Babywise\\" in the past, but this book's methods are not as harsh and really focus on calming methods 24 hours a day.

We were pretty low on common sense as well, as we have little to no baby experience. A friend gave me this book and after a week of sleepless nights, we read it. The techniques in the book might be second-nature to some, but we needed it spelled out and demonstrated for us. I found the theories presented very interesting.

For Lucy, the method works most of the time to calm her during a fit. More importantly though, she went from waking up every 2 hours during the night, with crying fits lasting for up to 2 hours before going back to sleep, to now at six weeks old, she sleeps for 4 to 5 at at time a usually goes right back to sleep.I suggest the DVD over the book if you are pressed for time, but the book is an enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My daughter was fussy, but not colicky.

Our 7 week old son is sleeping through the night and all smiles when he is awake. This was not always the case. For the first 3-4 weeks, our son had his nights and days mixed up, and even when he did sleep, it was anywhere from 15 minutes to one hour tops! We were desperate and exhausted.I found Dr. Karp's book, bought it, and have been happy ever since. While our little guy was never colicky, I found that the 5 S's worked magic everytime. I was getting alot of advice from people about not using white noise, pacifiers, etc. because they claimed that they would become habit forming. HOWEVER, Dr. Karp explains the philosophy behind EACH \\"S\\" and then gives methods for weaning them when the baby is ready!!I recommend this book to ALL new parents!!

This pattern continued, with his techniques, until she outgrew her colic around 4 mos.

He discusses his argument, and in later chapters instructs the reader on how to apply his solution to fussiness, which includes basic, simple skills that anyone should be able to master. (Again, I'm a first time mom and haven't yet given birth, so I hope this isn't easier said than done!)I enjoyed the anecdotes he included that describe the care methods of mothers in colic-free cultures. This is an easy read, and even if someone doesn't have time to read the entire book, you could always skip to the chapters that instruct you on how to swaddle, shush, swing, etc.This book is directed toward babies that are four months old or younger, so you may want to look elsewhere if your child is older than three months.

My husband joked about where did our calm baby go? I tried gas drops, colic tablets, just holding her when she cried, vacuums, dryers - nothing really helped completely, just here and there except in the evenings. At about 5 weeks, a friend mentioned how she does the 5 S's or the &quot;cuddle&quot; with the Happiest Baby on the Block book and uses the Miracle Blanket to swaddle her baby. So I got the blanket (awesome also) and the book. Read it cover to cover in a few days while feeding my baby and tried it out and it worked! I don't need it as often as I used to, but I do it anywhere and anytime, restaurants, home, evenings, to get her to fall asleep and it does it! I hold her heartbeat to heartbeat with her on her side and it is nice for me and her so I can shhh her in her ear and be close. Thank you Dr. Karp - I recommend this to everyone as you feel like you are helping your baby.

Lots of his points are common-sense -- swaddle, hold and nurse your baby. But the way in which he puts these together creates the magic. This book can save your life if your baby has colic.

Dr. Karp's \\"fourth trimester\\" theory makes a lot of sense and he supports the case with excellent examples from research and anecdotes from around the world. The techniques and information I learned have given me the confidence to handle my son's crying since day one.

This book simplifies and emphasizes the most basic skills necessary to calm a crying baby and help it sleep through the night (or anytime). I read this book in the last few weeks before my son was born, he is now 7.5 weeks old and I've been practicing these techniques since the moment he was born. He's been an absolute dream from the very beginning...sleeping through the night from the first week we brought him home. These techniques work!!! You can use them all together, or one, two or three at a time. This book is fabulous!!! It should be required reading for all new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We have a 3 month old baby girl who very colicky, often screaming for hours a day and crying fussily most of the rest. We thought something was horribly wrong. People gave us advice that really didn't work. The doctor said we just had to wait it out and to try Milicon drops. Out of desperation, I went to the bookstore and found Dr. Karp's book and read it all in one night. The techniqes he describes really worked to soothe our baby and get her to fall and stay asleep! We were overjoyed. I only wish we would've found this book sooner, it would've saved us two months of anguish and sleep deprivation. I would recommend it to all pregnant moms/couples, even if your baby does not have colic. It would be extremely helpful in making your baby even happier!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book/video gave us very reliable ways of getting our baby-girl to a place of peace and comfort. It was based on providing &quot;womb-like&quot; comforts for baby as she enters this world. Dr. Karp's methods provides concrete tools for caregivers to systematically refer to during fussy and/or transition times. As it is a tool for parents, it is designed for the comfort and mindful nurturing of our sweet new babes in their new and sometimes overwhelming new environment. Our baby sleep 8-10 hours at night at 8 weeks. I just told a friend about the video. She has a 6 week old and her baby was crying/fussy and uncomfortable from 5 -8pm. She called me that night and said it was her first night of peace in 6 weeks. I am giving the book and a good swaddling blanket to all my expecting friends and family!! *K"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book when I was expecting my first child. It gave me hope to know that I might be able to have a &quot;good&quot; baby-one that wouldn't cry all the time and would sleep. It worked! I swaddled my son just like the book said to do and he would sleep for 5-6 hr. stretches at night when he was less than a month old! When he started crying during the day and I thought something was wrong with him I took him to the dr. I was told it was colic. (I thought you only had colic at night-wrong) As he fussed in the dr. office, I swaddled him and held him on his side and put a pacifier in his mouth and he immediately calmed down. My ped. was impressed! As long as you use the 5 S's Dr. Karp describes, you can't go wrong. I'm expecting another in Jan.'04 and I am going to re-read the book to make sure this baby will be the same."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We swaddled our baby from the day she got home from the hospital and she slept 6-hour stretches right from the start. She started sleeping through the night at about 3 weeks old. Fortunately, we didn't have a colicky baby, but are still able to employ all of his soothing techniques when necessary. They work like magic. I will buy this book for all my expectant friends. It's a must have."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Finally a book about infants that actually makes sense and actually WORKS!!! I only wish I had this book when my daughter was born 14 months ago. My son is 2 weeks old and already I notice a big difference in using the techniques from this book. Dr. Karp is right on in his approach it takes several trys to get the hang of it but the 5 S's work once you get the hang of it. I reccomend this book to anyone who's waking up every hour with a new baby. If you can stay awake long enough to read this book you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My mother bought me this book when my firstborn was two weeks old.

My suggestion would be to learn the S's and what they are about, but to really follow \\"Happy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child\\". That is the only book that really got me the Happiest Baby on the Block that I was anticipating in addition to much needed nighttime sleep and naps."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A friend told me about this book and swore by it. I was a little skeptical at first but figured I would give it a try. As a first time mother of a fussy baby with nothing but stomach problems, please believe me when I tell you Dr. Karp's methods work!! The first night I swaddled my daughter, she slept 3 hour intervals at 7 weeks old. It may not sound great but she wasn't sleeping at all!! Then I added the white noise machine and within days she was up to 5 hour intervals. It is really amazing the turnaround she has done. She is smiling much more often and coos at me like crazy. Please try this book if you are at your wits end with a fussy and/or colicky baby. It will help!

I put off getting the book until he was about 2 1/2 months old. I wish I had had it earlier since it was like the book was written for me about my baby. I finally felt like I understood my son better and was able to soothe him much easier. I recommend this book for anyone who has a baby that keeps them up at night with colic. It truly was a life-saver."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I wish I had purchased this book before I had my baby. All the advice in it has been extremely useful especially the swaddling. I did not realise how swaddling a newborn could help them sleep so much better. My baby is alot calmer once I have swaddled her tightly. Her pacifier also helps calm her down and help her sleep.This is a great book and I have purchased a copy for each of my pregnant friends with the advice to read it before their babies are born.I will definitely put the five 'S's to practice with my second baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book while pregnant after seeing Karp's video in a parenting class. I was very impressed with how he calmed babies so effectively and wanted to know more about it. We began practicing his ideas as soon as our son was born and they really did help to keep him asleep for longer, particularly during his naps during the day. He is now two months old and will often start fussing when he is tired. We will tightly swaddle him and he recognizes that it is nap time and will often start to wind down after that (with the help of a pacifier and jiggling movement). Sometimes he'll fuss while being swaddled, but once his arms are out of the way for a few minutes, he calms down. I realize many people say these are just common sense parenting techniques, but for someone who doesn't have a lot of baby experience, this book was very helpful."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I knew absolutely nothing about babies. The first diaper I changed was in the hospital. A nurse in my hospital recommended that I read this book and I am so glad that she did. Learning the \\"cuddle cure\\" has helped me learn how to sooth my baby.

I will be giving this book as a gift for any baby shower that I have in the future."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"As a physician, as well as mother and grandmother, I highly recommend this book to all parents, grandparents, and pediatricians.

A must read for all expectant and new parents and grandparents, as well as other loving caregivers of newborns."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I love this book! I am expecting my first child in just a few days, and the techniques described in this book make sense, are primitive things we should be doing as parents but just forgot how to, and they are simple enough to learn. I am very excited to meet my baby, especially knowing I will have some tricks up my sleeve to make him the happiest baby he can be until he learns some self-soothing techniques. Of course it's not going to be easy, but I now feel confident that I won't have a screaming baby for hours on end! The 5 S's are things parents naturally try to do, but usually only one at a time instead of combining all of them, which some babies just might need to feel calm like they are in the womb. I definitely reccommend this book to any first-time parent and even to those veteran parents that haven't quite figured out ways to help calm their babies faster and more efficiently. Dr. Karp really nailed it on the head with this book, and I am so grateful I found out about it before my baby is born! It's a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After all of the education we sought out during pregnancy, this has probably been the most helpful information.

At 10 weeks old, my baby was pretty consistently getting up twice during the night. I ordered this book (because Mama needed some sleep!) and started employing the techniques -- our baby was sleeping through the night 3 days later! We put him down between 7-7:30 at night, and he sleeps until about the next morning!

Initially I thought it was a little primitive to swaddle a baby, but page after page I was convinced. I tried with my 6 weeks baby and it works! I searched youtube for videos of Dr. Karp and I have found several showing him in action! Definitely I will buy the next one, the happiest toddler in the block. Of course there are no miracles, it is only a tiny fraction of the baby care, but it is great and he explains why!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is the first thing I purchase for friends who are expecting a baby. I was so skeptical about the Steps outlined in the book as they just seemed \\"too good to be true\\". However, a friend of mine had the corresponding video, and when I watched it I was truly amazed. When these 5 steps were used with crying newborn babies, in every situation the baby became calm, stopped crying and usually went to sleep. Babies cannot act, so I knew I needed to give it a try! This book was a lifesaver for our family and it was so nice to know you had a \\"tool\\" to calm your baby and help them sleep (and it was obviously great for new, exhausted parents too)!I started these 5 steps with our son when he was 2 weeks old (along with a routine feeding schedule- every 3 hrs during the day),and within a week, he was sleeping through the night (8+ hrs)! We would go in to check on him thinking something was wrong, but he was snoozing away. We used the SwaddleMe sleepers and he looked like a little burrito in his crib, but with the SwaddleMe sleepers and the 5 steps outlined in this book, with the exception of a few nights when he was sick, we have had long, peaceful nights for almost an entire year now! He loves sleeping in his crib and now at night I just lay him down and he plays for a bit and then drifts off to sleep with his favorite blanket. He is now a truly independent little sleeper.When you apply the 5 steps in this book in the first 3 months of baby's life along with a regular feeding/sleeping routine throughout the day, the results are astonishing.Now, I wish that I could go door to door with new expecting parents and share this with them. It truly works and makes time with baby so much more enjoyable for both baby and mom and dad!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Really, all I can say is that the principles in this book worked for us.

However, I expected to learn something I didn't already know or couldn't google for free. This book didn't offer that. Besides the fact I had to skip a bunch of pages to get to the 'how to' and came to find out there's only one main 'how to' and no other options for different styles or personalities. At least it keeps me from investing in a three hour $75 class on the same subject.

You never expect to have a fussy baby but many parents do and this book will give you some great tips on how to make your baby feel safe & happy.

Before getting crazy, give you and your partner some rest, and your baby more comfort.The book is easy to read and informative. Is particularly useful for newborn util three or four months, because the author starts with the thesis that babies have some kind of fourth trimester (out of your belly)... and they like the shshshsh, sound, and soft movement, being tight, sucking. ...So, good luck, and may God bless you and your little one...

It helps new parents calm a crying baby in the first several months of the baby's life. It tells you how to calm a crying baby and how to get a baby to sleep. Unfortunately we got the book after three or four months, but it still worked great. It's too bad we didn't get it earlier, so we wouldn't have missed all that sleep!I would reccomend this book to all expectant parents.

It was an invaluable tool for my fussy boy during the first 4-5 months. We kept him rapped up for naps and long sleeps for the first 5 and 1/2 months and he would sleep longer stretches than his 1 year old cousin. The advice kept me calm during those long late afternoon crying sessions my son would do. Would also recommend the video, it is easier to figure out the calming techniques through a visual example than reading the instructions in the book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I found this book to be a lifesaver when my previous 'angel baby' started having 3-hour screaming spats when she was 5 weeks old. I followed the techniques exactly as described and it really, really helped calm my baby immediately! It was a lifesaver when I had no idea what our little one wanted/needed. (It turned out she had acid reflux, but until we got that diagnosed...I felt that I had a way to calm and soothe my baby to sleep.)I don't think the book does enough to describe how to truly wean your child off of the techniques. Eventually babies need to learn to fall asleep on their own--otherwise every time your baby wakes (and mine wakes often!) you need to repeat the techniques. You'll ultimately want your baby to soothe herself to sleep...and you'll probably need to get a different book to help you with that."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was a lifesaver!! I had heard about it on Dr. Phil and decided to give it a try. I read the book and tried out the techniques and like magic my son started sleeping longer at night!!! It was the best thing my husband and I ever bought when our son was a newborn. Even though the book says that some babies like the techniques for up to 9 months, our son outgrew them about 4 months. The book really made the first few months easier though. I highly recommend this to any expecting/new parent."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book after reading the other reviews of it on amazon.com. It was my baby's third week, and he needed constant, constant holding, nursing and soothing. Now, that constant contact is part of attachment parenting, so it took awhile before I began to notice and accept that my baby was \\"High Need\\" aka colicky (he's my first)! I have never before reviewed a book, but the 5 S's are so gently effective I just had to write. My baby needs shhh-ing and swinging and he's as calm as limp spaghetti. Now he's needing the white noise machine or music in order to calm in the evening, and it's such a blessed relief for the whole family! I don't mind putting in the soothing time now that I can be nearly instantly effective.

We also paired this information with &#34;Baby Wise,&#34; by Gary Ezzo, and at 8 weeks our baby was sleeping 7-9 hours a night!

Sleep was precious and fleeting. Thankfully, a nurse recommended this book (and the cheesy DVD) to us. We bought both and began using the 5Ss immediately. It's amazing how well those work! It took a bit of practice, but they worked the first night. They really helped us to get some sleep and to help soothe a very difficult to soothe baby. I also greatly appreciated having the DVD for swaddling help. I think we had the earlier version of it - it was cheesy as all get out. He goes over swaddling slowly and repeatedly, as well as the 5Ss. If you're a visual person like I am, I recommend buying it along with the book. If you're a new parent and have zero time (what new parent doesn't?), it's a lot faster to just watch the \\"movie\\" and the movie covers the same basic principles."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book probably could have been much shorter (a pamphlet even) as it states a theory and then repeats it every few pages throughout the duration. Further it provides details on cultural myths and either debunks or supports them if they align with Karp's theory. To a parent looking for tips this delve into anthropology is unnecessary.Fast forward to the wee hours of the morning. I employ all of Karp's methods - swaddle, jiggle, hold sideways, shush, and suck. They don't work. I was stuck with a screaming banshee for hours off and on while I kept trying to employ the methods. According to Karp, if they don't work you aren't doing them correctly. Ok. Whatever.1) Swaddle - I regularly swaddled baby before reading this book. Nothing new.2) Jiggle - Did that too and I think most people instinctively do.3) Hold sideways - This seems to set my baby off. She quiets for a millisecond and then howls louder. I've tried different angles and end up just sticking with her back which she clearly prefers.4) Shush - Again no dice. Baby is not a fan and it certainly doesn't put her to sleep.5) Suck - Until I read this book we had not introduced baby to a pacifier but we had received a few as gifts. After reading the book I used a pacifier for the first time and baby promptly spit it out that time and each time I gave it back.Given that my experiences basically reduce this book to fiction, it's ok."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I am expecting my first baby in 3 months and hoping that I don't need half the info in this book but know I probably will :) It is written in a way that is clear as to what the 5 main steps are to soothing a colicky baby.

Although I won't have a chance to try out the techniques in the book for a few more weeks, I really wanted to comment on the author's \\"history lessons\\". I was surprised to read how frequently Dr. Karp refers to \\"cavebabies\\" and such... so much that I found it laughable! I'm not going to go on and on, I just can't help but to think he sounds somewhat ignorant whenever this creeps into his book, especially when he suggests that babies have learned to cry louder and louder over millions of years. Imagine that, newborn babies can learn such a thing while still in the womb... silly and inconceivable.

The techniques listed in this book work, we never had a problem with calming or soothing our daughter. She was more of a swaddle baby & in fact still loves to be swaddled at night. (The miracle blanket works wonders, as well). Unfortunately, it only goes through the \\"fourth trimester\\" or rather the first 3 months of life. After that, I would highly recommend the \\"No cry, Sleep Solution\\", which I am currently reading for older infants & toddlers. My advice is to get your baby on a naptime & bedtime routine as early as possible- it will save you plenty of sleepless nights & an overtired, cranky baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I thought this book was excellent. I plan to get it for everyone I know that is a first time parent. Dr. Karp's strategies worked exactly as discribed in his book. I also thought that he had a very balanced outlook on raising babies. If you are a co-sleeper that is with your baby 24/7 or if being a working mom (or dad) works better for your family, this book has great strategies for every type of family."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"For all you expecting and new parents I have only 4 words for you, BUY THIS BOOK NOW.We have a four-month-old son and I have read or attempted to read every newborn book written. Dr. Karp's book was the only one that truly made a difference in helping to get our son to sleep longer and teach us how to soothe him like experts. Even better is that the book is so very enjoyable to read and had us laughing the entire time. It is so difficult as a new parent to concentrate and focus on a baby care book and Dr. Karp's book was such fun to read and at the same time so unbelievably helpful. Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr. Karp!!!!

This book spells out what to do when you have run out of ideas-and that certainly will happen! We have modeled our parenting by these books (and Babywise) and we have a very happy, well-rested and confident little girl."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My beautifl baby girl changed at 5 weeks old. She cried for hours every day. She was diagnosed as a sensitive baby with Colic and Reflux. I was given this book as a present and had heard wonderful things about it but I thought that nothing in a book would help me now. I was wrong! I read the book and tried the 5 S's. They really worked. I even bought the video for my husband because I knew he would never read the book. It helped to see his ideas in action. Dr Karp helped me to find the position that was most comfortable for our daughter. I ended up having to hold her for 2 hours each evening but it was better than having her scream. It was really amazing to see her suddenly relax in my arms. She is 15 weeks old now and rarely needs the 5 S's anymore."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was given to me by a friend when my son was a few months old. At first I was skeptical because I'm not usually one to read \\"self-help\\" books, but after only a few pages, I was hooked. Dr. Karp is great! I love his philosophy and his approach to babies. Now that my son is about to turn one, I just started reading \\"The Happiest Toddler On The Block\\" and I'm loving that one too!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Our labor coach went to a lecture given by Dr. Karp. There were many crying babies in the audience and from where he was sitting, using the microphone, he was able to get ALL the babies to stop crying. We went out and bought the book right away. While our daughter didn't have colic, the tools in the book were the easiest way to calm her and put her to sleep. She loved to be swaddled and at over a year, we still use techniques from this book to soothe her. The steps for calming a crying baby are very simple to follow and remember. I could go on forever about how much I feel that this book should be a staple in every childcare library."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I had our first baby and totally recognized we did not know our ear from our elbow as far as newborns were concerned. We got him home and after 2 days of floundering to calm him, we promptly read through Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby book. Not only is it a quick read, but the 5-Ss (the 5 things your do to calm a baby) were unbelievably successful. Our son is now 6 months old and a \\"graduate\\" of the Ss, and I would have to say we definitely have the happiest baby on the block!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I have a 5 week old baby, and were lucky enough to have discovered this book and DVD before we even left for the hospital.

The advice given is nothing more than what our pediatrician said to us, and a little common sense mixed in - definitely nothing revolutionary and certainly not worth wading through the stuff about the lost fourth trimester. Frankly, swaddle and cuddle your baby. There.

The No Cry Sleep Solution is a much better book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book should be titled The Happiest NEWBORN on the block. I would have loved this book when my baby was a few weeks old since the ideas sound reasonable for the newborn stage. However, the suggestions don't work for an older baby. The 5 S's are: Swaddle (like my active 10 month old would go for this!) Put baby on his Side/Stomach (at 10 months you don't PUT him anywhere!) Shhhhh (he thinks that's funny) Swinging (I think every mother sways with a fussy baby, it's natural) Sucking (Oh, he does plenty of that, thank you!) I had to keep searching and luckily found a book for with plenty of answers, it's The No-Cry Sleep Solution, a great book for babies of any age since it also has a newborn section, maybe not as structured as this one, but lots of the same ideas. (Another thing that's rather weird, the endorsements for the Happiest Baby book come from Michelle Pfeiffer (actress) Pierce Brosnan (actor) plus lots of other actors and movie directors. I like movies, but when I want advice about baby-care I don't get why these endorsements mean anything.)"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It just said to swaddle the baby turn it on its side and SHHHHH really loudly in her ear! She loved being swaddled, but the SSSHHHHHing...yeah, kids like loud noises like vaccums and SHHHHing. Shocking. Try to match the pitch of your kids cry. you don't need this video. I can't believe i paid for this thing. It's like a 5 min. video. Worthless."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was given this book when I was in the hospital giving birth at 35 weeks. I thought this book went into far too much detail about the fourth trimester and how other cultures never put their babies down. I basically never put my baby down his first several months and now he doesn't sleep unless he's in my arms. In the western world, where families may live on the other side of the country, the support network isn't available and this method is not practical."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We bought this book when we were expecting our first child. The claims it made to being the fool-proof method of calming a crying baby and ensuring sleep-filled nights were very appealing. I have two points to make. First, the techniques it discusses are very simple and can be learnt in less than five minutes. In fact they are widely described in many books and websites on babies. There is no neeed to buy a book specifically to learn these techniques least of all this one which is very long but starts repeating itself after the introduction. Secondly, I can now say from experience there is absolutely no calming technique that is going to work night after night. Sure, we've tried the ones in this book and sometimes they work. But often they don't. Please don't be fooled as we were into believing the author's claims of instant and regular success - this is complete garbage which is where this book belongs."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"THis book is a good explanation of why swaddling and rocking are important but there is no \\"real\\" solution.

There were many, many references to cavemen and evolution, which I thought very much took away from the truth and beauty of the God-given creation and growth of a baby boy or girl. However, if I am strictly going on the practical ideas contained in the book, they were very good, and I plan on using them as a first time mom. But, as far as other content, and the theories and worldview contained in this book, it was not encouraging."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After reading a lot of positive reviews for this book, my wife asked me to order it for her. We ordered it, and paid for overnight Saturday shipping (an extra $8 on a $10 book).The book arrived as we paid for, but the book is made of really crappy paper, it smells bad, and the print is too small to read. As a result, neither of us wants to even touch the book. It's really unfortunate that the printers have resorted to making books of such low quality."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Received the book in a timely fashion, not in top top condition, but absolutely fine.

SO, this one will work."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is good because it introduced us to swaddling and rocking.The methods in this book didnt work at all with our colic baby daughter.In fact, this book made us feel guiltywhen we couldnt stop the baby from crying. It made us feel obligatedto stop the crying. When we figured that the methods dont work, we threw the book away. All babys are different, and babies NEED to cry. Crying is natural and babies need to experience a full spectrum ofhuman emotions, including emotions that govern crying. To deprive them from crying is criminal, in my opinion.We had to let the baby cry out quite a few times, and her colic gradually disapeared and was gone within few weeks.We have a very happy baby, she is developing extremely well.This book made us initially feel gulty becauseit made us think we were abandoning our child by letting her cry.The book is rubbish, and if you are parents of colicky babys,please dont take this book seriously for your own sanity and for the health of your baby. Just follow your natural instinct and let the baby cry."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Okay...I haven't read this book, but have heard about it from some young mothers. It is my opinion that the book simply states what most mothers just naturally do. Have you ever seen a mother holding a screaming baby without swaying, rocking, bouncing? And of course, it is written by a man, who has never been a mother, and is making a fortune!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I only bought this book when my daughter was 1.5 month-old and she was naturally becoming a better sleeper. I reccomend reading it before having the baby, so you can use the techniques from day one at home. Now my daughter is almost 3 months and I barely swaddle her since she doesn't like it anymore. She does still respond to the shshhhhh sound, so I only use some of the 5 \\"s\\" technique with her.It is a good book overall and it approaches topics as the use of the pacifier, if you can spoil a baby by holding him too much, etc.. I feel more confident in what I am doing as a mom after reading it from a well respected pediatrician."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We purchased the book, but watched the DVD in our pre-labor class at the hospital.

The video shows you how to rock, pacify, swaddle and use a swing with the baby for soothing techniques.We went out and bought an expensive baby swing one of the key tools from this video to help sooth a baby, Our baby hated to swing unless we were directly interacting with her.Our baby also hated her arms swaddled and kicked out of swaddles unless it was the kind with velcro. And if you are breastfeeding it is recomeded to avoid using pacifiers or bottles for a few weeks to avoid nipple confusion, I do not reacll this recomendation by breast feeding experts being mentioned in the video. Even though many of the tips did not work with our baby, I would still highly recomend this book for new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"good mix of \\"grandma's advice\\" and anthropological studies... loved itmy baby isn't even HERE yet, but I've already used the techniques to help my friends little ones calm down! they think I'm magic :)cannot wait to use the info in the book to calm my own little one :)best money I ever spent!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a must for all new parents, especailly the Dad who wants to be the hero at 3:00 a.m. and settle down a new infant, believe me, your women will love it if you can master these techniques and use them successfully."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We did everything that this book recommended and by baby started sleeping through the night within 3 months (but we co slept).

I, cynic extraordinaire, was watching A Place of Our Own on KCET and listening to the all-too-common wails of my 2-month-old when they announced that Dr. Karp would be appearing on the broadcast to demonstrate his methods for the day's topic: How to Calm a Cranky Baby. I was skeptical, especially when he got through The Five S's and it all seemed so Simple. I thought I had tried all that, but then he gave me the key piece that I'd been missing: a good swaddling technique. It made all the difference, and my son loves it! What's more, I love Dr. Karp's reasoning and approach. He described his research as a re-learning of lost methods that have been proven throughout history and across societies but that have disappeared from mainstream care. I applaud him for re-introducing common sense."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book was highly recommended to us when I was pregnant with my first baby last year. The first day, we brought our precious newborn home and she wouldn't stop screaming we immediately turned to the book for answers. We desperately read the entire thing and tried all of the suggestions, but nothing made a difference; she still screamed unconsolably. It left us feeling even more helpless and frustrated. She was eventually diagnosed with reflux, but even after we got her on Prevacid she was a fussy, screaming baby.There were a few things in the book that gave us hope that our baby wouldn't be this way forever, but that didn't make up for the fact that there was nothing we could do in the meantime to make the nightmare end. She finally started acting more like a \\"normal\\" baby (sleeping more, less screaming) around 4 months. I'm not sure what we could have done differently, but this book definitely didn't have the answers for us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The book didn't really add much to the DVD. The DVD is worth every cent."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I didn't find this book until my baby was over a month old; I wish I'd read it while pregnant! The info is invaluable, with simple principles and methods that could have helped so much during those first few weeks with a newborn. I read the book and was so impressed that I rented the DVD from the library and made my husband watch it - the difference in his confidence and success while trying to soothe the baby was immediate, because he finally had some techniques that worked - and worked time and time again! It was such a lifesaver for both of us. I felt relieved that I could trust my husband to know help calm the baby, which not only helped reduce my stress level, but also helped Daddy and Baby start to bond - whereas before, I know he felt a little disconnected and frustrated when only mom/feeding could calm her. I will recommend this book to all my friends, and talk about it often. I can't wait to read \\"The Happiest Toddler on the Block\\" next! Buy it, read it, NOW! And as I mentioned, the DVD is great too - it was awesome to watch Dr. Karp quickly calm babies over and over, using his simple 5 S's."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"If you only read one baby book, read this one! I found out about this book when my son was about 1 month old. I wish I had found out about it before he was born. My husband and I both read this and found it indispensable. It helps explain why newborns do what they do and what it all means. It basically explains that the first 3 months of a newborn's life is actually the \\"fourth trimester.\\" You can use the \\"5 S's\\" to help mimic life in the womb which helps baby transition to life outside of the womb. The first 6 weeks with our son was awful--in part because we didn't understand what he needed. He is now 10 weeks old and life is so good! I attribute it to 1) he's getting a little older, 2) THIS BOOK!, and 3) the Woombie. If you have a baby that resists swaddling, I highly recommend the Woombie. The Happiest Baby on the Block explains why swaddling is so important during the first 3 months. Buy this book and the Woombie and you'll be good to go!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I just want to echo the praise this book has received - it offers up common-sense strategies for calming fussy or \\"colicky\\" babies that really work. Karp's \\"5 S-es\\" approach really works - usually only after the first big S, swaddling.If it's common sense, you may be asking, why buy it? Well, for one thing, it's not terribly expensive. But for another, so many of us have been trained to treat our babies like Faberge Eggs that we refuse to wrap them, rock them, bounce them, or really do anything but endure their fits and destroy our lives as parents. Karp breaks down the wisdom of other cultures and how they soothe their babies, and then, in the most useful part of the book (in my opinion anyway) answers every possible objection that we wimpy Americans tend to raise. Can I spoil my baby with too much white noise? Can I swaddle my baby too tight? And so on.This book should be given to all new parents right out of the hospital. If you know someone who is about the have a child, buy this for them. If you're at the end of your rope after 2 or 3 weeks of shrieking through the night, buy it and have it shipped overnight.In short: get this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have mixed feelings about my rating for this book. The advice contained within has proven quite helpful in soothing our baby. The \\"5 S's\\" are absolutely working for us. Though not always instantaneous, each of the elements Dr. Karp outlines has helped us and I would certainly recommend them to anyone with a newborn.However, I would not recommend that you start at the beginning of the book if you already have a baby. The first six chapters explain what DOESN'T cause colic. And he explains it OVER AND OVER. But they don't help you soothe your crying baby! Start with Chapter 7 and do yourself a favor and start BEFORE your baby is born. I didn't start reading this book until we brought our baby home. By the time I got to the helpful information, we had already struggled through a couple of weeks. This is important because these techniques are only useful, according to the book, for about four months or perhaps a bit longer.Overall, I would say that the helpful advice here is extremely helpful but the book is not well written. Still...hard to say it isn't still worth it to be able to wade through and get the information that will help you soothe your baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We had a baby who loved to cry.

The information makes so much sense and actually works! Some of the 5 S's are common sense and things people tend to do to calm babies anyway, but it's good to hear the science behind it and when you implement multiple S's together it works like a charm."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The techniques we learned from this book really really worked!

They were up every 2 hours from birth to 2 months. I had mentioned this to a friend and she recommended this book. Wow what a difference!! The first night we went back to swaddling they slept 8 hours! I had to keep checking to make sure they were breathing I was amazed.

I feel like this book will help us know how to better comfort our baby and prevent some crying. I found some swaddle blankets online, one that looked really nice and easy to use is called the miracle blanket. We'll probaby also buy some of the summer infant swaddle blankets. You can also get on you tube and search \\"the happiest baby on the block\\" and you'll find videos of people using the techniques taught in the book and you'll see how it really works. We'll also be purchasing a white noise machine."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is amazing! Very good information for those who never thought about how to calm a fussy baby (which most of them are for the first 3 months at least). It seems that most of the classes and info you get before the baby is born only covers the very basics. This book will help you understand your baby so much more and you will be able to relate better to them as well. I have bought this for all of my friends who are having babies...it is the must have gift!!! It is also a great confidence builder when you need it the most."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I already had a pretty happy baby, but at 6 weeks he STILL wasn't sleeping more than 1 to 2 hours at a stretch at night. He'd get up for comfort and for very small feedings. Watching him, I knew he was startling himself awake numerous times each night. Our doctor told us he'd just have to get bigger, better developed and better able to hold larger meals before he'd sleep. Then a friend loaned us this book. I tried swaddling our baby one night at 1 am when I was ready to try anything (he had rejected swaddling at about a week old, so I didn't hold much hope). He fussed for a few minutes, but then fell asleep and slept until 9 am with just one brief waking period to feed. Amazing! We now swaddle him each night. He generally sleeps from about 10:30 to 7 or so, with one brief waking to eat -- and he actually eats a full bottle, no more taking one or two ounces. We also swaddle him on the rare evening when he gets fussy before bedtime. Once he's wrapped, he zones out and is calm no matter what. Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After only two days at home with our newborn, we were at our wits end about how to help her to sleep. A friend gave me this book early in my pregnancy, so I quickly read through it at 3 a.m. and we tried the techniques. It worked like a charm that first time! And our girl slept through the night very early on because of it.I would highly recommend that you purchase a 42\\" square flannel swaddle blanket as well. A good swaddle is the key to this technique. It saved our lives! And we're still using it and our daughter is 3 months old."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The Happpiest Baby on the Block is an excellent book for those with babies ages newborn to four months. Dr. Karp begins by explaining that babies are really born three months earlier than they should be due to the large size of their heads. (The evolution of the human brain is responsible for this.) If babies were to stay in the uterus until they were really ready to come out, they would never be able to pass through the birth canal.With this in mind, Dr. Karp has come up with the 5 \\"S's\\" for calming a young baby's immature nervous system and helping create conditions similar to those found inside of the womb. By learning how to do the 5 \\"S's\\" properly (swaddle, side/stomach, shush, swing, and suck), a caregiver can help their baby become much calmer and sleep better too. Dr. Karp provides excellent step-by-step instructions for doing each of these throughout the book.Dr. Karp notes that other cultures around the world have used these calming methods for centuries, and that the problems of newborn fussiness seen here in the United States, is virtually non-existant in those cultures.In addition to providing excellent advise, Dr. Karp has produced a fun book filled with humor and interspersed cartoon pictures that is really enjoyable to read. I wish that I had read this book when my babies were newborns. I'm sure that it would have saved me hours of pacing the floors at night - especially with my first child! This book is definitely a must-read for caregivers of newborn babies."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My daugher had severe colic for the first three months of her life. She cried from the moment she woke up until \\"went down at night\\" (she really almost didn't sleep. For the first month of her life I spent hours during the night and day rocking her trying to calm her down.I cried with my daughter every day during those hard days.....I felt sad that I couldn't cuddle with my baby and all I could do was having her cry in my arms.One night my husband and I drove with a screaming baby in the back to buy Dr. Karp's book in a near by bookstore. My husband read the book that night while I tried to console our crying baby. After we read the book our lives changed for better and what is more important is that Angeni stop crying and was able to calm down within minutes.I was sad I didn't get the book before. I would had save us many tears during the first month of her life.Dr. Karp is a wonderful person, I met him in a book presentation and I was able to express my gratitude to him personally.This book is a must have book in any new parent's list."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a must read for any parents of a colicky infant. It has helped us tremendously. Our baby used to cry/scream anytime she was awake and seemed inconsolable. We tried diet modifications, gas drops, gripe water and even Levsin, but with no success. We also tried many of the things that Dr. Karp recommends, but in hindsight, we weren't doing them correctly or in combination. Once we put his 5 S's into place our baby hardly ever cries and only for 1 to 2 minutes if she does. I would also recommend the DVD, as a visual demo really helped us (it's worth the money). The book is more thorough and answered many questions the DVD cannot. To outsiders, it appears that our little girl doesn't have &quot;colick&quot; anymore, but once we take away the &quot;Cuddle Cure&quot; it's obvious she is still in her Fourth Trimester. She is just 3 months and we are beginning the weaning process with success. I honestly don't know where we'd be without it and I have recommended it to all my friends with newborns, whether they're colicky or not."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The Happiest Baby on the Block was a wonderful resource for the first couple of months of parenthood. Now, however, my sweet five month old boy is having a very hard time learning to sleep unswaddled. While we were swaddling him, he would only awaken once at night and would take 3 naps a day of 1-2 hours each. Now (unswaddled) he is waking every three hours at night and not napping for more than 30 minutes at a time. Dr. Karp does not adequately discuss methods to &quot;break&quot; your child of this habit.Note: We would simply continue swaddling, but he is learning to turn over and we don't feel comfortable keeping him swaddled when he is capable of that. Also, my husband and I would like to go out for the evening, but none of our relatives/friends/etc have been able to master the art of swaddling."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book worked like magic the FIRST night we tried it. It's really a mircacle. We had tried everything, it seemed, with our 5 week old until we read and tried Dr. Karp's methods this past week. It's SPOOKY how well the methods work and how QUICKLY!! Don't waste your money and time with any other sleep books until you read and try this one.This is a well-written book that can be sped read in a couple of hours. If you buy it TODAY and follow the &quot;5S's,&quot; you will sleep TONIGHT! How's that for results??!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"There is nothing worse as a parent than an inconsolable baby. No matter how hard I tried (hair dryer, vaccum, car rides) I couldn't get my eight week old son to stop crying. He would cry for hours every night. If that wasn't enough he woke up at least three times every night. I bought every book on crying and sleep problems. They either didn't work or seemed much to harsh to try. Then I found Dr. Karp's technique. As soon as my son started crying I followed the 5 &quot;S's&quot;. It took a little practice but within 15 minutes my son stopped crying and drifted off to sleep. Ironically, I burst into tears. Dr. Karp's technique gave me the tools to help my son stop crying and sleep better gently and with love. Every future baby gift I purchase will include a copy of &quot;The Happiest Baby on the Block&quot;. No one should parent without it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's book is extraordinary for dealing with newbornes and his advice is sound and such a relief for parents of a new baby. We followed his advice completely, and our baby never cried more than 5 minutes EVER. The problem is that he is now 3 months old and we still have to use Dr. Karp's methods to get him to sleep. We still have to swaddle him or else he won't sleep. The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is b/c Dr. Karp does not tell the reader how to ween their baby off his 5 Ss. He simply says they won't need them, but it is not true in our case. I am now disappointed b/c I think we will need to teach our son how to sleep unswaddled. Bottom line, it is a great book for the first 3 months, but remember the honeymoon is over after 3 months and you will eventually have to deal with unswaddling your baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I loved this book! It gives step by step procedures of how to calm a baby. The directions on how to properly swaddle a baby has been a life saver for me. Once I was able to swaddle correctly, my baby started to sleep better instantly."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Every parent should be required to read this book prior to the arrival of the precious newborn. Without a doubt our life with our newborn is much better because of this book. I am giving it to all of our friends who are about to have babies. Dr Karp makes it easy for new parents as well as parents who have already had a child to calm your baby and help them sleep a lot longer. And our baby loves what Dr. Karp has taught us."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Our first baby had colic. Before having our second baby, I read this book. Second baby didn't have colic. If I just sort-of kind-of did some of the techniques, it didn't work. When I applied the techniques in this book, my baby calmed down completely."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Wow, why didn't I read this 2-1/2 years ago when I had my frist baby? This book gives tremendous insight to \\"the 4th trimester,\\" as the author calls it, and how to give your baby what he/she needs to be soothed - and to learn to soothe his/herself. His suggestions and techniques to calm even the fussiest baby are right on! Sleep - good sleep - is possible for a newborn! Although my baby was far from colicky, this book introduced the \\"5 S's\\" to me and showed me how to implement these \\"5 S's\\" into her nap and sleep regimen. I am happy to say it works each time - within 5 minutes. She sleeps for at least 5-6 hours in a row and she's only 8 weeks old! I wouldn't be able to write this review if it didn't work, for my sweet baby girl is sleeping soundly, swaddled tightly, and listening to white noise in her bassinett. Life is much better after reading this. Kudos, Dr. Karp! You sure know your stuff!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The \\"Happiest Baby on the Block\\" is my favorite baby book I have read so far. Our son is now 4 months old and we still use many of the techniques outlined in the book to sooth him and help him sleep. I would recommend any first time parent read this book or see the video before their baby is born. I already bought a second copy for my sister who is due with twins in another month."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"All parents should read this book or see the DVD. I recommend the DVD especially for husbands. I would not of made it through the first 3 1/2 months without this DVD. We had this DVD in a drawer and had forgotten about it. We suffered for 5 weeks without it. On a whim, we decided to watch it when I remembered it. We never planned on it working, but it really did. My only problem is what techniques do I use with my 7 month old. These techniques stopped working at 3 1/2 months and the toddler techniques don't start until 1 year old. Dr. Karp please make a happiest baby part 2 for 3 months to 1 year."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I haven't officially read this book, but I did see the author discussing the 5 techniques on Oprah once. I started to put them to use in the newborn nursery and I agree that they all work wonderfully. I now try to teach the 5 techniques to all my new parents prior to them being discharged. It has definitely made my job a lot easier, and parents love it when I can calm their baby for them so quickly."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I stumbled across this when our baby was 6 weeks old. I really wish I had read it before she was born! Since she was already 6 weeks, we started using his techniques right away and we're glad we did. It probably would have saved us a few sleepless/confused nights had we found it earlier! We've recommended it to all our friends who are expecting."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I went through 11 weeks of anxiety and stress with my screaming, non-sleeping baby. This tecnique works when used correctly and with a little patience. I use it with the Fisher Price cradle swing which is great for sleeping, and a CD called \\"Hush Baby\\" which plays white noise, and it actually puts me to sleep too.My baby is now sleeping at least 10 hours at night!I went to specialists who told me not to nurse so often and to let my baby cry, and they could not have been more wrong. Please don't live another day in misery, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"A friend recommended this book to us when I was about 7 - 8 mos. pregnant so I bought it and both my husband and I read it. We are SO glad we did! As new parents, we were apprehensive about how to calm our newborn and after reading this book, we felt better prepared. The strategies really work - we can calm our baby usually within seconds and always within minutes when we use the \\"S\\" strategies. We usually only need to do 2 - 3 of the 5 \\"S\\" strategies to calm her (the swaddle REALLY works - we bought a good swaddle blanket since most receiving blankets are too small - check out www.swaddledesigns.com). I am giving this book to every new parent I know."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, yes, the principles are good. Definitely information about swaddling, sshhhing, etc that every new parent should know.On the other hand, the author presents the material in two incredibly annoying ways. He shares it as though it is brand-new information which no other doctors or parents know about, including ample quotes from parents who herald him as a sort of demi-god. He then simultaneously shares utterly ridiculous suggestions about why babies like these kinds of things. Here's a quote from page 130: \\" 'Tummy touching' might also turn on calming as a reflex left over from our ape ancestors. For millions of years it has been crucial for ape babies to stay still when they were tummy-to-tummy, clutching their mama's fur. It's possible that those animals who were soothed by the sensation of tummy touching thrashed less, and therefore survived and passed their genes along to their own babies.\\"Seriously? That's the best reason he could give as to why babies like to be skin-to-skin with their parent? His continual evolution-based, completely bizarre suggestions contradicted each other and were so annoying that I repeatedly had to stop reading altogether. Perhaps this was Dr. Karp's way of stretching the material to take up a whole book, but it was nearly bad enough to stop me from wanting to read the book at all.The benefit to this book over the dozens that include exactly the same basic principles of baby-calming is that because it has no other real point to it, this book is more specific with details like making sure that your child is swaddled TIGHTLY, that the sshhhing is LOUD, that kind of thing. Instead of just mentioning the techniques in passing, he gives in-depth explanations of exactly how to do it, so that somebody who has never handled a baby before could probably use this book and figure out how to do a very good job of it. That's the biggest plus from my perspective, and the reason that I would - somewhat reluctantly - suggest that new parents skim through it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a life-saver. Amazingly, the techniques really work. Neither my husband or I had any experience taking care of a newborn and this book gave us the confidence we lacked when we took our baby home from the hospital. For me personally, knowing that I can be in control and that there are techniques to calm my baby was priceless. I recommend the book to all first-time parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It's amazing, but this technique really does work. We suffered with an incomplete method before we got this book. We had an out of control, crying baby and nothing seemed to help. My husband and I were at our wit's end, and losing sleep. Then Dr. Karp entered the picture. We had been swaddling our baby, but could never seem to get it right and baby would always get out. We improved our swaddling and added jiggling of our baby and the other techniques and our baby would magically quiet down and eventually go to sleep. Eventually, our baby was sleeping 6 hours straight (and so were we, thank goodness)!I don't think you can go wrong here. Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We were at our wits end with our 1 month old when we cracked open this book. By that point, I had read Ferber, Weissbluth, Sears, Pantley, etc. From the perspective of parenting a newborn, these books contradict each other a lot and aren't very useful yet. In some cases, they can be vague, internally contradictory, and can create more questions than than they answer. This book is vastly different for several reasons:1. It is very focused on the first 3 months2. It presents a very coherent, simple set of tools that you can use to soothe your wailing newborn3. It provides these tools within the context of a simple, powerful concept: human babies are born at a much less developed stage than other mammals, and need to have essentially a \\"fourth trimester\\" outside the mother before they reach a relatively advanced stage of consciousnessAs others have commented, this book instantly build confidence and reduces ambiguity. It also provides lots of very practical information, such as:- It's very loud in the uterus, so crank up the white noise!- Match the child's intensity level with your shushing, jiggling, etc- Don't give up if the child reacts negatively to your soothing at first- the kid's brain is not well enough developed to immediately recognize what you're doing- What's the difference between jiggling (good) and shaking (bad)?-How the $*@!% do you swaddle properly?Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book when it did arrive looked like I had purchased it straight out of a store. Absolutely nothing wrong with it and I paid less than half the price of the actual value.GREAT COPY!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"First of all, I have to say this book has really, really helped out. So Thanks Dr. Karp for your teachings. I've been reading all about the 5 S, and what I like most is how confident is has made me feel taking care of my baby.Even though I like the book so much, I only give it 4 stars because it is somewhat tedious to read. The book has double the page it really needs.I recommend this book, it does have a lot of important info and explanation on how to help you and your baby feel happier and less frustrated on those first months."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Although the tecniques in this book are not some hidden mystery, the ideas work and they are good tools to have when baby is fussy. I can pretty much always quiet my baby by holding him in the crook of my arm, on his side, with a pacifier and shaking my elbow to give him what my husband and I have termed \\"the bobble head\\". The author is a little full of himself, but it is worth the read if only to read other parent's \\"positions\\" for quieting a fussy baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"My husband and I dove into the baby literature when we found out we were pregnant, and read most of the popular books out there. Happiest Baby on the Block was by far the most useful and informative. Caring for our child has been a much more pleasant experience thanks to the information in this book. I am so thankful to Dr. Karp for writing this and allowing us to enjoy the first few months with our newborn, instead of spending the time frazzled and frustrated. Thank you, Dr. Karp! Those of you on the fence, PLEASE read this book!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Great advice for calming your newborn.

This was the third sleep book I tried and the only one that gave solid, step-by-step instructions to get my baby to stop crying and fall asleep. The first night she slept for 5 hours in her crib. Amazing! A must have for all new parents, but especially those with fussy or colicky babies. It is worth any price."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We are so grateful we got this book. It is so intelligent. The auther talks about there being a \\"fourth Trimester\\" in which your baby needs to be close to you. Basically he says that you need to replicate the woom experience for your baby. You do this by swaddleing him, putting him in a sling, etc...We did all of this and our baby almost never cries because he knows that we know how to sooth him. I put this book on the top of my must have list and give it to all my friends having babies."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Saw this book on Dr. Phil when my son was three weeks old. My son was a preemie, so the world outside of the womb was a shock to him. The 5 S's really do work, but you have to read the book and do them correctly. My son was sleeping through the night at 6 weeks, thanks to this book. My son was not colickly in the least, but I'm sure if he had been this book would have helped even more. Colickly or not get this book, and live by it!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"After spending 5 and half sleepless weeks with our new baby daughter who cried and screamed and wailed all night every night we turned desperately to our pediatrician who recommended Dr. Karp's book to me and my husband. After only two nights of using Dr. Karp's suggestions and techniques (very important to do the Five Steps correctly we found) we had our daughter sleeping soundly and happily for 5 and half hours at night. A lot of the information is the same you hear from everyone (swaddle the baby, swing the baby, ssshhhush the baby, etc..), but it is learning the right way to do these things to create the perfect calming effect! I highly highly recommend this book to any parents with a colickly baby - it will save your sanity and also get you some well needed and deserved sleep!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book is a life saver for any parent. I don't care if you're first timers or seasoned veterans, this book is a must! I've recommeded it to every one I know; new parents, grandparents, and parents-to-be. It will be my signature shower gift for the rest of my life. Moms, if you have a husband that wouldn't read a baby book to save his life, get the DVD, it teaches the basics in 20-30 minutes and you won't have to beg!At first you think Dr. Karp is a miracle worker, but after reading the book, everything just makes sense. It's changed my whole understanding of babies. I hope that more people buy this book so there are happy babies and parents all over the world. Thank you Dr. Karp!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Based on my friends' and family's experiences, I imagined that, when my daughter was born, I'd have hours of crying to cope with as part of taking care of a baby. Thankfully, I had seen Dr. Karp on television and bought his book before she was born. From her first day, I used the five &quot;s's&quot;. She is now 22 days old, and, I can honestly say, she has never cried more than half a minute since the day she was born, thanks to the techniques taught in this book.Dr. Karp's techniques should be taught to every mother in the country before leaving the hospital. I've given the book to my whole family to read so that our daughter has consistency of care and can be soothed by any of us in an instant."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have recommended this book to anyone who will listen to me. Dr. Karp gives concrete, clear instructions on how to calm your baby and its works EVERY TIME. We have a 2 month old daughter and I made the mistake of not reading this book until she was a month old. I should have read it before she was born, it would have saved both of us some tears in the first month. But now we used all 5 of the &quot;S&quot; to help her to stay calm and to sleep. Dr. Karp does a great job of backing up his ideas with his own research and presenting the information in an easy to read format, which was so incredibly helpful when I couldn't see straight from exhaustion. Great book, buy it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I bought this book at my baby care basics class 2 months before my daughter arrived. She was a problem sleeper from day one, she had to be held all day long. Finally, 3 months later, I found the book, read it in one day and used the different techniques! It worked!!!!! The very first night my 3 month old slept for 5 hours in her crib. She needed to be wrapped and shushed for a few more months and now at 7 months old she puts her self to sleep and sleeps for 10-12 hours each night without being wrapped or shushed! I still use a white noise machine since our street is very noisy. This book was great for us!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I have only just read The Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr Karp. And I thought that it was too late to help a 7mth old baby. But the swaddling was a dream come true. This along with Dr Karp's 4 other S's has helped our little boy sleep through the night with longer daytime naps as well. I would recommend this book to any new mum or third time mum like me. I will be racing out to buy his new book for toddlers as well."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"2 weeks after my baby was born and the baby nurse left I was left with what I thought was a totally different baby.

She is now 10 weeks old and an angel, we are having so much fun with our little bundle! With this book and DVD I was able to get my baby to sleep 6-7 hrs a night and spend most of the day smiling!

Our daughter was colicy- until 2 months old- which is when we found her calm trigger.

The 5 S's really worked for us (THANK GOD they liked the swings!). Swaddling worked really well for us too. Not all babies are alike, but this book taught us a lot of things about how to soothe newborns very quickly (I was able to read this in the crazy midnight hourse after they were first born and used the information immediately.)

It goes through how to calm a crying baby, whether s/he is colicky or just a little fussy. I don't know how well it works on colicky babies (my baby was \\"easy,\\" luckily), but the principles seem sound. You can tell that Dr. Karp has done a lot of research and his theories make a lot of sense. I've used his swaddling technique on my baby with wonderful results. I can tell he really likes to be all snug in the blanket, rather than having his arms flailing about, and unlike other techniques I've been shown, my baby stays swaddled the longest this way (and he probably wouldn't be able to get out of it if my blankets were the right size).His prose is really fun and easy to read, making reading the book very enjoyable. I love the stories given from other parents and their experiences. Those are fun as well.Overall, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I was a younger sibling and not much of a babysitter. So basically I was clueless on how to take care of a baby. This book was sooo helpful and I am very glad I read it before the arrival of my baby. Newborn babies come into this world and have to adjust to it from the womb. Basically Dr. Karp explains that the baby is doing some serious adjusting during the first 3 months (he calls it the 4th trimester). He gives you the skills to help your baby through this time (i.e., soothe your baby when they are upset). He calls it \\"The 5 S's\\" ~ Swaddle, Suck, Swing, Side/Stomach, and \\"Shhhh\\". Let me tell you, without this book I probably would have been tortured listening to my baby cry as I fumbled around anxiously trying to help him. It is not as simple as making a nice room for your baby and then buying all the best products. Do not expect your baby to go to sleep right at 8pm and then you simply put him in his crib and call it a day. New papents with no prior baby experience: BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book saved us! We finally understand our baby and his needs. Our 7 week old was an uncontrollable crier and although we were doing some of the 5 S's, we did not understand the importance of using them all together at the same time. Our baby has gone from 1-2 hour crying spells to 5 minutes at most after only having the book a few days. We also have hit a major milestone with naps and nighttime sleeping thanks to this book. Our baby went from 3 hour sleep stretches at night to 5-7 hour stretches, again after only have the book for a few days. This is the best investment we've made yet and I highly recommend this book to any new parent."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book did it for my family.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I recommend this book to all new parents. I read this book before my son was born, and it was an eye opener. We all think we \\"know\\" what a baby needs or wants when it's born. Most of us get that a baby will need a clean diaper and a full stomach, but what happens when those two needs are met and baby keeps screaming?The methods that Dr. Karp describes are common sense driven with foundations in science. Before reading this book, it would have never occured to me that being in the outside world is very quiet compared to the noise level in the womb, and that being wrapped up like a burrito while experiencing the \\"jello head jiggle\\" is comforting!!!!This book is a LIFE SAVER!!!! I think it should be handed out at all Obstetrician's offices and in \\"baby boot camps\\"."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book made the single biggest difference for my family during my son's first few months of life. I've seen it make a huge difference for many other families, too, across a broad spectrum of baby and parent temperaments. My son's first few weeks were an incredibly wonderful, but utterly exhausting, time. While I had flipped through this book several times before, it was only when I really read it closely and internalized the advice that things got better. The advice allowed both my husband and I to soothe our son, and it provided the first real sleep we were all able to get after our baby was born. I recommend it very highly. If you can borrow or rent the DVD,The Happiest Baby on the Block - The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep Longer (DVD), I advise you watch that as well -- but it's probably not worth the 20 bucks if you're on a budget. We got the DVD on Netflix.Before my son was born, I heard that the book is full of obvious advice -- a repackaging of stuff that most people already know. Not so, in our case. Within hours after my son was born, he needed to be soothed, and my husband and I found ourselves imitating the \\"shushing\\" we'd seen on the Karp DVD because we truly had no clue other than that. But we didn't have much faith in Dr. Karp at that point. In the book and especially in the DVD, the author seems to spend so much time \\"selling\\" the legitimacy and originality of his method that my husband and I were both instinctively distrustful. In my son's first few weeks, we were pretty sure he didn't want to be swaddled, and we had no inclination to follow Dr. Karp's five steps in order and in combination. But my son was a very troubled sleeper, and at some point in the weeks after he was born, I returned to this book and read it very closely, a couple of times over. We tried the five steps and they really helped -- my husband and I joked that we were \\"Karping\\" our son. We fell in love with theMiracle Blanket - Baby Swaddling Blanket - Blue, theGraco Lovin' Hug Swing, Barcelona Bluegrass, and theWubbanub Pacifier - Yellow Duck. As we more fully embraced the ideas in this book, we were able to get our son to stop crying and sleep in a swing, which gave us a leg to stand on in getting him to soothe himself independently and eventually sleep in his crib.I also really came to appreciate the tone of this book. Before my son was born, I thought it was a little too cutesy for me. But as an exhausted, worried, delirious, first-time mother, Dr. Karp was my best friend. He struck just the right tone: Comforting, reassuring and informative, striking the right balance between giving me advice and telling me to trust my terrific instincts. Even after I had his advice memorized, I found myself turning back to the book, because it was such a comfort.I highly recommend this to all parents. For parents of new babies, this is a no-brainer purchase. I even recommend this, though, to parents of older babies (maybe up to 4-9 months of age) with sleep troubles. We ended up using many of the Karp soothers for longer than the first few months -- we let our son drive the pace, and let him let go of the five steps as he was ready. My son is now one year old and a great sleeper. Baby sleep decisions are extremely personal, but in my opinion, my son just needed extra help sleeping until he was old enough to soothe himself. This book gave me the tools I needed to help my son, and empowered me to make decisions based on my own observations about my baby."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I found this book to be very helpful and reassuring. I am expecting my first child and reading this book assuaged many of my fears about being able to calm and soothe my baby. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Dr. Karp's technique is simple and amazingly effective. After the third amazing night, my wife looked at me and said $5 on the Kindle? It was worth $500. Believe me, this is the book you were looking for."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"It's written a little goofy and not really based on any science or studies or concrete proof, but several people recommended it to me and the techniques he reviews and discusses really work."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"On a desperate day in which my 3 week old son did not seem to stop crying I took him to the local book store for a coffee and a quick walk through the parenting book section. (The only thing which consistently worked at getting him to quiet at that point was a ride in the car and being out of the house.) I found this book and bought it even though I was a bit skeptical. For me it really, really worked.I agree with the other reviewers who say this book repeats itself and that some of the techniques you may already instinctively be doing to calm your baby, but reading the book was still good. I learned a few more tips and also was reassured that I was not the only one with this experience."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Although we have a pretty easy, sleepy baby she sometimes startles herself awake and becomes fussy. My husband and I watched this on the recommendation of the discharge nurse at our hospital and we were glad we did. The techniques on the DVD are very simple and easy to follow and best of all they REALLY work. I mean really, really. As I am writing this my newborn is swaddled, sucking on a pacifier and blissfully snoozing to the sound of the vacuum cleaner. I highly recommend it !"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"The techniques in this book work wonderfully! My husband and I are new parents and our newborn was crying through most of the nights (and days)...she is not one of those sleepy/contented newborns. We bought this book at the recommendation of my mother (an early intervention/occupational therapist), whom uses this book to help the families in her program. We also watched the video (also fabulous!). The techniques take some getting used to, but once down, they are fool-proof and miraculous! Our baby now sleeps 4 hours before needing to be fed at night (after that, she sleeps in 2 hour chunks, which continues through the day). MUCH more manageable than 20 min. cat naps and constant crying!!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I ordered The Happiest Baby on the Block for a friend after reading it myself when I had my child. I read a few books in preparation for, and during, those first few months, but this one, I found the most helpful. It addressed so many of the things I was feeling and my baby was going through--and gave me multiple solutions and theories (not just one that may or may not work). I appreciated all the advice while still reminding me that there are some things that you may not figure out, and not to worry, your baby WILL grow out of it! It also had some humor in it, which is so important when you are stressed out in those first few months with a newborn.All in all, it is a GREAT book that I HIGHLY recommend to new parents."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I read this book almost six years ago during nursing sessions with my newborn...sometimes at 2 in the morning. Since then I have bought copies for all the new moms in my life. It is an absolute must-read for new moms!My husband's parents would cringe whenever they saw us wrap our daughter in swaddling blankets, but we knew it was what she needed and it worked every time. We would wrap her up every night and within minutes she would turn her head to the side and nod off. That (along with a pacifier) would comfort her and signal to her that it was time to sleep. We also swaddled our boys, but they required a little more swinging and shhh-shing.All babies/kids are different and I don't think there's a \\"one size fits all\\" solution to any parenting issue; however, this book is a helpful guide to new parents, filled with ideas for how to give them what they need so they (and you) can rest easier."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We got this book when my son was about 3 weeks old, and it gave us some invaluable tips for helping sooth him and get him to sleep (he LOVES swaddling).

I have a relatively \\"easy\\" baby except that she will only sleep if someone is holding her. As you can imagine, the simplest of tasks is made impossible by this. I've only just begun to read Dr. Karp's book but I've already started putting his advice into practice. Within minutes of swaddling my daughter, putting her in a swing and turning on a bear that mimics the sounds in the uterus, she was calm and fell asleep on her own. She stayed that way FOR 3 HOURS STRAIGHT!!! It was the most luxurious experience since bringing her home from the hospital. I highly recommend this book to all parents.

But after a week, he became colicky. I just got this book today and am ready to read the whole thing. I read the first chapter and its really helpful info."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I recommend this book to all new parents. I have spent plenty of time around nieces and younger cousins, but it is completely different when you watch them for a few hours occasionally 24 hours all the time. My son was born the easiest baby on the block. Even in the NICU nurses would gush on how handsome and sweet he was. My beautiful little girl was born with respiratory problems. You would never know by how she could scream. At 34 weeks they weren't ready for this world. A week after their due date my little girl only got more upset. Through this book we found she has a lactose sensitivity (like my husband), but that only calmed her through the day, starting at 6 pm without fail she would be screaming again. She doesn't need all five s. But swaddling and swinging you can see that switch flip on. When I do the first four in order (she refuses to suck unless she is breastfeeding) she is truly a happy baby! My only suggestion is writing for those with twins. I don't even want to imagine if they were both colic."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"You can get the same gist on how to calm your baby by reading these reviews and the rest are just fillers! Ofcourse, babies are their own unique person, so not all of the information (if any) in these types of &#34;cookie cutter&#34; books will be applicable to all babies. The three things that work best for us out of all the 5 S's are swaddling, sucking, and swaying/rocking/motion. Other than these three soothing methods (which can be Googled), the reassuring tidbit that we got from the book was that newborns NEED/WANT love and affection, so it is important to not deprive them of such simple requests. This alligned with our belief that it is ok to give your newborn the attention, as we do not believe in the &#34;cry it out&#34; method or anything along that spectrum for a newborn."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We are expecting our first child and this book has been so helpful. I haven't used any of the techniques yet since our baby is not due until June, but the theory makes sense and I am excited to try it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I purchased this book as a gift because a very good friend of mine said she'd bought it when she had her first baby and that there was lots of great information in it. I haven't heard back from the giftee but my friend liked it lots."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book worked for our baby! Follow what Dr Karp says and your baby will be much happier, he really understands what babies need."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I think people love this method which is fine. I'll probably use it but it's not worth buying to read. I heard there was a dvd. This book should simply be an article because that's the length of real content in the book. I am not a fan of books which constantly repeat the same things over and over again. I kept hoping I would read new things as I continued to read, but it was the same stuff throughout the book. It feels like they decided a certain length of book sells for a certain amount so just keep adding filler to get to that price point."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Consider this a survival guide if you have an infant. It is well written, easy read and to remember and helps tremendously to calm your infant. we did not have an overly fussy baby, but the tips still were extremely helpful! Especially at night!"},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"We got this book upon a recommendation from another parent and a therapist with a newborn. It was a fast read and many folks have since to just watch the DVD which is on netflixs. The book is a fast read however, and I will probably refer back to it, so I don't mind having spent a bit more money and time to have read it.The book is well written and straight forward. I'm not sure he needs to sell the method as much as he does in the book - after all, you're reading it because you are interested in what he has to say. Overall, makes a lot of sense and hopefully will give us a different and healthy way to bond with baby when she gets here that will support her continued development and transition to life outside the uterus."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I've seen this method in action and it seems to work, so no issues there. The book is very repetitive. But it didn't take long as it was an easy read. He could probably cut out half the pages if he didn't review what he already said over and over again. The DVD is much more to the point and the visual is good, which is why I rented it from the library for my hubby to watch. It was much easier to watch the 40 minute DVD than to get my hubby to read through the book. Same message. The book only gives a little more background information on debunking the &#34;causes&#34; of colic - going through each one and discussing, where in the DVD he gets straight to his methods. While I like the book, I think it would have been better to take out of the library and return. Once you know the info, there's no reason to refer back to it."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I got this book when it was passed on to me by a friend. The first thing I noticed about it is that it starts off like a crazy infomercial, like \\"you too can quiet your baby - it's a miracle!\\" which really put me off actually.One thing about baby advice books (and advice from friends, family etc for that matter) is that no one concept or strategy works for everyone. I think it's a mistake to get too invested in any one philosophy over being flexible for your own baby and family. And of course, nothing is a \\"miracle\\" but just some stuff to try.For this book it boils down to there are five things Dr Karp recommends for quieting babies and you can get the info on what to do for these in 10 minutes in a very small segment of the book. This practical advice is useful and reasonable.The rest of the book the whole \\"fourth trimester\\" thing is basically made up by Dr Karp to add some context and structure to the practical advice and can be completely skipped if you want to skip it. I would say that generally speaking he only uses verifiable facts when stating thing specifically - such as if he says \\"we know babies cry most around 6 weeks of age\\" there are studies supporting that fact. But, at the same time the larger ideas in the book, such as the application of the moro reflex to why babies don't like to sleep on their backs, and other \\"what your baby is thinking\\" type theories are just conjecture. However, as far as I can tell this is true of all baby advice theories and he's no worse than anyone else.So while I don't believe the hype, I found the specific five things to try helpful! So it's worth checking the book out."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"I'm giving this book five stars because the author is a lifesaver, but I watched the DVD version first and honestly, it's the same information in a lot less time! Plus you actually get to see the magic happen. And it is magic. Works for us, anyway.I definitely recommend watching the video or reading this book *before* the baby comes. Those first few nights can be rough, and your newborn is bound to respond well to soothing methods that remind him of the womb."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"Just what a new mom needs are lots of tested ideas on how to deal with an unhappy baby when mom has run out of energy and ideas."},{"Title":"The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer","review":"This book couldn't be more true...I have come across babies and have used the techniques and it worked like a charm!
