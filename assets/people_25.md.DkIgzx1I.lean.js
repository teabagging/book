Many people enjoy Episodes 1-2 just fine, then get to episode 3 and stop dead in their tracks. Just skim through it or even skip it altogether. Ulysses is a book to be re-read, not just read once, so don't concern yourself with Episode 3 the first time through. It will make more sense if/when you reread the novel later. (And you should reread it, because you will be amazed at how easy it becomes once you're familiar with the basic plot).The main reason I'm posting this is to let readers, especially first time readers, know about an essay, \\"Art and Life, Nature and Culture\\" by Cheryl Herr, published in \\"James Joyce's Ulysses: A Casebook.\\" Most articles about Ulysses assume that you agree with the author that Ulysses is a great book, without taking the time to explain WHY it is a great book. Herr's essay explains a few (though definitely not all) of the themes of the novel and why its point is ultimately elusive. Some people get frustrated (I did) thinking that Ulysses is just one big puzzle that can be easily solved if you have the right \\"key,\\" making it seem mechanical, systematic, and just not fun. This essay challenges that assumption, explaining the mysteries of the novel that can never be fully explained, leaving it open to multiple, even infinite, readings.Also, although it's necessary to read \\"A Portrait...\\" before you read Ulysses, if you don't like \\"A Portrait,\\" don't worry. I didn't like that novel very much at all (maybe because I'm not Catholic and couldn't appreciate all the passages about sin and hell, but it just didn't get to me) but I loved Ulysses. So don't let a bad experience with that novel dissuade you, either."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have read Ulysses a number times and purchased this edition for portability. While the product description indicates the edition is based on the 1984 Gabler edition, the Kindle edition includes a number of errors not present in that text. The company appears to have done a poor job copy editing the final Kindle text. There are a number of typographical errors. Also, in many cases numbers are rendered as letters and visa versa, particularly in the final episode. As Joyce often did not use conventional punctuation, it will be difficult for you to identify them unless you have previously read the book.If you are reading Ulysses for the first time or for school or study, you should avoid this edition. Its low price makes this edition is useful for casual re-reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Before I begin, I would just like to say that this is a simple review without any deep analysis of the book or its hidden meaning.Mehehehe. Right, then. What this book is about is.... ahm... eh.... hmmm... one guy's (i.e. Leo Bloom's) journey through the day of June 16th in Dublin, Ireland, accompanied by memorable characters like Stephen Deudalus and Buck Mulligan.\\"Stately plump Buck Mulligan...\\" and so it begins. I won't pretend to understand this book fully. I won't pretend that I caught all the nounces and themes. The fact is that quite a few chapters were incomprehensible to me, although that had not lessened my enjoyment of the book. I would have to say that the most difficult chapter was \\"Circe\\", which I struggled through like a sapper going through a mine field. Most enjoyable chapters, not to mention hilarious ones were \\"Hades\\" and \\"Cyclops\\". For these two chapters alone, this book is worth reading. Hey, I would read anything that would put me back in Dublin. Joyce's mastery of English language is unparalleled and I think he was an absolute genius with words ( a lot of them indecipherable, as it were, but that's okay).In conclusion, I liked the book quite a lot, and would read it again in ten years or so. However, I do feel that this book is not for everyone, especially people who enjoy a quick, easy read. I would recommend at least giving it a try, though. You might get to like it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It puts the beauty of Joyce's language in our ears and animates the stream-of-consciousness narrative."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stubborn persistence was necessary to get me through this book. That's unusual for me because I love reading (the only major book I never finished was Miss MacIntosh, My Darling). My effort paid off, however; it allowed me to enjoy the hilarity of 'Ulysses for Dummies' on the web. For me, Ulysses was 5% brilliantly clever, 50% incomprehensible, and 20% boring. That doesn't add up since I skimmed some of it with glazed eyes. Yes, that 5% made the effort worthwhile, and 'Ulysses for Dummies' was a delicious dessert."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a project, and nobody reads this in a week. Take a year (or 10 years :-)), only this is a must for anyone who reads.The finest example of literature we have."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Incredibly to us, from our &quot;modern&quot; vantage point, &quot;Ulysses&quot;was at one point suppressed in most of the civilized worldfor its supposedly raunchy sex scenes. Today, we can seethat his fiction worked on much higher levels: his portrayalof sex (and other things) is more inventive than Miller's,more subversive than Mappelthorpe's. Joyce's intention is noless than to create an entire mental universe; his novel isa potent artistic answer to the philosophical question, &quot;Do we really exist?&quot;Leopold Bloom, the hero of the story, is a completelyordinary man; but Joyce's combination of words and theproliferation of cross-connections between the current word andthe next illustrate that there is often little connectionbetween *what* we think and the *words* we think. So Joyceis in effect trying to write a novel without words; he wantsto get into the stream of Bloom's thought directly, withoutpreface or interference.Though most would agree that this is a &quot;difficult&quot; novel --perhaps the first book to attempt to break the limits oflanguage -- it is a must-read. Bring the book on a picnic,along with your dictionary and a lot of time. The famousfinal chapter is worth all the work."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce can obviously write, from Nausicca:\\"THE SUMMER EVENING HAD BEGUN TO FOLD THE WORLD IN ITS mysterious embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\\"So, we must assume that he has primarily written Ulysses for some purpose other than to entertain and to provide the kind of pleasure that would be expected from a typical novel. Ulysses is more along the lines of a textbook (in the form of fictional examples) about the philosophy of writing and language, but was decades ahead of it's time. The impact of writing and language on our perceptions of the world appears to be his true goal, with all other considerations a distant second (excepting perhaps the magnificently created character of Leopold Bloom).Ask yourself why you read. If it is for the pleasure of opening up a book and getting lost in it and enjoying the ride, then go elsewhere. If it is to expand your mind on the ideas of writing, language, and reality and perhaps to expand your own writing then this book will be very much to your liking.The best comparison I could think of was with Nabokov. Multiply Nabokov's wordplay and games by a million, but remove most of the the engaging and interesting aspects and the stunningly refined and smooth writing of every single sentence and what you have is Ulysses. But that's OK, because they seem to have had different goals for their writing, as mentioned above.Finally, to those of you who are attempting to read it for the first time and are wondering if it \\"gets better\\" (ie suddenly makes sense and settles down into a typical book once you get past a certain point), it doesn't, it wasn't meant to."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I received a copy of this for Christmas many years ago, but before that I used to have a copy of theUlysses (Gabler Edition)(which is the complete book the way that Joyce would have preferred were it not for censorious typesetters). Comparing both versions, I sadly report that the Modern Library edition is just a lesser work compared to Joyce's true, uncensored vision. Believe it or not, this edition is the bowlderized one...and it still ended up being confiscated due to the Comstock Act! Strange, but true.As a historical document, the Forward is a wonderful reason to buy this version because it says so darned much about the times in which the obscenity trial took place. Just make sure you can get your hands on the Gabler edition as well to compare notes. You'll see what I mean about the difference between the two. But that's only because I'm a Lit nerd. This may be a passable edition, but it's just not as strong as it could have been due to all the mucking about that was done with the original text during Joyce's lifetime."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" has the reputation of being unreadable - or readable only for literature students and professors - but also of being the most influential work in 20th literature. The latter might be true, because most books written afterwards have somehow used the stream-of-consciousness-technique and the non-linear storytelling. Mostly, the book is really about language and its relation to the modern world. Joyce wanted to use a different approach to language to make it consistent with the increasing complexity of every-day-life in a big city. I think that even modern movie experiments such as David Lynchs \\"Mulholland Drive\\" go back to Joyce' ideas to really dig deep in the complicated psyche of an individual, for which traditional storytelling is not sufficient.But is it really unreadable? The book certainly needs some preparation and some effort from your side, more than most other books. But once you are well prepared, the Ulysses is actually well readable, and at most time even a lot of fun. And often you do not wonder why it was heavily criticized at the time it came out. For example, most of modern literature which uses a lot of profanity and vulgarity looks like children books when compared to the Circe-chapter, a sado-masochistic fantasy of the protagonist. Joyce' language skill makes this chapter breathtaking, a pure adventure.At other times, the book is a pure delight, for example \\"Wandering Rocks\\" or \\"Penelope\\". If you listen to your intuition, even the latter (which is the most legendary chapter of the \\"Ulysses\\") is not difficult to read. But then, there are also parts where Joyce' experiment with language fails: For example the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" is just bothersome and really unreadable.As I said, the book is only fun if you are well prepared for it. You should definitely read Joyce \\"Dubliners\\" first, which is an easy to read collection of short stories. It introduces some of the characters which return in the \\"Ulysses\\", and this gives you helpful background information. Even more important, read \\"Portrait of the Artist\\", which is a portrait of Steven as a young man. He has a main role in \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Portrait\\" already introduces a lot of the central ideas of Steven and \\"Ulysses\\" in general.Other books which are comparable in style and intention but easier to read are Virginia Woolfs' \\"Miss Delloway\\" and John Dos Passos' \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", definitely two books which warm you up for the idea of \\"stream of consciousness\\".All in all, Ulysses is an experiment with language which is a lot of fun, but which does not work for all parts of the book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce flaunts and celebrates style in this book. There's a chapter written in the form of a play, a chapter imitating the development of English, a chapter written in question-and-answer form, a chapter without punctuation (the closing monologue, probably the most beautiful, life-affirming thing ever written), and a chapter written in the sentimental style of a girl's novel. There are countless other stylistic tricks, some of which an impatient reader will miss. Yes, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a difficult book to read...but just stick with it, pay close attention, and you'll do fine - and in the end, the rewards of having read it will be worth the struggle. Other more recent novels I recommend are P by Conn, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"My discussions about ULYSSES bring out a similar comment from others--no matter how many times we return to the novel, we find something new. This richly rendered piece proves that virtual reality existed long before computers; it required a rich imagination, a good eye for detail, and a finely tuned ear for the music of voices and everyday sound. We find these things in ULYSSES. It deserves the praise it has earned for these many decades."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that can't be ignored if you want to be considered by anyone to be a &quot;serious&quot; reader, but it shouldn't be ignored. The truth is it is endless entertaining and enlightening. Though you need to spend many hours with it, you'll leave with a lot more than a great name to add to the list of authors you've read. You'll never let it go."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Preface by stating difficulty of full appreciation and fair comment on Ulysses on first reading. One proceeds ungrounded in the various contexts exposed to the author's unique and various styles wherein apparently Joyce attempts creation of reality by limiting his writing to the thoughts and communications of his characters without the crutches of traditional literature. Unknown to me why Joyce chose this particular style, though I speculate he must have wanted to illustrate the irrational nature of the thought process, and perhaps to show off the workings of his own mind. Joyce combines this method with what seems a deliberate effort of obscurity rather than clarity, complexity rather than simplicity, often degenerating into incoherence. He flits about continuously over dozens of subjects within the same page, and most often seems unwilling, or perhaps unable, to bring it all together causing frequent head scratchings for the skeptical reader. But in all this is an author so obviously brilliant that you chug on even when hopelessly lost, always expecting the bells to chime and lights to come on. There are many well done scenes, for me--the first chapter of young men bantering, the classroom in chapter 2, poignant expression of husband and wife relations with bloom and molly in the bedroom, and bloom back in bed after a night of carousing; an ending soliloquy that finally puts women in their place, and could that have been done more effectively--all rendered in writing flashing ability equivalent to the all time best. An imperfect book, but as many reviews note, it is a book on so many levels that generalization is impossible. I will appreciate Ulysses for what I believed it was, which is a lighthearted humorous thought provoking exposition in the style of the author of his own significant gifts."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A stylistically sprawling, richly symbolic, discursive fresco, &quot;Ulyssess&quot; remains the one book that has pushed the form of the novel to explorative extremes. Not to be perused at leisure, but to be studied with diligent effort, it will be regarded as a death sentence by the average reader, but for the genuine lover of literature it's a treat. &quot;Ulyssess&quot; is an elephantine, pedantic, sometimes self-indulgent novel. At first reading, one might feel intimidated by it, which is why student guides and annotated editions are so essential. In reality, it's a very touching and candid book and not as bullying as it seems at all, but an encounter with the most familiar and daily incidents, embedded in the intimacies of lived experience. For all his dense allusiveness and linguistic acrobatics, Joyce's message is so simple that it almost seems a commonplace: the human need to love and be loved. At the same time, though it has been proclaimed as possibly the most individual and innovative novel of the century, one will discover that it's neither individual (with its polyphonic multiple registers) nor innovative (with its reliance on mining pop culture, Celtic traditions, literary precedents -- which were already extant). The really innovative novel of this type was &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I often compare Joyce to an epoch: The Ancient Greeks (collectively), Shakespeare, and Joyce. These are the masters that produce works whose breadth is overwhelming. It is a shame, on the one hand, that a mind such as Joyce's only surfaces every few hundred years. However, it is fortunate (especially for Literature majors and graduate students) that the frequency is so minimal. When I first read Ulysses, I had prepared myself with years of literary training and hours upon hours of reading. The first impression was numbing yet inspiring. In the aftermath of having read the work, I find myself reflecting back upon this work more than any other (this is saying quite a bit coming from a student of American literature). Be prepared with numerous secondary sources, including Ellmann's biography, and expect nothing short of extraordinary for this is one work a reader can never overestimate and one can never relive the first encounter with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, OK, it's always easy to say you don't like something (therefore, you are better than that particular work of art) Having recently arrive from Dublin, the Ulyses experience is understood different: now I can see why Life can happen in just one day. I do not know if it's difficult or easy to read, but when you are more than just a reader but also jump inside the book, and write it together with the author, you are brushed away, swept into a new realm, and sigh: he's right, life is worth it. Do no try to critize the book with difficult words: just live it, and choose who you want to be: Bloom or Dedalus"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is pretty deep water for some of us. I'm more of a &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Stones From the River&quot; type. But the more times one reads this great novel the more one's respect will increase for it. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is so multi-dimensional that you will constantly be rewarded with discovery and delight the more you delve into its mysteries."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To read Ulysses is truly an odyssey. It is an adventure for the mind. The reader is taken to a journey through the minds of three everyday individuals and discovers hidden thoughts, desires and guilts. It is not an easy journey though, as the reader is confronted with obstacles that challenges one's own intelligence and understanding of the story. The book is written in several different ways which will confuse the reader. I feel that when James Joyce wrote the book, he wanted to go beyond just writing a regular novel. He wanted to show us the true nature of the mind the way it really is in a variety of forms. I must say that is was very hard for me to get through the book at times and so I used the cliffs notes to help me. All the characters are excellent and some of them remind me of people I know. It is a book I will read over and over again with great pleasure. I have read many other books and this is one of my favorites. I found it funny how many people were complaining about how difficult it was and how Joyce was wrong in writing it the way he did. I don't see a problem with it. Ulysses wouldn't be great if it was written in any other form. I'm just a normal teenager who simply became interested in Joyce. If I could get through the book alive, anyone can. So for those of you who are complaining, quit crying and reread the book if you didn't understand it !. Its as simple as that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How does one attempt a review of this novel? As other people have expressed, adjectives like &quot;dense&quot;, &quot;complicated&quot;, or &quot;inscrutable&quot; do not begin to convey the experience of Ulysses. I read it for a Joyce course at school, with the assistance of Harry Blamires's Bloomsday (oh...*that's* what happened) book. Reading Ulysses is quite a challenge to the late twentieth century attention span, but if you can get through the maternity ward (recapitulation of the history of the english language) and circe/whorehouse (the abandonment of the rational) episodes, I think you're rewarded with the hilarious, exremely erudite yet still accessible catechism of the penultimate chapter, as well as Molly's freeflowing stream (of thought). On a bookmark I received with an order from Amazon, there is a quote by Elizabeth Drew positing that the &quot;test of literature&quot; is whether or not we live more intensely for reading it. And after my first reading of Ulysses, I'm not so sure...But then, I think I've learned the value of a day..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I first read Ulysses, my friends got tired of hearing about it. Sure it's difficult. Sometimes I literally had to read the book backwards in search of a missing or forgotten thread. One small section is so fiendishly composed that I had to write it out by hand to untangle it. Other parts are as obscure to me now as they were when I first read them.That being said, when you lock onto Ulysses--when you can hold onto the thread--the words, the pages, everything vanishes. Pure thought, like music or cocaine, insinuates itself into your mind and clings to the pleasure centers.That you may never totally unravel Ulysses is unimportant. The pleasure comes from experiencing not completing it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a mystery and a masterpiece. The first time I read it, it was almost a quest of sorts. I had to find something to pass the time during a particularly tedious job that required me to wait against my will every evening for at least one hour. Bit by bit, I proceeded through the text, and found myself entranced and lost in the language. I was a writer at the time, and the attention to detail fascinated me. It also showed me how much I had to learn about language and lyricism. I have reread the book again and again, some sections more than others, and still love it. Every bit. Profane? Hardly. But it has its moments, even by modern standards. Still, the idea of creating such a thing is a thing to be admired."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I informed a co-worker of my intention to read Ulysses, he replied that his grandmother had read it (as it used to be requisite reading) and pronounced it, \\"300,000 words about a man crossing the street\\". That is the sort of dismissal about classical literature that makes me doubly determined to dive in.Much to my dismay, Ulysses turned out to be 300,000 words about a man crossing the street. Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the classical allusions are thought-provoking and on-point. Yes, there is a good deal of lewd behavior and avarice to carry the reader along. Unfortunately Ulysses reminded me why no one writes classical literature any more; its unecessary and outdated verbosity went the way of the Dodo long ago.When I finally reached Molly's narrative I felt like I was a drowning man finally coming up for air, and when I completed the last line I felt I could finally breathe deep. It's not that Ulysses is unreadable; only that there is little reason to read it in its entirety. Find someone who has edited out everything but the dirty jokes and famously coined phrases in their context and read their edition instead. You'll save yourself 40+ hours."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was intimidated at the bulk of ULYSSES, I must admit. But i found myself shocked by it's radiating brilliance. The book is a labor to read, one often has to re-read a paragraph or (god forbid) a chapter to allow the work to truly flow and make sense. Joyce uses beautiful detailed writing of the human mind, all of our peculiar little idiosyncracies and actions that define us as human beings.The greatest feat I've had in my young life is reading the last page and closing the book. You sit back and for hours are confounded as to the brilliance and success of Joyce to write the actions of two characters in a day. Each thought, each subconscious connection and little bits of thinking and reacting are somehow branded into the pages of ULYSSES. I dont think i will ever read such a significant work again. It is bold, it is at times monotonous, at times incoherent, but there are some golden pages were you are sucked into the writing, for the words on the page are your thoughts, your fantasies, your raw human nature.It took me a month to read the book, i read it in the midst of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was able to lose myself in ULYSSES, i was able to walk the streets with Dedalus and Bloom. I was able to sit on the beach and watch the dog sniff around for something he had lost in a past life time. It is a masterpiece while being imperfect, which is an awful lot like being a human being."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't want to elaborate on how hard this book can be to read (I think the other 75 reviews have covered that), but I will say that with Joyce you get out of it what you put into it. Those who love this book rave about its groundbreaking techniques &amp; virtuosity of language. Those who hate this book complain that it is nothing but Joyce showing off &amp; taunting his readers with a book that has no unity or point. This book DOES have a point. All the style in it is only used as means to an end. There are characters. There is conflict (there are several, but I believe the basic conflict is each character struggling with the reality their lives as opposed to what they want their lives to be). There is a climax (and what a climax it is). There is a resolution. This is, at heart, a very sad and haunting book. I think the message in this novel is that we are at the mercy of our lives (i.e. circumstances control us, not vice versa), and that the only way we can deal with the fact that we have no control over our lives is by fooling ourselves. It is a study of the contrast between what we think we are and what we really are. It is saying that the only way people deal with their biggest problems is by running away from them (note the way Leopold Bloom constantly avoids confronting or even thinking about his wife's adultery, and note the way Stephen Dedalus reacts when confronted by his mother; I could cite plenty of other examples). This may be the ultimate truth of life, that we can never face the truth about ourselves. Joyce never states this directly; it is left up to the reader to find for himself. I would be doing this book injustice if I didn't mention that it fleshes out 2 of the most three-dimensional, complete characters in all of literature.This isn't a perfect book: the climax takes place about 200 pages before it ends. I also thought the last chapter, which is probably the most-praised chapter in the book, was disappointing. Joyce apparently tried to create a complete picture of a female character in about 50 pages, when it had taken him 700 pages to create 2 complete pictures of male characters. It threw off the pace of the novel to suddenly get inside the head of a completely different person. Ithaca could have easily been the last chapter, as it summed up all the day's events as opposed to going on to something totally different (which is what the last chapter did).Still, the characters, the themes, and the sheer scope of Ulysses make it as close to perfect as any book can be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I loved Don Quixote, still the greatest of novels. (6 stars!) I loved The Brothers Karamazov, the greatest work of the greatest novelist who ever lived. (5 stars) For sheer reading pleasure Crime and Punishment beats anything I have ever come across.(5 stars) I enjoyed War and Peace, though to me it was a bit dated and didactic and not nearly as convincing and satisfying as DQ, BK or CP. (4 stars)But for some reason after three tries I can't get past page 20 of Ulysses. I find it boring, mannered and well nigh incomprehensible. If it wasn't for the fact that so many learned people say it is a masterpiece I would say Joyce is a fraud. (I read Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man but didn't think it very enjoyable or profound.)Why is it that I can enjoy so many other classic novels yet find Ulysses so repulsive?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is limited to notes on formatting.There is a linked table of contents. All entries in the TOC are in all caps (which always bothers me). But you can jump to any point in the book just fine by following a link.The only other disturbing formatting feature is that there is a blank line between each paragraph in the body text. So with a space = (normal interline spacing + blank line + interline), there's quite a big gap between paragraphs.I think this is required because all the paragraphs are in block indent style (ie, they have 0 left indent on the first line). If you didn't have blank lines between paragraphs, you probably couldn't see the paragraph boundaries easily.Anyhow, there seems to be a LOT (ie, a bit too much) whitespace on each page. I wish they used a normal paragraph indent for the first line, and removed the blank lines between paragraphs."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As for translations of Ulysses, let me tell my Italian friends that Joyce is often hilarious; hope that comes through. (Nel questo libro, Joyce sta scherzando spesso. Spero che suo traduttore non ha tradito, non ha persolo. Alcune delle battute sono stilistica, ma alcuni sono larghi, divertente. Ero un assistente educativo in scuola di specializzazione, e ha contribuito a insegnare in una classe Jocye di Prof Chester Anderson.)I was fortunate to encounter this book after a full, excellent college English major*, so as I read it at leisure during grad school summer, I found it very amusing in the grandest sense. Funny, too. This is a book that benefits from the reader having read most anthology English lit before s/he readsUlysses. Otherwise, one must dive for the footnotes.When one has read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, Ellman's Joyce is also delicious. For example, Joyce received a better grade on his Italian exam than on his English, in official grades when he was qualifying to teach English in Italy (especially Rome and Trieste). He barely qualified in English, but was well qualified in Italian. This gives me pause in an era when we're told that Testing, Testing is the way to improve US Public Ed. This tidbit alone, from Joyce's life, makes one severely doubt it.*Such a major does not even exist now: for example, all of Shakespeare's plays was the standard sophomore English major course, a full year, nineteen plays per semester."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To hold a copy of the original production of ULYSSES is a pleasure. The feel of the pages, the elegance of the typeface, the errors that are inevitable in a work of this magnitude and wit makes one wonder why it has taken so long for a publisher to do what Dover has done. To my mind, it's still the best way visually to read ULYSSES. We forget that when we read our eyes are made to dance with our minds, and to engage our heart in the dance...And Dover's unabridged edition of the original, as it was presented to the world, is a ballet!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The really awful side effect of Kindle is that we are subjected to terrible editions. There's to business model, so the public domain books are only available as prepared by amateurs. In this edition the verse is missing, which ruins even the first chapter.

Joyce was afar-out brilliant unlimited author who likethe great Impressionist Painters tried deparately to paint images and paintings withwords. You either have the patience for Fine Art or you don't !Have fun !"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many scenes stick in one's mind forever, for example when Leopold Bloom releases his bowels or when the coffin falls on the road. I finally came to understand the stream-of-consciousness technique and realized it's not Joyce's stream we're wading in but the carefully reproduced stream of the character's consciousness. I found this particularly effective and fun reading of Stephen Dedalus's morning at school. Other scenes like Molly Bloom's grand finale are simply beautiful and literally breathless, especially if you take punctuation as a breathing signal.And I'm especially glad to read it now that I live in Dublin. I've lived in Ringsend three months, I've visited a friend in Mullingar, and I've shopped at Buckley's butcher shop, all of which are mentioned in Ulysses. I even bought my copy of the book at the Martello tower featured at the start of the novel.But overall, one feels Ulysses is somewhat contrived. Crucify this humble critic if you will, but reproducing the structure of the Odyssey is a clever but artificial way of bringing epic grandeur to what is nothing more than a very ordinary day. Why go through all that trouble? I do agree with the lesson but find it rather long winded. In painting, a still life by Chardin is as realistic as an imperial coronation scene by David, but with much less fuss.And then there are the inside jokes. References to Walt Whitman and to Edgar Allen Poe (which I got only because I remembered Tom Hanks reciting Poe's \\"To Helen\\" in The Ladykillers) and other writers abound. Shouldn't a great work stand on its own, at least where its intended audience is concerned? Ulysses fails utterly in this respect unless we restrict the audience to academics.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can say without reservation that this is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life. It sparkles with emotion and visceral force, thrusting you so deeply into the lives of its main characters that the medium between the reader and the protagonists is completely penetrated and we quite simply become the characters. Asking such questions as \\"well what would have happened if Bloom had decided to do this\\" is meaningless because we know Bloom so well that it is impossible to conceive him doing anything other than as he does it. We are privy to his innermost passions and longings: in the Circe episode we too forlornly cry out to the apparition of his dead son Rudy, his destroyed hope for the honor of his name, his heritage, and his love. In the Wandering Rocks we feel Steven's pain as he is approached by his rag-clad sister begging him for food:\\"She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\\"While some see the parellels to Homer as unnecessary pretentious obscurity, by recreating the Odyssey in turn-of-the-century-Dublin Joyce shows us that all of the heroic epics and action movies in the world are as shallow and meaningless filth before the only true glorious quest, that presented to us in the living of our lives each day.The Homeric parallel also underlies another of Joyce's major aims in the work, that of preserving what has come before. Stephen, the book's other main character, is an autobiographical University student obsessed with the great works of Western literature. Both his thought-stream and his conversations with other characters are rife with allusions to great literature from the ancient Greeks through St. Augustine (the Catholic Church is also very important), Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Flaubert, and even Oscar Wilde. These many allusions are often seen as a reason not to read the book, but I can affirm that while one does lose something by missing them, the book reads quite well without them and often one can determine the significance of the allusion from the context without knowing its source.Essentially Joyce has taken everything that has come before and combined it into a stunning novel that I feel puts him solidly beside Shakespeare as a true master of the English language. Of course when we say the English language that is up to some debate because, like Shakespeare, Joyce in no way feels bound to correct grammar and is quite willing to sacrifice it whenever he feels it hampers his expression.Yes parts of it are difficult, but not so difficult that one shouldn't attempt the book because of them. I have a dirty suspicion that a lot of the reputed difficulty of this book stems from the exaggerations of those who have read it and want to look smart. You will have to do a little background research, and I strongly advise Reading Joyce's other two books, Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so that you know the setting and the people. But that said, go for it! It is more than worth the reward of a little patience at the beginning. Also Harry Blamires' New Bloomsday Book and Anthony Burgess's Re Joyce are wonderful supplements to help clear up some of the initial uncertainty.The book took me almost a year to get through, reading several of the episodes more than once, but coming away from it I absolutely confirm that it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Right. Ulysses. The intellectual field of Joycewrit contains more essays, papers, doctoral theses, and professional articles than most libraries contain books. So much has been written about this book that I usually have to step back and laugh when contemplating the enormity. It is like fathoming the universal end when you are a child of ten.With that said, I do believe I have something to contribute to *this* forum. I can tell you what this book is. It is perhaps the best and most complete example of written reality in existence. If the world exists in a grain of sand, then it exists in a day full of sand many times.What I mean is that the book works on any level. At a closely read level one can find absurdly esoteric references to minutiae that only has relevance for June 16, 1904. The esoterica works, though. By making something obscure that is in essence very simple, Joyce makes one think about it in a new way. Look at Chapter 17 remembering that Joyce's goal is to make the simple obscure. Then ask yourself what happens over the course of the chapter. Never has less accomplished more. Ithaca (ch. 17), by the way, was Joyce's favourite chapter.At a broader level Joyce's expressive mechanism becomes clear and truly rises above any intellectualization. Perhaps you should not worry too much about that passage of Italian shouted in the street, or the odd bit of vaudevillian obscurity. Instead look at the scope and breadth of a single day and the myriad thoughts that pass through your mind. Could someone decipher your day from your thoughts with ease? And as in a real day, as in reality, a man's life is not so simple to pick apart as a speech in a novel may lead you to believe. A simple bit of dialogue spoken to a boaster may reveal a great amount:&quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the opposite of that that is really life.-- What? Says Alf.-- Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.&quot;And that, I am glad to say, is all we get."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses has been called a lot of things, most of them not flattering. I think the reason most people don't like Ulysses is that is is unlike any other novel, and cannot be treated as 'ordinary.'This day in the life of Leopold Bloom holds everything from insights into the nature of existence, opinions ranging from useful to mundane, and observations on, well, everything. Joyce manages to write a book which leads us through the minds of several characters as they live an ordinary, utterly unspectacular day. This technique is certainly unique, and utterly defines the concept of literary realism.To appreciate this book is to take it on its own terms. To gloss over the passages in which Leopold is daydreaming about triffles (as he does, as we all do. And that is the point.) does not hurt the reader in terms of understanding the plot. You don't so much as read this novel, as much as experience it. The reader is intended to be bored when Leopold is bored, excited when he is, and vaguely aware in-between. As one reviewer pointed out, the book is best understood when read aloud. I'm not sure if this is by design or simply because of Joyce's lyrical prose, but it's a good strategy especially in the tough passages.In all respects a classic, even if difficult at times. Influenced nearly everything else after it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Some people like to go for a stroll on the beach. Others like to climb Mount Everest. Reading Ulysses is much more like the latter than the former.I have now read this book four times. I must really be a glutton for punishment.Actually, the rereading is quite rewarding. When I first read the book in my youth, the only edition available was the one with all the printer's errors in it. Those errors made a difficult novel, much more so. So I found that my understanding and appreciation rose substantially when I could read the original version.As I grew older, I realized that I had had more experiences, read more books, and thought more thoughts. That meant that I found new layers of meaning in Ulysses.I plan to keep rereading this book on a regular basis for the rest of my life. I hope you find it this engrossing as well.What initially attracted me to the book was Joyce's ability to capture the inner dialogue that we all have. We alternate between thinking like angels and the basest animals. Joyce not only unveiled and portrayed that quality, he also imbued it with an elegance of expression that certainly exceeds my wit. It is almost as though an intellectual, well-educated literary comedian is invited along to make witnessing the internal dialogue more interesting.Of even greater significance is the reaction that many have to the novel. They simply do not want to plumb into someone else's mind, unless perhaps it is the mind of a saint. But who knows what a saint really thinks?The title, of course, is a dead giveaway (that few will need) that there are a literary analogy and symbolism involved. Those implications are enough to keep several Ph.D.'s busy for a career.Mr. Joyce was a most learned and observant man. What remarkable things must have gone on inside of his mind!If you are interested in extending your own ability to understand what is going on around you, I recommend Ulysses as a way to fill in the backdrop of what is not said when you are with others.If you are more than satisfied with surface reality, then by all means skip this book. You'll wonder what all the fuss is about.Perhaps the only exception to the latter is someone who loves a musical turn of phrasing, something Joyce excels in.Enjoy your journey!If you are like me, you'll find that it makes sense to keep your copy on the night table. You never know when you'll be ready for another trip to 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All the above reviews involve one person reading Ulysses in private, sometimes with help from notes and critics. This was a wildly new way of writing a book, so perhaps it calls for a wildly new way of reading it? I'm in an amateur group in Seattle that reads it together and does a staged reading of chapter a year of Ulysses. Our performances are free so this isn't a promotion! Many of the difficult things about the book are avoided with this method.....for example, it often seems obvious that voices are changing, and that becomes much clearer when one can hear the voices change. This includes jumps between different types of internal thoughts, or different literary styles. Also, the characters seem more real and easier to like when you can hear their voices. Plus, if something seems incomprehensible, you can't stop and perseverate about it during the actual performance.We spend several months reading together and listening to Joyce's prose and thinking about the different voices we hear in it, and researching the bits we don't understand, including esoteric references and pronunciations and mysteries. Then, on Bloomsday each year, the annual celebration of Joyce, but especially Ulysses, we read that chapter in public. The program includes that chapter's key features, a synopsis of the action, the analogy with the Odyssey, the symbols in Joyce's schema and the three or four most important of the intertwining themes within the chapter, and how that chapter relates to the rest of the book. People can bring along their copy of the book and read along.This is why Bloomsday was invented and is the best way to begin to appreciate Ulysses. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps Joyce meant us to struggle, as one other reviewer suggested, to recreate the travails of Odysseus and Bloom in our own minds as we try to understand this book with no help. BUT maybe he actually meant us to read it very slowly and thoughfully, relishing every turn of phrase, every comic and poignant moment and discussing all of the book's references, analogies and puzzles. Perhaps to overthrow the imperialism of English literature which includes telling us how a book should be read!?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I landed in Dublin a couple of years ago and the immigration officer at the airport asked me the purpose of my visit, I told him, \\"James Joyce pilgrimage.\\" He was bemused. \\"James Joyce?\\" he said. \\"You mean 'Ulysses'? That fella?\\" (This moment gave me my first lesson in genuine Irish pronunciation. The Irish pronounce the title of Joyce's great novel with an emphasis on the first syllable: 'YOO-liseez') I answered his questions affirmatively; he examined my passport, studied my face and said, \\"That's a hard book. Have you read 'Ulysses'?\\" I raised my eyebrows in surprise at the question and asked, \\"Will you kick me out of the country if I say no?\\" The immigration officer, still holding my passport, replied, \\"That's a distinct possibility, sir.\\" \\"Then yes,\\" I said, \\"yes, I've read it many times, yes.\\" He returned the passport and waved me through, saying, \\"Enjoy it anyway.\\"I actually have read this book six or seven times by now. When I first read it I was Stephen's age, and now I'm the same age as Bloom. As I have changed over the years, so has my understanding of the book. I still consider 'Ulysses' the greatest novel of the twentieth century, but I can now better appreciate its weaknesses. The \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" and \\"Eumaeus\\" chapters are tedious (the former, in fact, is a failure), but the book's many high points greatly outweigh its faults. And, by the way, it's a COMIC novel, and don't let the professors tell you different."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce is a genius. Let's all say it together, loud and proud. Maybe he is so much of a genius that he has created in a novel, Ulysses, a work that is so far above anyone's heads that since the majority of the reading public doesn't understand, well then, by God, it must be supernova brilliant. Was it just me? Did my intellectual shortcomings not allow me to truly enjoy this work that makes everyone's top 10 books of the century list? Or was Joyce just playing around? A writer with mastery of the language decided to fool around a little and release a novel that is an exercise in experimentation on what you can do with language but nothing really more. To harbor my fragile intellectual ego, that's the theory I'm going with. Greatest book of all time or not, I just didn't get it.This book is supposed to be about Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus and a day in the life of Dublin in 1904. I really had to read the other reviews or cliff notes to be able to discern what happens on that day despite reading the book thoroughly. I know I sure didn't get it from the book. If cryptic meaning, having to read other books so you understand the book you're reading, and spending months slogging through a book is what your looking for in a read, by all means tackle Ulysses. Should we have to labor so hard to enjoy a book? I don't think so. The unique language and wordplay stand out above the rest of the white noise fray making this book redeemable, like a 783 page poem with no plot, if you can imagine enduring something like that.Maybe Joyce, from an Irish heaven, 70 year later is having the last laugh, as the intellectual world hails his &quot;playing around&quot; as THE modern masterpiece. Maybe it takes an English Literary Doctorate and many years to get enjoyment out of this book. I don't have either though, so the enjoyment wasn't there. Joy is the reason I read. I didn't find it with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Every time there's a verb of speaking and a colon, this kindle ebook simply omits what follows. Somebody must've been in a big hurry."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus,\\" noted by other reviewers. Utterly unacceptable for a book written with care to every word."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I went with the Penguin edition because it seemed to have the best reviews out of all the editions available. While I'm sure the paperback edition is fine, the Kindle version is an absolute mess.It looks like this edition was made using OCR and a scanner. Foremost among its problems is that the word \\"the\\" routinely appears as \\"die\\" or \\"lie\\". This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number \\"3\\" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter \\"l\\" is frequently replaced by the number \\"1\\" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies. Since there are several free versions of this book available, I'd advise avoiding this one."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Compared to other editions of Ulysses, this one does not take the needless and mildly obnoxious liberties with the text that certain other editions have--no fancy typography and unnecessary section dividers to be found here. This is (thus far) the unchallenged, definitive edition, with helpfully numbered chapters and the corresponding Odyssey chapter titles in the table of contents. The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the most astonishingly difficult work of fiction that I have ever read. It is also one of the most astonishingly beautiful books I have ever read. Certainly, reading this novel is not for the uninitiated or the faint of heart. But it's also not for those who believe they can understand everything in this book.Certainly a ton has been written on this site about the plot so I'll skip that and just give my suggestions about how to go about reading this behemoth. Find a website that gives you a chapter by chapter summary (wikipedia is not particularly good because the analysis is simply too short). Read the summary of every chapter before you read the chapter and once again after you finish reading the chapter. Also, keep a dictionary handy. James Joyce has the largest vocabulary of any writer I have ever read. I found that this method was sufficient for me to be able to understand a great portion of the book. If I had tried to use an annotated guide, I feel like I would have spent too much time looking at every reference and ultimately given up on the book out of sheer boredom. Literature is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated, so unless you are planning on teaching the book to others, read the book without an annotated guide.For those that are willing to abandon all hope of complete understanding and enter Ulysses, I think the experience is actually quite rewarding. The writing is top-notch, the humor incredibly funny, and the drama incredibly moving. James Joyce said more with this book than I believe has even been said about the human condition in any other book (his only rival being William Shakespeare). It is a work of absolute genius, the kind of book that even the best writers can merely kowtow to in reverence. Its triumph will probably never be equalled and for that reason, it is worth the challenge."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would not recommend this audio version as a substitute to the text, but as a very valuable augmentation. To get the most out of the Ulysses experience, one must employ all senses. Joyce's masterpiece is filled with the music of his own unique language. Reading the text without hearing it is tantamount to reading an opera. Hearing Ulysses read aloud by Donal Donnelly is like hearing that same opera performed by Caruso. The Sirens episode, in particular, is incomplete until it is given a voice. The text of Ulysses is frequently challenging as it drifts, without warning, between styles, languages, and points of view, but Donnelly navigates through Joyce's maelstrom with a confident hand firmly on the tiller. I can listen to these discs over and over the way I would my favorite music, and each time I hear something I missed before or make sense out of something that I didn't understand earlier. An audio companion to the text of Ulysses is invaluable, and I very highly recommend this particular version."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm reading Ulysses and concurrently listening to audio CD's of a seminar on the novel by Professor James Hefferman produced by The Teaching Company.

There is no critical annotation or introduction, so you may consider buying a companion guide or annotation to accompany it (but be skeptical, many published books about Ulysses are misinformed or incomplete). All in all, if you're going to embark on reading Ulysses, you want this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce (1934) is a novel about the interaction of social responsibility and personal desires. It focuses primarily on three characters: Stephen Dedalus a self-absorbed scholar attempting to find his artistic voice, Leopold Bloom who tries to meet his social responsibilities in a culture that is not completely accepting of him, and Molly Bloom (Poldy's wife) who struggles with her feminine destiny.The novel parallels the structure of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" that chronicles the 10 year struggle of Odysseus to return from war in Troy to his home in Ithaca. Ulysses, the Latin translation of the Greek name Odysseus, is Leopold (Poldy) Bloom who travels the streets of Dublin one Thursday on June 16, 1904. His goal is to accomplish his daily task of meeting his family's economic needs, forming social alliances with Dubliners (including Stephen), and satisfying his own drives for understanding and fulfillment. Odysseus sought to reunite with his wife and assess her fidelity in his absence, and Bloom looks forward to the end of the day when he returns to his home at 7 Eccles Street, concerned about his wife's unfaithfulness.\\"Ulysses\\" is remarkable in its descriptive detail of the physical and psychological environments of Dublin and its characters. The feelings related to immersion in the living Irish city are so strong that there may be some irrational fear of being unable to return to current life. The entrance into the reality of the lives of Stephen, Molly, and Poldy is uncanny as readers become physically and psychically connected to characters. It is a matter of proximity. You lose your own personality as you accompany these people when they converse, walk the streets, visit stores, drink and philosophize, reveal themselves in stream of consciousness monologues, argue, pursue bacchanalian extremes, and have private battles with loss and melancholy.The reader \`sees' everything that day, the external locations and the inner worlds of the characters, with the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible.\\" This is the direct and complete experience of Joyce's art without the restriction of our own frame of reference, history, obligations, and wants. It is intimidating to realize that your own life is changing, that part of your personal history now contains a new day of your own existence - you have extended your life for a day. Many people throughout the world celebrate a second birthday on June 16 (Bloomsday).After publication of \\"Ulysses,\\" I believe that James Joyce (like a few other artists) spent the rest of his life amazed at his creation. As he lay dying in hospital waiting for his wife to return to his bedside, he had to wonder where his inspiration originated, where he summoned the ability to give the gift of another day of life to us all.The reader can benefit most from \\"Ulysses\\" by preparing to read it. Read (re-read) Homers \\"Odyssey.\\" Pay close attention to the structure, the symbolic content, and the psychology of Odysseus. Odysseus was a flawed hero, externally brave but also self-serving and blind to parts of his own personality (like Bloom). Use \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford to help guide you through the detail of theology, philosophy, psychology, history, rhetoric, and the physical layout of Dublin. This reference work is very good because it allows readers to have their own experiences by providing only supplementary content (facts) that help to understand the myriad allusions presented in the text. I suggest that you enjoy the many beautiful styles of prose presented in the 18 episodes pausing to quickly glance at the definitions in your opened copy of \\"Ulysses Annotated.\\" Then before reading the next episode, go back and read the complete explanatory entries in this reference book. Give yourself a couple of months to enjoy the novel and add this new day to your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other. Maybe not so great for the inescapable rereading of this masterwork!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's great fun to observe the rancorous--at times vicious--debate this book has engendered among and between its admirers and detractors. Whatever else might be said of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; it's clear that everyone who has read it (and even those who have not) has an opinion about it. But for those who are leery of beginning a book of this size and complexity without some guarantee that it is as &quot;GREAT&quot; as its admirers proclaim it to be, I offer these words of advice: take it slowly, don't get overly bogged down by the unorthodox style, and make a diligent effort to understand what Joyce is trying to say. It's easy to treat his ramblings as the workings of a drunk or inscrutable genius, and to &quot;force&quot; one's way through the book without getting anything out of it. I read &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the first time last summer, without annotations and with only a brief on-line summary of each chapter as my guide, and I'm sure I missed an awful lot. But I loved &quot;Ulysses&quot; nonetheless. The inventive style, the devious puns, the poetic prose--all of it amounts to a reading experience that will reward the patient and persistent with a tremendous intellectual and aesthetic (if not emotional) payoff. While it is not my favorite book of all time, I agree with those who say it's the most important novel of the twentieth-century. It so completely altered the literary landscape of its day that, 80 years after its publication, its effects are still being felt (but not always acknowledged) in the works of contemporary writers.If you want to read this book only because you've been told it was &quot;great&quot; or to tell others you read it (and thus sound &quot;intelligent&quot;), pick up the Cliffs Notes and save yourself some time. If you honestly want to understand *why* this book is frequently cited as the best of the twentieth century, dig in. I plan to revisit &quot;Ulysses&quot; myself in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book designed to make some people hate it, and make some people love it. That's what we all want to write - the seeds of a good debate.Does one need to understand something to appreciate it? I first approached this book like any other - steam through the pages, and try to remember what the story was all about. I found a book which didn't make sense, a book that was near incomprehensible, and I felt frustrated that I could not see what the fuss was all about.I could not hate a book I could not understand, however, except for the fact that it seriously dented my ego. A book I couldn't understand? Never! How dare it??But certain fragments stayed in my mind, and I returned to it again, six months after my first read through.Picked through the text, fell through the lyricism, and replaced the book back on the shelf, where it resided more as a symbol, a badge of courage than a book.And I returned. Again and again. Snippets, fragments, open the book at random, extract. Replace. Repeat.Bit by bit it began to fall into place, the characters and the ambition of the book began to emerge. Bit by bit I began to like it more. I had to stop judging it on its reputation, difficulty or intellectualism. There are sections I love, sections I find a chore to read, and sections I discover all the time. Bizarrely, previously tedious chapters began to come to life, and I began to appreciate them. Equally so, I began to dislike some I previously liked, and the whole balance is always changing. So, I can say that although I've read all the words at least thrice, I have not finished reading the book. And at my rate of a few pages a month, I never will. I hope I never will.Most will either focus on the ambition or the difficulty of the book. There is no need to justify, I think, just read it. There is no need to judge it against any criteria other than yourself; you are the only yardstick any book needs (unless you're an academic, in which case something else is needed). There is no need to redefine &quot;good&quot; over and over again, and justify it.Multifaceted, multilayered, and most of all, strangely human, this is a book I'm not done with yet, and I don't intend ever to be so.That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. It never has ceased to uncover something new each time. The only other book that I can look at time and time again and discover something new all the time is a very good atlas! Well, that's why I think I'll give it 5 stars today. Tomorrow, maybe 4. It changes all the time.Joyce won, didn't he?

Joyce's masterpiece is largely unread beacuse it has been branded &quot;difficult&quot;, but people who make this claim are simply not able to take in serious literature. Anyone who thinks that Joyce has a rival as the greatest writer in history needs only to read this book to be convinced. To get the full satisfaction from this book I think the reader needs to have read the works of Homer frist to understand the greatness and true meaning of the greatest book ever. Forget Plexus, Nexus and all that, forget to kill a mocking bird and all other pretenders, this book is the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses stands as a mountain in the centre of the wasteland of 20th century fiction. It is the landmark that reaches into the pages of every novel written since, it is polymath.But it's a darned difficult read. Each chapter is written not just in a new form, but in a completely new style. It demands a shift in mindset as one progresses through the book. In some cases that shift is required from sentence to sentence, or indeed from word to word.It's not a novel for the casual reader. To get anything out of it, one must be experienced. The annotations do help, but a broad knowledge of international literature, and indeed international language would be a boon when working one's way through the time-honoured pages.Personally, I'd buy it just for the 'Ithaca' chapter. It's pure art (or science, in fact), and in my humble opinion an incredible achievement in anti-narrative that is unsurpassed.Enough sycophancy. Ulysses is glorious, and that is truth."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The last 200+ pages of this book were fantastic, including the night scenes in town. I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Only on my 3rd or 4th attempt did i settle down and finally read this book. I actually saw Joseph Strick's 1967 film recently and although only a fraction of the book makes it to the screen, i found it more informative than any 'guide' you care to buy to help you.The range of linguistic styles, the mindboggling clever plotting, the dazzling knowledge,the unbelievably human sexual passages and above all the spectacular humour are for me all the elements that make Ulysses the definitive vision of how words make up a story that can depict the our condition.All I can say is that I got to Ulysses having already worked my way through the later innovators of the century - Pynchon,Beckett, Gaddis,Coover,Burroughs etc etc and it turns out that almost everything they have said can be found in Ulysses, and Joyce is always more touching, more beautiful, and more anything-you-care-to-mention."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't know if I understood Ulysses as a 'classic' except in the sense that it is an exercise for 'erudition'. Nevertheless, with the assistance of a Cliff Notes edition I was able to go through the whole length of the book and actually understand what was going on. In all, it wasn't too bad.

With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having gotten through \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and \\"Dubliners,\\" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER. For someone with so clearly a gift for language, he lacked one important thing: THE ABILITY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY. Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland. It has no discernable central thought. No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing. But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes? Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see. In reality, there was nothing there at all. Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity. It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.\\"Press on,\\" the professors say, \\"Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities.\\"However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness. The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it. Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read. Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed. Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's. Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine. This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now. To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition? I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend. That is; to trust one's educated common sense. If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson. Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted. And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk.

The point which Monsieur Camus was trying to communicate, I think, is that we should be somewhat happy for the passing of our lives, for it is when we are engaged in the most miseable of chores that we are most aware of time's pasage.I must conclude that Camus never read Joyce, for I am certain that if he had, he would have substituted \\"reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" for \\"waiting in line for theatre tickets.\\" This incoherent, gratuitously allusive, over-long monster of a novel is what English majors have canonized to prove to Engineers that they're smart too (and I write that as a not-too-bright Poli Sci major myself). In the interests of full disclosure, I admit that I have a special hate of this book: a sadist Yallie-Ellmanite English teacher of mine forced me to read it the summer before my senior year of high school.Ulysses has two great strengths. First, it steals the plot of the Odyssey in its entirety--thus, you're not really missing anything by not understanding it. Second, unlike other books in English, it does not discriminate--it it is equally incomprehensible to English and non-English speakers alike--little wonder that the touchy-feelies who dominate ivy league English departments love it so.Lemon soap; masturbate on the beach; stately, plump Buck Whocares?Sadly, though Ulysses is awful, Joyce was not without talent. One can see the glimmer of greatness--great lyrical streches of words, wonderful cadences here and there, etc. This book, however, is the literary equivalent of a Mondrian painting, it is the smug mocking of art(and in certain circles, those who dare to point this out are treated like the boy who observes that the emperor is not wearing clothes).

A novel must be Fun!?!?Blasphemy, to be sure, but even the most heady topics must be entertaining to read, enjoyable to read, fun to read. If not, the author has failed. Failed. Failed. Yes, even Failed.If the great selling point of a novel is \\"I finally got through it,\\" the author has failed. Find me one person who has both: a) actually finished reading Ulysses, and b) enjoyed every moment, and I'll show you a liar.Ulysses is a failed novel because Joyce was a bad writer (shown by his other works). And all the illerati who insist (as did Time magazine) that it was the best novel of the 20th century are simply trying to cover up their own shortcomings of character by trying to appear as that which they are not: literate and respectable.Art is not something you have to \\"get through.\\" It is not something you have to convince yourself and others that it exists in the form you behold.

I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not being an English Literature major, nor an avid reader, I nevertheless decided to read the entire top 100 novels. I would start with the top novel, Ulysses. In that fashion, of reading the best novel first, I could excite myself, that is to kickstart myself, into reading quality material. Prior to this adventure, I mostly focused on the books I could understand, like calculus or structural engineering. Ulysses is far more complex than those references.To ask: Did I finish the book? I must say yes, times one point five. And I accomplished the feat in under three years. After a severe mental breakdown from trying to choke down the book in two bites, I started over after being half finished. I was sure that I had missed something in the first half, so I wanted to return and see what I missed. I searched hard, taking time to savor every word, often looking up words that I thought I may be misinterpreting, But to no avail. But I persisted.I made it through the chapter about Stephen Dedalus for the second time, and was encouraged that more exciting events were sure to surface.Then, through the second chapter about Bloom, I began to get very worried that I would just give up my quest for fine arts. But survived, realizing that I only had several hundred more pages to wade through, to the climax, and forthcoming literary rewards.So I finally approached the end of the novel, reaching the last chapter, paragraph, or sentence, whatever it may be considered, being that it was devoid of punctuation for nearly 100 pages. Apparently it was the authors form of providing the run-on thoughts of a mixed up middle-aged woman, in the middle of non-fulfilling acts of sleeping, half sleeping, dreaming, or other non-physical event.In conclusion, Don't read the book. Burn it hard. Do not let your children read the book---it will mutilate their brain cells. Run fast to the local library and check out a nice text about advanced vector calculus, and a nice bottle of wine.

We all could encounter the same obsticles that mr. bloom encounter thoughout the book.After reading the above one might think \\"so what, don,t most novels do that anyway.\\" This point is true, but many books do not elaberate on events, thoughts, and conversations of various characters the way Joyce does. This aspects makers Joyce one the top tear of all writers throughout the ages.This book also showcases parellels to the adventers in the oddyssy hence the name of the book. this my be a little hard to grasp at first, but as one moves along and perhaps rereads a chapter or two. the reader should be able to see the parellaels in front of him.

But it is also worth the challenge if you want to think about marriage, identity, love, and society in serious ways. If you put the book down half-way you are undoubtedly going to walk away disliking it-the final chapters really tie everything together and the Penelope chapter is vital to understanding the ideosyncratic bits of the text that leave you asking, \\"What?\\"I would not suggest making a go of it without buying \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford. A lot of what he includes is superfluous unless you read the book for school, but it really gives such a greater idea of what Joyce is trying to do with this book, explaining the Odyssey stories for each chapter, stylistic intentions, and illuminating obscure references to Judiasm, Irish nationalism, character histories, food obsessions, etc. Without it the book will probably not have that much meaning for the reader, it's too complex.At first Stephen may seem annoyingly self-involved, Bloom a weak coward, and Molly a tart, but when you consider the themes Joyce is taking on-Irish nationalism, being an outsider, understanding another person in a way that allows you to accept their flaws, etc. their character \\"flaws\\" give way to another interpretation. Especially considering the novel takes place in a single day.The book definitely gets better as you read, so don't get frustrated, the end, while not idealistically upbeat as most novels tend to be, is really fitting and satisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I tried to read Ulysses when I was about 20. I couldn't get into it. The stream of consciousness put me off completely Now I'm over 60 and I greatly enjoyed the book. I could hardly put it down. The writing is beautiful. I just had to go out and get a gorgonzolia sandwitch with a glass of burgundy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had this book described to me by a friend as both the best and worst book she had ever read. I can truly understand and appreciate her sentiments. Parts of the book are sheer poetry, and the descriptions and language draw the reader into the mystical brilliance of James Joyce's non-narrative. Other parts are maddeningly obscure and leave the reader wondering just what the hell is going on. The surprising part of this is that these obscure moments actually add to the book, rather than detracting from it. If &quot;Ulysses&quot; were not so obscure in so many parts, then the sheer mundaneness of much of the day would make it as boring as its detractors claim it to be, but the obscurity forces the reader to read attentively throughout. This is not a challenge enjoyed by all. This is not a light read, and if you're looking for a summer book by the cottage then stick to John Grisham and no fault to it (the light reads serve their purpose and should not be denigrated). However, if you're looking for a book that will test your imagination &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the perfect book. You probably won't fully understand it (I estimate I fully understood about 2/3 of it) but you will have learned much about yourself and the world of early-20th century Dublin and also of the world we live in today. Also, another reviewer here as written that this is a book to be read aloud. I agree whole-heartedly with that appraisal. It will add to both your understanding and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many people see Ulysses as perhaps a pretentious volume of over-rated nonsense which can only be appreciated by intellectuals and academics. This is not the case. By 'the consummation of all literature' I mean that it employs every style of language, every grand philosophical and theological theme. It unites styles of literature like playscript, monologue, soliloquoy, poetry, melodrama, fantasy, heroic, symbolism and makes use of all literary devices: bathos, puns, litotes, dramatic irony, hyperbole - fusing them not only into a story but into an Odyssey. It is the heroic storyteller's heroic story. It's context - modernism - is transcended and becomes what one would hesitatingly refer to now as Postmodern. By that rather glib statement I mean it uses all these disparate themes and unites them via the central character, Leopold Bloom. Leopold is the Modernist man - the manifold fragmented man who asserts a new identity by unification of his 'hundred thousand flaws'. Virginia Woolf tried to demostrate this in Mrs Dalloway by allowing no chapter breaks in her exploration of the semi-autobiographical heroine and thus totalising the sum of experiences. Where Joyce succeeds over Woolf is that he explores not only the totalisation but the totalisation of all relevant parallel events. Like a theorist of chaos, he explores the detail that affects the major life-forces and struggles. The parallel to Homer's Odyssey is emphasised by making the hero's journey so incredibly anodine on the one hand and so completely heroic on the other. Using the Homeric myth of Cyclops, Joyce explores the prevalence of anti-semitism, the Irish religious conflict, the pettiness of argument and theological truths in but one scene. Joyce's work is a classic, not in the way that Finnegan's Wake is - which explores the actuality of language, the song of words and music , but by taking a life in a day and writing about lives themselves and the world they inhabit. It sounds extremely pretentious to say it is the consummation of all literature, but no other book thus far, in my experience, comes even close nor attempts to tackle so much of what Joyce achieves. It is not only that Joyce sees a world in a grain of sand he sees, more importantly, the grains of sand in the world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I have a number of quibles about what Random House/Modern Libary put on their 100 best list, I had no problem at all with what they put first. If I had to pick one book as the best book of the century, it would by Joyce's Ulysses. It's a book I first read about 25 years ago and have returned to it every couple of years since.Ulysses is a rich, complex book that works on many levels. Most people tend to focus on its experimental prose, which Joyce used to both explore his characters and to widen the scope of his novel. But, beneath all of this, Ulysses is a novel of character, a profound look at the human condition. The book experimentation works because it is grounded on the story of Leopold Bloom, who is fundamentally a decent, likeable man. It's also the story of Stephen Daedalus, who, while somewhat of a prig, is a very intersting person, whose thoughts and ideas are exciting to follow.The more I think about it, the more I think that it'll soon be time to read Ulysses yet again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth.

It is certainly not &quot;about nothing&quot;--those that say so are talking about its lack of a standard plot. It's about the relationships people build with one another. Look at the relationships depicted: Bloom's love for Molly despite her infidelity, Molly's love for Bloom despite the infidelity she percieves, Molly's purely sexual love for Boylan, Bloom's fatherly love for Stephen, Stephen's constant searching for paternal influence, etc, etc. Joyce examines in minute detail each one of these and allows the reader to come to his own conclusions about the characters and their feelings.It _is_ a difficult book. Stick through it; it's worthwhile. For me, it really started to come together around &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; (chapter 14). After &quot;Ithaca&quot; (ch. 17) I felt like I'd known Bloom all my life. And &quot;Penelope&quot; (ch. 18) is remarkable not for what it reveals about Molly, but for what it reveals about Bloom.If you didn't get anything out of _Ulysses_, you didn't read it carefully enough. I suspect many people pick it up without knowning anything about it, and I further suspect that many people who read it for a university course are only skimming it for essay topics (of which there are plenty). Get something like &quot;The Bloomsday Book&quot; to help you through it, read something about the book before you start to read it, read it carefully, and read it more than once. That's the only way you can get everything out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, &quot;Ulysses,&quot; we are told, is a work of genius; yes, it is multi-faceted and pregnant with meaning; true, it may even be a compendium of all Western Culture since Homer. But, let's be honest: It's as fun as reading a telephone directory! One risks opening oneself up to the assaults of the junior college-educated parrot, who gleefully repeats what &quot;wisdom&quot; was imparted to him by his talentless and blustering English instructor. But for those of us not interested in posturing; that is to say, for those of us who actually read Mr. Joyce's work--yes, every last page! (and not at the behest of some school-drudge)--we can risk dispensing with the bombast and dogma to whisper our opinions in a voice sharpened with an edge of honesty. &quot;Ulysses,&quot; such as it is, is a bore. Few unread novels have enjoyed as much success. Such fame rests chiefly, however, on the fact that it is usually not touched . . . which, even if it were, it would reveal itself to be wholly incomprehensible--thus allowing any pseudo-intellectual halfwit to attach any meaning to it that he wishes. The truth, though? &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a satire--and a very tedious one--of Homer's wonderful Odyssey. But Homer's work is actually readable and entertaining! Sad, considering that the ancient Hellene is several thousand years removed from us and yet still has the power to spin a fascinating story. Joyce, however, has created--nothing! He borrows, he steals, he imitates . . . badly. For a true original; for a man of genius and an author who can actually write his own plots; one should look no further than Homer. Joyce? He's a pedant and an over-rated, long-winded bore."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and also Dubliners, I decided last summer to tackle his novel Ulysses, to which several literary associations have deemed the greatest twentieth century novel. Today's sophisticated younger reader may ponder the accolades professors and scholars have showered upon a novel that rambles for well over 700 pages, but there are significant reasons that I would like to briefly elucidate.First, as many have pointed out this is a book of language, and specifically one that attempts to import all of English lexicon in order to examine where its vocabulary leads us and where we ultimately run up against road blocks. This monumental task had never been accomplished in the English language since the likes of Shakespeare and Chaucer.Second, this is a novel of experimentation. A 19th century staple, the novel was overdue for an update that would capture the complexities and anxieties of the 20th century. For too long, the novel reflected a mathematical plot line divided evenly into clear physical events, which, frankly, failed to detail the organics of human thought and development. Ulysses does the unthinkable: Our thoughts and actions cannot be explained away by chronology;there is a real-time universal presence to them, as some would later read in Faulkner's works.Third, there is an authentic examination of the individual. Reading his biography and Ireland's history, Joyce repeatedly hammers home the colossal battle between individuality and social conformity. In Ulysses, outside forces such as the Catholic church, parents, ignorance, politics, and peers attempt to squelch the voice of the individual by attempting to dictate what happiness and contentment are. It is through allusions to the mythological story of the Odyssey that our most heroic feat today is learning how our voice can Bloom in a world that too often expects us to conform.Fourth, it is an honest, realistic story about life in general. Whether we want to admit it, much of life is spent within ourselves, as Joyce unearths through the three characters' streams of consciousness. We do talk to ourselves; our thoughts are random, not linear; we scrutinize ourselves hoping to make connections among scraps of thoughts that only we and God have access to. No novelist up to this point had created what amounted to a confessional that was unafraid of society's taboos and mores. Where else could a young modern reader, for example, read about a character's sexual acts in unadorned detail?Finally, contrary to what critics have stated--i.e. several novelists of Joyce's age called the work a mess--there is a compelling story. At the time of its publication, virulent anti-semitism consumed not only colonized Ireland but the rest of the world. So enters our modern day Ulysses, Bloom, a baptized Jew who exhibits the attributes of Christ but is condemned by his society for alleged ancestral sins. And then there is poor Stephen, whose triumphant announcement to the world that he is an artist contrasts sharply with his doldrum existence, refusing to pray for his dying mother, rejecting his largely absent father, and holding a teaching position that is less than inspiring.There's Molly, a singer by trade who is blazed into sleeping with a talent agent so that she can further her career and can also help provide for Bloom when money is tight. Molly and Bloom may be jovial in name, but underneath is the tragic loss of their infant son who managed to live only eleven days. To me, this is an unflinching look at real life. And yet, epiphanies still happen, and new friendships such as what Stephen and Bloom display provide us with what really matters most: love and acceptance. Bloom is the father who unconditionally accepts Stephen, and Stephen is the son Bloom has dreamed of since Stephen clearly needs guidance.Many readers have pointed out that the traditional literary community has hailed Ulysses as the seminal novel of the twentieth century, and, therefore, today's reader must adhere to its proclamation. If Joyce were alive, I think he would be appalled simply because freedom of expression was his guiding principle. Joyce's main point is that the path toward freedom is not merely a straight line or even a winding one; rather, it is a confluence of thoughts, feelings, and relationships that eventually crystallize into an overarching personal epiphany. Ulysses certainly is a challenge, but then again so is life. Each day is worth a seven hundred page book--Joyce's merit is that he actually proved it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Unfortunately, the first edition of *Ulysses* to be published in Dublin is not the edition of this book which anyone should read first. Danis Rose's decisions to normalize punctuation and spelling, to make intrusions into Joyce's prose on the basis of his own criteria of syntactic and semantic coherence rather than on textual evidence, and to re-insert apostrophes into Penelope (although he prints an alternate version of the chapter in an appendix) are only barely justifiable in terms of his own theory of editing -- and entirely alien to the &quot;normal&quot; practices of scholarly textual critics. This is quite a shame, because some of Rose's work on the manuscript evidence (as it is described in his introduction, quite interesting in itself) might potentially be of great importance to the textual study of *Ulysses*. Without an apparatus criticus, however, no one can tell for sure. Although (as Rose himself points out) there is and can be no absolutely &quot;definitive&quot; *Ulysses*, there are better places to start. Read Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition, keeping in mind its limitations (or, if you want a student's edition with good notes in the volume, use the reprint of the 1922 first edition, edited by Jeri Johnson for OUP, taking care to check out some of the more important alternate readings in Gabler's text). For those interested, a forthcoming issue of *James Joyce Quarterly* will include extensive discussion of Rose's edition and its merits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think Jonathan Franzen had it about right when he compared Ulysses to a great, Old World Cathedral packed full of iconography. Tourists wander in, snuffle about, pick up the odd snippet that they find aesthetically pleasing without ever coming close to comprehending the depth of the whole thing; then there are the fanatics who consult with the priestly critics who can comprehend its mysteries. On top of this the state certifies the thing as great art (Ulysses is a huge national institution in Ireland - it has spawned a great Joyce industry (even though he lived most of his life as an exile from Ireland) and the 100th anniversary of the day on which Ulysses is set was marked by native Dubliners parading round the streets in stockings and boaters).Ulysses is a hugely difficult book (though not as bad as the impossible Finnegan's Wake), made doubly so by the fact that it is so reader unfriendly. I suspect most people read Ulysses because they have heard it is the ultimate literary challenge, plough through it with some difficulty, skimming large parts, picking up the odd stylistic triumph that keeps them going, then breathe a huge sigh of relief when they have finished it.If you still insist on reading Ulysses, I recommend 'The New Bloomsday Book' by Harry Blamires which offers a page by page readers guide to the book's contents. But really, unless you devote months of scholarship and read a multitude of supplementary texts, you won't fully grasp what is really going on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This version is NOT annotated, in spite of the claim. The book itself is of course a classic of literature in the English language...but do not expect any annotations (and this is a book which would be much helped by annotations)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is in the eyes of most literary critics the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and a major addition to the Western literary Tradition. So much has been said about it in so many ways that I will free to chip in my less than two cents without doing the reviewer's ordinary task of describing the work, and telling the reader what it is all about. Bloomsday is a day on the literary calendar of the world. And Daedalaus, and Leopold Bloom and Molly are with K. and Falstaff, and Sancho and Pickwick in the cast of world - literary creations whose image is part of the collective human consciousness generation to generation as most real human beings are not.Ulysses is not easy to read even if one takes a Gilbert Stuart or some other modern guide , and figures out what each section with its own separate style, technique, theme parallel in the Odyssey is all about. And there are parts and not simply small parts which bore in their incomprehensibility as only Finnegans Wake will exceed. But there are also, and this is all through the work great lyrical passages of course culminating in Molly Blooms yes I said I will yes. There is too I suppose the particular pleasure of trying to figure out all these literary mysteries and these hidden hints in the multi- layered language of the text. Already Joyce here is moving toward the creation of his own language and the portmanteau and pun principles are richly at work. In Oxen of the Sun he writes the history of the English language parodying its styles. And the whole theme of parodying rewriting alluding to the great work, and somehow superseding it are in the frame of the work ( Before Bloom and before Daedalus there was a real Ulysses) Joyce's effort to write in one day the whole of human experience and to make too of the form of catalogue encyclopedia a higher way to art is part also of the transformation of popular forms into the highest art forms. Shakespeare did it on many levels and so must Joyce, as Hamlet Daedalaus reminds it. Ulysses at publication time was revolutionary to many in its putting on the page the lusts and obscenities , the sexual thoughts and even ' experiences' of its characters. It too broke the frame of convention in a whole host of other ways including through the shifting centers of its narrative consciouosness- the way it tells and does not tell its story. The sheer lyric musical beauty of Joyce's prose is poetry at its best .And the epiphanies on oval leaves are revelations of the beauty in language itself its sheer joyful joycean playing. And how can I having read through with dismay so much of the hidden and not so hidden anti- Jewish character of so many in the Tradition not be hearted by the warm feeling which flows toward the good souled Leopold Bloom. If I were to complain about graduate school time reading through the longest longeurs in Joyce I would nonetheless always keep in mind that one wee bit of an Irishladdie allalone went out there and by himself only made a masterpiece all mankind can make its own by reading and rereading before running on to riverun from bend of bay to swerve of shore past Howth Castle and environs"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I run these Donal Donnely disks continually just for the sheer joy of the language. This story, as any IRish tale, is from an oral tradition untamed by the printed word. It must be heard and sung, just as John Jameson and sons must be sniffed and savored, rather than read. Each sentence and paragraph (especially in the Cyclops section) requires a different narrative voice, which Donal does masterfully, even the \\"suppressed rancor\\" of the dog's poem requesting a dish of water!I find the disk nineteen the most important point for understanding the message and and meaning of this great misunderstand novel. Please supplement with Schwarz's Reading Joyce's Ulysses, Sicari's Joyce's Modernist Allegory, Joseph Campbell, and even the Annotated Ulysses for a too-real explanation of people and places. But by this disk set alone you know the novel.Continual rehearing drops pearls of comprehension and connection in the most unexpected ways and places.

Nothing more."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The introduction of this book is wonderful, it helped me understand, not only the book itself, but also Joyce's state of mind while writting it. The book itself is one of the most amazing literary achievments, but if you haven't read any Joyce before, I suggest you read A Portrait of The Artist As a Young Man first to get a feal for the style and Joyce's writting. This a very long book (933 pages-the introduction is around 50) but I can almost gaurentee you will find something you absolutley love in the book unless you didn't understand it at all. Well if you do finishing reading this and want more of the same style of book, try to read Gravity's rainbow, but take a pen and paper so you can take notes on the more then 400 characters so you'll remember them near the end of the book, and also try to pay attention to who is narrating because of the constant and occasionally abrupt changes from character to character. Well anyway I hope you find this reviews helpful.

In a way, it made an already difficult book to read even more difficult.This version of the book I purchased can be found here:UlyssesDoes this version I bought not seem a lot like this one here?Notice the similar covers? The text is exactly the same, only rearranged. That and the fact that this new publisher Unabridged Books is fairly new, which at the time of this writing is not even a MONTH old, leads me to believe that they are perhaps connected. Tell me, anyone who has purchased this version, it isn't printed out of Lexington, Kentucky, is it?You should not purchase this version, not if you actually want to try and understand this book. If you plan on using outside materials to further guide you, then this book should be ignored, because the lack of chapter annotations will make it rather difficult to follow along."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Launched for the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday, this meticulous 22-CD performance of the novel brings it fully to life in ways that are at times indescribably beautiful. Whatever is difficult in the novel becomes much more accessible as the spoken word. Both the male and female narrations are off the charts. As for the music, it is masterful and never intrusive or pretentious. Yes, even this oral rendition is enhanced by a gloss, whether the one included in the set or a separate rendition (the one I used was James Heffernan's lectures, also on CDs, from the Teaching Company).

That's right. All of them.First of all, the ones that accuse Ulysses of being a load of gibberish and a sluggish read. They're right. However, Ulysses is not meant to be a pure pleasure read. It's meant to be studied. I read a lot, and before Ulysses, the longest a book had ever taken me was two weeks. Ulysses took me two months. I did it as a part of my AP English project, and tackled it AFTER I had read Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and sections of Richard Ellmann's biography. Even then, I kept Ulysses and Annotated and the Cliffs Notes close by my side.There are many parts of Ulysses that don't make sense. But the parts that do are brilliant. Joyce was a true genius, and if you take the time to studdy his work, you will be blown alway by his mastery of the English language, and his understanding of human nature. I hope to become a writer someday, and reading Ulysses has totally changed my outlook in writing and life.I would be lying if I said I enjoyed Ulysses all the way through. But after you have read it, you will find that your mind is open to a million different poissiblities concerning life, other people, and the use of language.Who knows?

Amazon should remove this edition, it is a corrupt text falsely advertised as complete."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I want you to decide for yourself. Ulysses, to some the masterpiece of all 20th century works, a glorious, sun-ravaged inspiring that is open to all nooks and encompasses all passion. Others call it ludicrious, pompous and dull; overlong; a frustrating exercise in pieceing together symbols. I want you to look over some of the other reviews and see for yourself the division between the pros and the cons; the academic justifications and the confused, ennerverated whining. The fans overpraise with unspeakable delight: believing themselves in the know--a fan of another person's excellence, a seer of all there is to know. You can scan the pages and glean all sorts of terminology, from the label of 'modernism' to the execution of 'stream-of-consciousness' (two indescribible approaches that cannot be so singularly defined as to explain just what, exactly, is going on). There are references to other experts' reviews, and the almost outraged frustration with which it is bespoken tells the person who couldn't get into it that somebody else out there has written about all the things you didn't like in the book and therefore it must be brilliance. The haters are less uniform in their scorn, although most of them summarize 'it didn't make any sense' in one form or another. There are rat-tat-tats of 'boring(s)' and machine gun slogans writing off this unquestionably influencial opus as something not even worthy of remembering.Me? I fall less in the middle and more to the side of scorn. It is a techically dazzlingly display--a rip-roar of English-Latin-Gallic with the cantor on fire and the rhythm in flames. Boom-boom-boom goes the glory of this lover of language who plays and who plays and who plays--trickling insight with the tickle of a feather and bringing the house down with a terse yet finely tuned phrase . . .The biggest problem is the story--a legitimate babble of voices talking over one another with a transformative center that can't keep anyone focused on what any of the characters is actually saying (the characters notice this too). The dialogue goes on for pages--twenty--fifty page stretches!--where no one seems to have the interest or attention span enough to keep things settled for a moment to even decide if any of them know what they're talking about. The topics shift abruptly--aloofly, it would seem--and the range of all of their interests is predictably limited. I can respect (and even admire) the effort to invoke this mindless clamor of Babel, and appreciate the consistancy that can redeem by none of them ever learning anything, but the end result is a story that no one can follow unless they had written it themselves.Ulysses is a book Joyce wrote for himself. No doubt it was joy--an endless experimentation from a frustrated (and rather pompous) author who finally felt justified at the publication of his previous two books. Ulysses, to me, reads as more of a show-off work. A man with great genius who wanted to prove to everyone just how great he could be. The problem is that he was boasting to himself. Here is a book about me me me! All passing to 'naturalism' or the 'realistic aspect' related in numerous grinding scences, are valid, certainly, but merely another label that cannot begin to describe the monster Joyce created here.In the end, an endlessly unpleasurable read that causes one to stop and think often, some of that time about setting the book aside and reading something better--"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What to make of Ulysses, that towering work of modernism that has been seen as both the hallmark of the age, and an impediment to later generations of writers trying to get out from beneath Joyce's long shadow?Ultimately, the worth of the novel can't be questioned, even if you do not \`like' the book. Perhaps no novel in the 20th century exerted (and continues to exert) so great an influence over the written arts. Lots of ink has been spilled about the novel. On this, my third reading of it after twenty years, I have this to say:Part of the challenge and thrill of the novel is Joyce's chameleon like ability to thrown on literary guises, while at the same time being intractably, even stubbornly, Joyce. He had few illusions about his genius, and wrote a work from that lofty standpoint. Although loaded with humor, dirty jokes, and common place incidents, Ulysses is an intellectual's novel, meant not to be read but re-read. It is nearly Talmudic in its dimensions. Dig deeper into a passage and you find multiple layers of meaning.Part of the challenge (and frustration for some) of this novel is its incredible restlessness. The first third of the novel features Joyce's famous stream of consciousness technique. Characters are minds in bodies, thinking a stream of thought, occasionally interrupted by some external datum.Here Joyce creates a kind of hyper-naturalism. It is as if he wishes to show readers that the naturalism of the preceding generations was nothing more than a fictive mask. Here is the closest we can get to the workings of the human mind in its social and psychological settings. He bends language get this. He coins new words. He leaves words dangling off and thoughts unfinished. In other words, he tries to reproduce how our halting minds actually think their thoughts.Once Joyce has accomplished this, he appears to repudiate it. We then get a variety of chapters written from certain literary standpoints (often mockingly so). It is as if Joyce is saying: this is literature too, a series of guises that we throw on and off at will. This is the lens through which people see the world. They are more than encapsulated minds. They also structure their worlds.So, Ulysses keeps the reader off kilter, and with a sense of sheer delight on the part of Joyce. We start over and over again, chewing on the same material and spiritual conditions of one day in Dublin over a hundred years ago.In the process much that is profound happens surrounded by a spectacle of mundane happenings. In other words, just another day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Is this the greatest novel of all time, or just a colossal waste of time? My experience is that reading Joyce's ULYSSES will indeed pay the reader great dividends for the time she put into it. However, I don't believe it's a novel that can be understood and appreciated without a great investment of repeated readings and consultation of outside texts. In fact, I don't think there's ever been a novel that requires that the reader consult at least a half dozen texts and repeated readings to not be totally bewildered by what the hell the author is trying to say.Here's why I say this. I read ULYSSES several times while in college. The first reading gave me absolutely nothing! However, because I was an English major, was deeply interested in Irish lit, and had the time, I gave the novel repeated readings and consulted dozens of secondary books and periodicals. Then I began to get somewhere. What before was a jumble of gibberish about Irish towers and bars and streets and a dog on a beach, before born baby boardman had bliss, shamefaced peaches clop clop clop introblio ad nauseam began to reveal the deeper currents underneath. And I feel it was all quite worth my time and trouble.So here's my advice for the new reader. The 1st reading should be accompanied by Cliff Notes (don't laugh) to get a basic idea of each chapter's theme. This will be a great help. Beyond that, the ANNOTATIONS book is a very good resource. Another secondary source on ULYSSES that I found very valuable and interesting was the many great pieces from THE JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY on the novel. I hope that by now someone has digitally compiled all that scholarship so that it's not lost and forgotten in college library basements!Here's what I found out: Joyce's astounding accomplishment with ULYSSES is that he successfully layered multiple literary, religious, psychological, philosophical biological and historical structures in a single work. The 1st chapter alone is worthy of a full semester's attention in order to unravel and reveal the myriad references and their cross-associations. What we have here is modern scripture, and the largest literary puzzle ever. If intricate literary structure interests you, this is the magnum opus. I'm not risking overstatement to declare that ULYSSES could be called The Book of Life, as a key reason why so many scholars have lauded it as the greatest of novels is that it's the most voluminous and eloquent tale of living that's ever been written.But again, to share these scholars' opinion of this novel WILL require MORE work from the reader than she has given to probably anything else she's tried to read and really appreciate. Know this before you begin reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Simon & Brown Edition is a poorly laid out version of the novel.

YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings.

When Judge Woolsey decided in the 1930s to institute what Morris Ernst decreed \\"the New Deal in the law of letters,\\" making Ulysses legal to own and distribute in the U.S. (before that it was contraband, smuggled into the country as if it was bootleg scotch by, among other people, Ernest Hemingway), Random House, which had locked up the U.S. rights, decided to act fast, while the book was hot (Joyce even made the cover of Time magazine). So they rushed their now-legal version into print as quickly as possible, using in the process the ugliest, most unreadable typeface known to man.In 1961, they revised the text, getting rid of some obvious errors (if I'm not mistaken they were in such a rush originally that they used Samuel Roth's 1927 pirated edition as copytext!), but for some reason they kept the same repellent font, probably because resetting the whole book in a new font would have been too expensive.When I finally read Ulysses complete, it was in the 1960 Bodley Head edition, which is miles ahead of its American counterpart in elegance and readability. Unfortunately, the text is not nearly as good (Joyce scholar Hugh Kenner's comment on it is particularly apt -- suffice it to say that it's the title of Jacobean playwright John Ford's most famous work).So if you're planning on taking a stab at Ulysses, this is what I would suggest. Forget about the Vintage Paperback edition (as well as Hans Walter Gabler's so-called \\"Corrected Text,\\" for textual reasons too cumbersome to get into here), and go with the Everyman's Library hardcover. It may not be ideal (contrary to what I thought at first, they reprint the Bodley Head edition and not the Modern Library 1961 text), but it's published in a large and reader-friendly font. It's the edition to get if you've never tried Ulysses before (although Dover has recently put out a reproduction of Shakespeare and Co.'s 1922 First Edition that's worth looking into).And if you haven't read Ulysses before, I would suggest that before you do, you: a) read Joyce's earlier and simpler novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, b) try a biography first (Richard Ellmann's is the authoritative one, especially in its 1982 revision, but I'm rather partial to Stan Gebler Davies' shorter biography from the 1970s, which sounds like it was written by a character in Ulysses). Also: c) find and read a good commentary first, such as Edmund Wilson's chapter on Joyce in Axel's Castle, or Hugh Kenner's book, entitled Ulysses or Harry Blamire's The Bloomsday Book. If you're a Joycean newbie, you will need help. Plenty of it.Even then it won't be easy. But Joyce, with the possible exception of Proust, wrote the greatest novel of the last century, and if you're any kind of a serious reader you really owe it to yourself to take a whack at it. Clifton Fadiman once compared reading Ulysses to climbing Mount Everest. Not many people make it to the summit, but the ones who get to the top are afforded a view that's hard to beat. Reading Joyce is less a matter of reading a book than of having a life experience, and a precious one (although some might wonder in which sense of the word) at that. Good luck."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Very pleased with the condition and price of the book.

This audio book is not easily listened to even in a quiet car."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This whoel review began as a comment, and tehn I realizedi had soemthign to say for myself on the topic, so here it is:I took a Course on Joyce at NUI Galway and I am thankful that I did because otherwise I would not appreciate Ulysses. Many of the points made by detractors of Joyce and Ulysses are valid, in fact most of them are. Even Yeats who praised the book confessed that he never finished it. But that is indicative of some peculiar choices by Joyce, for instance, the Third Chapter is intentionally unreadable. Joyce apparently did this to make a point about the mentality of the educated Irishmen, such as himself, who had the tendency to make themselves irrelevant to their countrymen. He did this by filling the entirety of the chapter with verbiage so obtuse and obscure that even educated people would have trouble telling you what's actually happen, which isn't much, they guy just sits there on the beach and feels sorry for himself. If I had not been in a Module whereby the Lecturer explained that this is essentially unreadable I surely would have put down the book forever.There are many points of interest for me in the book, I highly suggest reading the last chapter by itself as its prose is quite enjoyable and really provides of portrait of a time and a place and a people. It's not really necessary to read the book stait through, as my good friend and classmate (though he never took this course) explained it to me: \\"Ulysses is a book which is never intended to be finished, you just pick it up and open it up anywhere and start reading and when you can't take it anymore, you put it back down.\\"In regards to this book, if it can help provide the insight I needed to help me understand Ulysses I would say it is worthwhile, but my experience is that these books never do that, they just tell you what they think it is you should know about the famous book, banking on the name-recognition of the book and the author, knowing full well that most people has never read enough of the book to refute them.It was a strange thing for Joyce to do in his effort to \\"write the greatest book in the English language\\" where the result was really much more (and then again sometimes less) then a book at all. The volumous \\"story\\" - we'll call it that for lack of a better word, really became an entity within itself because he hi-jacked the English language to make statements by the use of the text itself rather than within it, and within the hundreds of pages he hid what was considered pornographic imagery, knowing full well that those who would take exception to it would be hard pressed to actually read it for themselves. The result was so un-approachable that he actually had to tell people that it was a parallel to the Odyssey (despite the name) and provide notes on how to interpret it. If this was any other book this would signal the utter worthlessness of the book, but what Joyce did, and which has never been recreated, is the exception, if you are ready to accept it for what it is, and what it isn't: a good story.The story itself, is rather boring and uninteresting, this was part of Joyce's design though. He was making a statement about Ireland by making this incredibly uneventful and uninteresting story and then contrasting it with the heroic tales of Odysseus. There-by making the Joyce-equivalent all the worse by comparison. Like I said, it makes the story itself boring, but it's interesting if you know that going in, thank goodness Joyce provided the author of the first literary analysis of Ulysses with his notes!Even though I whole-heartily agree with many of these points on their own, I believe that Ulysses is an import book to peruse, if not read. And it should not be dismissed in its entirety. However for an enjoyable work by Joyce I highly suggest something else, such as Dubliners, where the short story form restricts Joyce from getting to ostentatious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit it took me atleast two times the amount of time to read this as most books but,it was worth the time.

But, how to acomplish yhis ambition, when Romeo and Juliet and Anna Karenina is allready written? Joyce's solution is to redefine what the concept of a Great Love novel is all about. Instead of regarding the reader as someone to ammuse and seduce - someone that has the passive role of observing the story, Joyce combats the reader and makes the readers experience of reading the book as a crusial part of his story.Even the 16th of May 1904 was a long time ago and happend far away as Joyce wrote Ulysses in Trieste, Zurich and Paris from 1914 to 1921, Joyce describes virtually every detail that happened in Dublin that special day, long ago, far away. Even the fact that James Joyce wasn't much of a husband, drinking heavily when he had money, often was out of work and in conflict with his family because of his drinking, spending and unemployment, working on Ulysses - against his doctors strict orders as it would make him blind - when he was in a state of working, his wife hanged on to him all this time. In the same way the book appears difficult to read, and goes on \\"forever\\" in the sense of pages, places and number and level of hidden meanings you can dedicate alife to, Ulysses simply gets too much for many of its readers, making them give in, regarding it to complicated, difficult to understand, simply not worth the effort. In the same manner, the most obvious conclusion to draw from a marriage with James Joyce, might be that it was not worth the effort. As soon as I understood that this probably was exactly the point Joice was trying to make though, it was like I would not and could not let him prove that he was right and unlike my previous attemts to finnish the novel, I succeded. Blessing or curse - I guess this feeling of denying to give in, is excactly what can make a relatationship like this go on.As far as I know, Joyce is the first writer to introduce this projective way of writing - integrate the readers feelings and reactions to what he reads as a vital part of the story. After though, this projective writing is used by several writers - for instance when Bret Easton Ellis writes in a manner that makes the reader of American Psycho feel as bored as his main character Patrick Bateman feels - illustrating that he has more in common with you and me than we care about, or when Jerome David Sallinger in A Perfect day for Bananafish at the last line of the shortstory makes you realize that he has wrapped you arond his little finger all the time, manipulated you to think what he wants you to think, feel what he wants you to feel, leaving you with the predjustises that he wanted you to have , in order not to make you see the fatal conclution.It is obviously other ways to read Ulysses. You find a lot of them in the other customers review. It can be a good advice to put a copy of the so called Ulysses schema in the book when you try to read it, to make it easier to orient in time, space and theme. Make an internet search and you will find it.I hope you will finnish Ulysses with a sense of having read something that made it worth-while:)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If I never read any of his other books, this one alone would make Joyce my favorite author. It isn't a book for everyone, but if you're patient with it, it's a very rewarding read. This book is one of a handful that gets consistently better with each reading. The first go is the hardest, but I encourage you to finish it. Joyce said that he wanted to paint a portrait of Dublin so complete that if it were to disappear, it could be recreated from what was described in his book. I don't know how true that statement is, but I have never read a more complete description of human nature as that presented in this book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great edition for your first time through Ulysses.

Most people who tell you that they understand the book are lying. Joyce was a genius--not in a way that he was a &quot;really good&quot; writer, but in a way that he simply had more brain power than almost all of us. He pushed himself for years and years to write this book, and he is a genius, so why should we be able to understand this book in one or two readings? You might get the gist of it after a few readings, a good professor to guide you through, and a strong literary background. But it doesn't matter if you have your MA in English or not, Joyce's intricacies will, for most of us, remain elusive. Not understanding Ulysses doesn't mean you're stupid it means you are human. I don't know why people are suprised that they don't &quot;get it&quot; when they read it. Most of us will probably never be able to grasp the brilliance of Mozart's music or Einstein's theories either, we have to kind of trust people that know how good they are. After a while we may be able to see why they are so good too. It's curious that people would hold literature to a lower bar than those disciplines. If you're not a rocket scientist, chances are you're probably not going to pick up a book on rocket science and expect to understand it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Certainly, Ulysses must be one of the hardest books to review. The fact that so many has been written about it makes one shy to add one's own humble opinion, while the fact that it has recently (although somewhat controversially) been chosen as the best book of the last century makes one want to give it the benefit of the doubt with respect to every critical remark.And most of all, Ulysses is simply a brilliant book. The reader finds herself immersed in a dull day, which nevertheless reflects all aspects of life in Dublin around 1900. And this realist, evocative aspect of the book is balanced by its success in mirroring large parts of the literary heritage with which every book must come to terms. Loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, and riddled with references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, it shows both a tremendous respect for man's wish to put his life into words and an ironic distance from every specific attempt to do so. There were indeed many times I found myself thinking that I was reading the perfect book, the &quot;novel to end all novels&quot;.Nonetheless, in the end I concluded - albeit hesitantly - that Ulysses is a flawed gem. There are two aspects of the book that make it so. First, there are the constant allusions to Irish folk music. Indeed, large parts of Ulysses (and not only the Sirens chapter) read as though they should be sung. While this certainly adds a layer of meaning to the book for everyone who knows these tunes, it makes for frustration with everyone who does not. Moreover, with the inclusion of this fickle and all too transitory form of art, Joyce has strongly connected his novel to the early 1900's. While this might have been his intention, it detracts from the novel's universality and its ability to transcend the boundaries of its time. Even now, 75 years after its publication, I often felt like I was gazing at a world which is both completely lost and partly incomprehensible. The second major flaw is the apparent lack of structure between the episodes. While every episode itself is highly structured, and one of the main joys in reading the book is to gradually discover these structures, I could not help but wonder why certain structures were chosen, and how they relate to each other. The prime example of this is the Ithaca episode, in which Joyce has turned some rather mundane events into an elaborate catechism of questions and answers. While hilarious at times, this structure seemed highly arbitrary to me. I am quite sure that many interpretations of this aspect of Ulysses have been given in the secondary literature, but the essence of structure - as in poems - seems to me that it should invite the reader to understand it: the reader should see glimpses of a larger whole in order to start looking for it. Unfortunately, in Ulysses I did not find myself invited, but more often the subject of some incomprehensible joke of the author.I am well aware that both flaws are only so on the basis of some (probably outmoded) theory of literature, and that they can both be turned into major beauties of the book. Nonetheless, I think that Ulysses is the prime example of a book who wishes to be perfect, but which, unfortunately, is not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Like everyone who've read the book, i saw ulysses very complicated and hard to read. It's a huge book; about 1000 pages and the hardnesses in them makes readers have difficulties while reading. The confusing writing style, too many characters and names of places, conflict between thoughts and speeches, many words/sentences in many different languages, a great cultural background with many colors, unordinary writing skill.. All these and other causes make the book ununderstandable and complex. But, beyond this, you can feel the genius writer among the pages.

I think part of the reason that many readers have difficulty with the novel, though, is that they approach it similarly to other reads. Personally, I think this is a mistake.Ulysses is, in my opinion, the literary equivalent of improvisational jazz. Improvisational jazz is considered by many musical professionals as the purest of music. Jazz performers find it thrilling, joyful, and simply without comparison to other musical forms. Yet, many others consider it boring and difficult to understand. I think at least part of the reason for this is that it lacks the musical structure to which we are all programmed to respond to. Many people have no frame of reference to place it in.In a literary sense, I think Ulysses shares these aspects in many ways. Many passages are difficult to understand, especially if one seeks a familiar literary structure within which to place it. And yet, if one steps out of the box a little and takes the time to appreciate its poetic lyricism, to allow the words to flow without necessarily seeking to place them within that familiar structure, some otherwise difficult passages can be reached at level different from other novels. The normal reader's desire to understand the passage in its purely contextual form is lessened. The end result is that the novel becomes a less daunting read.Ultimately, though, I give it only four stars. Irrespective of a reader's approach, too many brain cells have to fire for too long to get through it (its over 1000 pages long). I don't think most people want to work that hard to read a book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is complex, evocative, and displays an incredible mastery of language.

Sure James Joyce was a writer of some talent as shown by his early short stories and his Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. But this book?When he wrote it Joyce was in the hands of the European artistic progressives. They had rejected the notion of contest in favor of form. That is hypnotized by that arch braggart Wagner they accepted the delusion that art must continually progress and change form. When he wrote art generally was subject to continual change in style. Picassos went through his various periods, French Art struggled through Impressionism, Cubism and so on.James Joyce moving in those circles felt that he had to reject the form and grammar of his predecessors. That is he had to reject the way of writing which made Dickens, Eliot, Austin and Conrad the giants of literature that they were. What in fact is wrong with the use of grammar and the English Language. It has given us masterpieces such as Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth.With Ulysses you can see a novel peeking out from behind the obscure language.

In art there was C&eacute;zanne, Seurat, and Picasso. In music Scriabin was experimenting with the melding of music and light.Artists were experimenting with form rather than looking at content. Sometimes these experiments worked other times they led to a dead end and were forgotten.Ulysses is an experimental novel, one that uses the form of stream of consciousness. The form is at the expense of its readability and clarity. What happened with Joyce's experiment, it limped through Finegan's Wake which is so impenetrable it barely rates as a puzzle and died. Ulysses as an experimental art form is a dead end, and with good reason.The sorts of things that made and make literature great are the sorts of things that Joyce rejects with his experiments in form. Literature is related to the content rather than the empty vessel of form.This of course is not to say that Joyce was without talent.

In fact, much like the splatter-painting of Jackson Pollock, or the black-on-black canvases of Ad Reinhardt, or the silent compositions of John Cage, or the cut-ups of Wm. Burroughs or the pop lyrics of Bob Dylan, Ulysses has no real meaning at all--and that is its secret to success. When an artist has something important to say, he (or she) expresses himself with as much clarity as possible, just as a person who is shouting &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; would. When he has little or nothing to say, he writes or paints or plays either right-brain stream-of-consciousness gobbledygook and calls it &quot;metaphor&quot; or &quot;exploring the unconscious&quot;, or presents minimalist nothing at all and calls it &quot;conceptual&quot;. He can then sit back for decades and watch the pseudointellectuals and tenured humanities professors invent endless meanings where there are none, whereas books that contain any clarity will slip into obscurity, since their meanings are obvious and leave the masters (and doctors) of hot air nothing to debate. Ulyssess is the all-time champion of this sort of thing; while many of modern art's similar hoaxes have long since been relegated to the proverbial dustbin, Joyce's obvious genius for manipulating words keeps this thing at the top of the charts among those influenced by academic pretense. The fact that those words are all surface and communciate not one idea of any significance to anyone is a something of a shame for serious people (who might waste time seeking them here, due to its reputation), but an absolute goldmine for the people who like to write glorified term papers about this glorified crossword puzzle and its like. At least the more general reading public has never been swayed by such frauds, preferring mere entertainments like Lord of the Rings--which indeed have more going for them, on any level, than anything Joyce and his kind have ever done."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This rating reflects the quality of the edition, not the work itself.

It's the most obscure and dense book I've ever read, made even more so by its modernist experiments, but I have to admit it's phenomenally well done. The problem is, instead of turning each page to find out what the characters would do next, I kept reading to find out what *Joyce* was going to do next. So I found it wonderful as a written work, with all the fun, strange and brilliant techniques Joyce used; but as a novel, as a story about people's lives, I really didn't have much interest. I was kept at a distance from the characters by Joyce's telling of the story, so that even when the characters were deep in frenzied monologues, I only heard Joyce's writing, and not the characters' actual voices. I suppose this is typical of modernism, but I found it made the entire experience somewhat unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is often much talk about how to best &quot;get&quot; this book. Many will suggest various commentaries, some will suggest several &quot;deep&quot; reads.The best way to come to understand this book, its place in the history of literature, and the excessive praise it has earned in its reviews is to read one simple fable: &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen.If you are looking for an example of great literature, don't look here. If you are looking for a model to improve the precision of your own thought and expression, don't look here. If you want to come to understand a great joke and laugh yourself into hysterics at the sheer buffoonery of modern life, read this book.Having made it through this sick joke of a book and coming to know it thoroughly, I've been in a position to enjoy fits of uncontrolled laughter when I listen to fans of this book begin to yammer. It's a great inside joke that you can really only be in on if you've read the book and understand something of its place in literary history. Having read this silly tripe and listening to self-important types discuss it is more flat out silly than getting stoned out of your brain and watching the South Park movie.As H. C. Andersen taught us, if we simply cannot find any meaning in something it is entirely possible there is no meaning there. And just because other people claim to see meaning in this book, or fleas in a flea circus, or clothes on a naked emperor... well, you get the idea.Hence, I have to give this book at least 2 stars.

One thinks of Homer."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book for writers. It's not terribly important what you, O great reader, think about it. You oh great important critic, who think too much about this book are just a tiresome nobody. It's just a fun and difficult book to read. It's just a fricken' book. James Joyce just wrote a book for you to enjoy. If you want to make a big hairy deal out of some Irish guy writing a book, you probably have no life, or else a Master's thesis to write. James Joyce just stuffed a bunch of language into a book he thought he might like writing. He was just trying to write something worth reading, like Mark Twain, or William Faulkner would. Get over yourself. Joyce took language a little farther out on a limb. He was just another writer trying to make love to English. Why would any writer not try to love a language as lovely as English? Joyce made love to English. Shakespeare was a true polymorphous lover of English. He was embarassing. If this book is pornographic it is only because Joyce was having sex with a great language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't blame reviewer Jim Lyke for not liking the copy of Ulysses he picked up at the St. Louis Airport. It is, however, far superior to the clams there."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce defeats his purpose by making this book impossible for a reasonably well-educated reader possessed of a reasonably decent vocabulary to get through without having to reach for the dictionary every other sentence, causing the reader to break his rhythm and disrupting the author's stream-of-consciousness narrative. And Joyce's vocabulary isn't merely extensive, its obscure and often so archaic that most dictionaries weighing fewer than 20 lbs. don't contain the words he uses. Unless you're young, if you don't read a book sentence by sentence, understanding the meaning of most every word, you aren't really reading or absorbing it, and its a waste of time, which is sad, because Ulysses has been such an influential work. But ultimately who cares? I'm coming to the unfortunate conclusion that the work of almost every member of the Lost Generation is failing to stand the test of time. Its one thing to read these icons in your early 20s; its another when you're approaching 50. As you get older, you realize Fitzgerald's and Hemingway's novels are terribly dated; Gertrude Stein's theories about writing are infinitely more interesting than her writing itself; and guys like Dos Passos are irrelevant. Now Joyce. Like Pound, he's interesting in the abstract, I guess. And I imagine that, years from now, apart from Portrait of the Artist and Dubliners, such will be his only legacy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is not that difficult a book to understand, contrary to what you may have been led to believe. Compared with Finnegans Wake, for instance, it's a cake walk. The book's most frustrating part comes early on, after Stephen leaves his Uncle Richie's house. From here on out, a dictionary (preferably a comprehensive one) becomes invaluable. In my opinion, a good deal of the confusion surrounding Ulysses has arisen out of the fact that most people, upon encountering a word that they do not understand, choose to merely carry on in confusion, as opposed to looking the word up. You would be shocked at how instantly comprehensible this book becomes once a dictionary is employed. Since this book was written as a sort of mock-heroic counterpoint to the Homeric poems, a knowledge of those literary works is also very useful for any competent appreciation of Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All I can say after finally finishing Ulysses is that it deserves its reputation - both of them. Yes, it is a masterpiece - and, yes, it is a difficult, at times seemingly impenetratable read. When I finished reading this book and finally closed it, I felt I had accomplished a monumental deed. This is the only book I've ever read - and I've read many (difficult ones, too) - that was an actual physical chore to read. One reviewer mentioned that reading it is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest - many people start it, but few make it to the summit - and, ridicilous as that sounds, it is true, in a way. I'm not going to go into a detailed analysis of this book (that's arguably impossible, anyway), or summarize the plot, or anything like that - there is no plot. Small review forums limited to 1,000 words such as this one is not the place for a detailed dissertation on a book as profound, monumental, and important as Ulysses - doctoral thesises and 100,000 word essays have been written for that purpose by people far more qualified than I. It is not difficult, but impossible to summarize Ulysses: it must read in full. I have done so - it wasn't easy, but I did it. I read Joyce's A Portrait of The Artist As A Young Man first (which I highly reccommend you do also), although I didn't use any annotation or Cliff's Notes, or anything like that. I have no doubt that many of the book's complexities, metaphors, allusions, and ancedotes were lost on me, but I wanted to read the book on my own first. I don't claim total comprehension of his vast and difficult masterpiece; I fully admit that there are many parts of the book that I did not understand. This is no reason to slander the book, as many have ignorantly done. I did enjoy reading the book, however - and felt great joy and a sense of accomplishment upon on reading it - and yes, it IS a masterpiece, and for this reason: this is one of the few, if not the only book(s) ever written that accurately and realistically depicts real life. There is no plot, there is no \\"story\\" - there is certainly no moral. What this book (I believe) attempts to do - and does - is to portray life in a fictional setting - real life. This book takes two normal people, and describes their day. The cross paths at times - intersect, ramble, and collide - and this book, basically, just shows a normal day in the life of two normal people. This may not sound exciting - it isn't. It may sound boring - it often is. Imagine if you wrote down in a book every single event of your day in pain-staking detail (and there are parts in thsi book where Joyce goes into such detail as to border on mundanity, despite its ultra realism.) Still, it is a brilliant and ingenious literary device - surprisignly unattemped before - and carried off marvelously well here. This book addresses the normal, everyday things that other books always cease to mention: defecation, masturbation, rambling thoughts inside a person's head. Like Portrait, this book contains no quotation marks. All dialogue is written as it is personally experienced by the character; I know no other writer besides Joyce who writes - both dialogue and narraration - from INSIDE the character: you actually feel what it's like to walk around inside a person's head, rather than just witnessing his external actions, like every other book in the world. Ulysses, though a long and difficult read (especially if one chooses to study it), is ultimately rewarding, and I reccommend tackling it to anyone who reads with an open mind. It is a masterpiece, and it is, indeed, the true last word on realism."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A blasphemous, vulgar and sexual book about the lives of sots in Ireland written by a Shakespeare-variety wordsmith. At first glance, it sounds too good to be true. The catch...An extremely comprehensive plot summary for each chapter will only take about 25 words. That's right-it takes place over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words. However, there are only two ways to get this summary: 1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading a Cliffs Notes-type book.This book has been fairly assessed as incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing. The average reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.Still, I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and embrace it. Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately. After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life. I could not read for five more days. I hated the next four hundred pages of the book. Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work. It took the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.I'm one of those people who reads the dictionary for fun. Because of this, I know a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read. Ulysses changed that. I think that he used every word that I have ever learned by reading the dictionary, but have not heard in life. Finding those words in print is worth reading the 700+ pages.As a smattering of the jewels of perspicacity of James Joyce, I have included my four favorite parts of the book. If you like this small morsel of the volume, you will love the rest. Enjoy!1. Moses, Moses, king of the jews, wiped his arse in the Daily News.2. Love loves to love love.3. Q. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner...? A. Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.4. Q. What in water did Bloom ... admire? A. Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level ...

In my experience as a teacher of undergraduates and as a published writer of fiction as well, I would like to say in response to comments by a so-called Phd English student, that criticising a monumental work of art that deals with the need for a personalised fiction in the fragmentation of twentieth century alienation, reflects an ignorance that boggles the mind. It is better to remain silent on what one doesn't understand than convince the world of one's lack of, well, insight. My suggestion to those who want to fathom what Joyce is trying to do is to check out what writers like Burgess have to say. And as for comments about male 'post-modernist' stuff, please read Grass's 'The Flounder' on what excess feminism is all about and learn to grow."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are no notes in this book.

I really appreciated it! Merry Christmas."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A masterpiece? Yes, no doubt about it, yes, it is a masterpiece, yes!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" is endowed with Aristotelian unity of space: it all happens in Dublin, and God knows, it helps if you know your way around that city. Unity of time as well, it all happens in a 24-hour period starting on the morning of Thursday, June 16, 1904, and God knows it helps if you know the headlines of Dublin newspapers for that day. It even has unity of action, whatever there is of that ingredient in this novel. It all revolves around the current adulterous affair of Molly Bloom with the vulgar Blazes Boylan, and the preparation of her next adultery with intensely intellectual Stephen Dedalus, whose father Simon had also been her lover at some point. There seem to be three main characters: Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and the young \\"bard\\" Stephen Dedalus, alias Joyce himself. It is amusing that Joyce repeatedly keeps referring to Stephen Dedalus, his alter ego, as a bard, a title reserved these days for William Shakespeare. This seems to signal Joyce's conviction that he belongs to a very exclusive club with the bard of Stratford upon Avon as its only other member.Beyond these three \\"main\\" characters, there are literally hundreds of other characters whose names and even their Dublin addresses are mentioned and oft-repeated. You might think, I wrecked your whole pleasure in reading this book, by giving away these spoilers. You need not worry, as things are not what they seem to be. The true main character of the novel is none of the above, but rather the English language, of which Joyce has a command second to none, with the possible exception of the bard of Stratford upon Avon. I wouldn't be surprised if Joyce's vocabulary had weighed in at twice or maybe even thrice that of the typical educated reader, and not for a minute does he let you forget this fact. Why?Why? Well, the book has a clear anti-British slant, and Joyce is rubbing it in to the Brits, that it takes an Irish genius like himself, to show them what can be done with their language. He also feels free to distort the King's English, and by extremely clever alliterations, homophonies, misspellings and lists he manages to poke quite cruel fun at the tool he wields with such virtuosity. He casts Irish art in the role of \\"cracked lookingglass of a servant.\\"I just mentioned lists, and God knows, there are so many in this book, some of full-page length. The whole novel reads like a veritable prose-poem. Think but of the Joycean line \\"A veil awave upon the waves.\\" In many places Joyce lapses into actual poems, most marvelously that \\"Ballad of the Joking Jesus\\" (supposedly borrowed in an abridged and altered form from his estranged friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for the Buck Mulligan character in \\"Ulysses.\\") the first two lines of which I cannot resist writing down here,I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heardMy mother's a Jew, my father's a bird.In the next two lines he refers negatively to \\"Joseph the Joiner\\" and one cannot miss the sharing of James Joyce's own initials with both those of the Divine Joking Jesus and of His holy mother's sainted husband.Along Leopold Bloom's Dublin wanderings deep issues are addressed: the dynamics of anti-Semitism, the difference between male and female sexuality, the patterns of married life, among others. In the latter context, a whole chapter is devoted to an extremely original, if far from provably correct analysis of William Shakespeare's marriage to Ann Hathaway. What is remarkable is that this analysis manages to shed light also on the problems in the Bloom marriage, with Leopold Bloom taking a different and much more forgiving attitude toward his wife's adultery than the bard.When dealing with sexuality, Joyce, in a serious novel written a mere decade after the Victorian age, does not shy away from the use of four-letter words, the detailed description of masturbation and of passionate intercourse, and quite some space is devoted to bodily functions. Indeed a crucial scene in the penultimate (\\"Ithaca\\") chapter ends with Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus sealing their friendship by the quite homoerotic act of urinating together in the garden.Finally, maybe the most important influence this novel has had on modern literature is at the stylistic level. There can be little doubt that Vladimir Nabokov's exotic, if always so marvelously correct, word-choices owe a big debt to Joyce. The title character of one of Saul Bellow's famous novels shares the name of the minor character Moses Herzog in \\"Ulysses.\\" In \\"Ulysses\\" each chapter is written in a different style, here a romantic novel, there a tabloid newspaper, there a serious newspaper, now a play, then an unpunctuated stream of consciousness and so on. In \\"Herzog,\\" Bellow also mixes a basic narrative with the epistolary style of the letters despondent Herzog dispatches to all kinds of live and dead world leaders. The word \\"snot-green\\" invented by Buck Mulligan to describe the color of the Irish sea in the first chapter of \\"Ulysses\\" has made a comeback in twenty-first century novels, not to speak even of the use of four-letter words and explicit sexual scenes in serious modern fiction. To a certain extent, even the deeply moving poetic style of Tennessee Williams' marvelous plays seems indebted to a certain extent to Joyce.Above all, the stream of consciousness narration, which traces the free flow of the characters' thoughts rather than of their actions, has become a standard in modern fiction. Between the unexpected turns of these thoughts and the beauty of Joyce's use of the English language, one remains glued to \\"Ulysses\\" through its almost eight hundred pages, much as one would if he had spiced the story with all the trappings of a first rate thriller.As a practical piece of advice, use as I did a paperback edition, and tear it into some ten fascicles of seventy-eighty pages each. This way you can enjoy one of the major masterpieces of twentieth century literature without risking a hernia and/or a carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The ultimate controversial book, maybe just behind the bible.

So it's just fair to rate it a well-deserved 3 stars, the just average to a work that can easily be described as sublime and profane, at the same time -- sometimes not even chapter to chapter but paragraph to paragraph.

Naturally."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The basis of Joyce's work is the invigoration of Irish popular speech,the influence of music and song,English not being his native language,explains its unparalled virtuousity,also Joyce's near-blindness,his imagination becomes more auditory than visual as in Homer and Milton.Joyce must be read aloud for full appreciation.His poems are like songs.Also the great use of interior monologue for all 3 main characters.For Joyce the lapsed Catholic,words held magic sway over things: transubtantiaition. Disintegration of experience,integration of form.The theme and structure borrowed from Homer's Odyssey are a metaphor for Joyce's dream of Ireland's journey from a 'priest-ridden' backwater to a country taking its rightful place in the European intellectual and philosophical tradition.Joyce is the most cosmopolitan modern writer. Joyce's poetry is minor if charming,his drama doesn't work,his poetry works best in the comic framework of the prose novel.Style ceases to be a relationship between author and reader,instead becoming a relationship of a magical kind between author and object.Experience is replaced by prose.Joyce was a Flaubertian realist infected by the bacillus of modernism, following The Dubliners,he wrote Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, calling his hero Stephen Dedalus,connecting the contemporary character with the mythical artificer:there are two movements,one outward from Ireland the other downward into myth. Superficially Stephen is dissociating himself,on a deeper level achieving an association with myth.This led onto the systematization of Ulysses,with the mystification that followed in its wake.Too systematized Joyce asked?All Joyce's works have a strong autobiographical element.Ulysses was preceded by the play Exiles.An Irish writer,Richard Rowan believes his wife is playing him false with a former friend/disciple.Rowan finds himself in a tragic position regarding his mother,a pious Catholic.The theme is autobiographical.A onetime friend in 1909 claimed that when Joyce was courting Nora,she had shared her favours with himself.Rowan reveals that he himself longs for his own deception,deliberately making himself a party to it.Rowan identifies with Christ and looks for Judases amongst his friends.Very Joycean.Nora thought he encouraged her to go with other men.This play is the real basis for Ulysses,with the part of Richard Rowan divided between Stephen Dedalus,haunted by his dead mother,and Bloom,haunted by the idea of his wife's infidelity.They are the same person and may be regarded as a man young and old or two aspects of the same man.The subject of the book is the attempt to reconcile them.They pass,they skirt one another all day,but it is only at night that they meet.Each chapter is written in a different style,the names given to these styles is metaphorical,each metaphor sustained by puns.For Joyce all thought arises from the unconscious and returns to it.We need to read Ulysses by a process of free association.The opening chapters of Ulysses are the highest development of Joyce's peculiar genius, for this lay with the habitual,the normal,the everyday,and his interest and observation were sustained by an elaborate system of analogy.But analogy will not permit of growth and development,these have to be foisted artificially onto the book,and as it approaches a crisis,it becomes bogged in tortuous technical devices,like the chapter of the lying -in hospital where the development of the embryo is illustrated by the development of English prose.The problem is it reduces man to dissociated metaphor.Humanity explodes like an atom bomb."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since this book contains no chapters, it's very hard to index; Buki editions did a great job putting it together and making navigation a breeze."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From start to finish, Mr. Joyce dazzles the reader with the use of symbolism, dark humor, semantic puzzles, riddles, irony, grace, and magic.

Even though I've read the novel many times, I'm not qualified to compare this new edition to its predecessors: I'm a commercial artist, not a literary scholar. I AM qualified, however, to complain about how badly produced this book is. Professor Rose refers in his intro to the important influence that editors, designers and printers have on a text. Careful analysis of those influences are the basis of the method he used to create this new edition. Well, too bad he wasn't able to influence the publisher. This edition of Ulysses is printed on very cheap paper -- the kind of dim gray brittle stuff that the cheapest of romance fiction is printed on. Fine for a book that will be read once, but terrible for a &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; of a classic that will be reread and annotated. These pages will be badly discolored in a few years. The typography is mediocre, too: the title page looks like the Bad Example in any design textbook. The newspaper-style headlines in the &quot;Aeolus&quot; chapter are barely readable -- of course the ink spread on that awful paper doesn't help.

Gabler's \\"corrected text\\" is an appalling defacement of a classic book; it should not be used. For an excellent account of Gabler's edition--of the legal reasons for its extensive modifications of the text, of the dubious textual methods employed, of the subsequent scholarly controversy--read Bruce Arnold's excellent little book _The Scandal of Ulysses_. Joyce's book has now twice in recent years been messed around with by dubiously-motivated editors--more recently, the \\"Reader's Edition\\" that was the subject of a wrangle in court to suppress it--which is an absurd indignity to be visited on one of the touchstones of 20th-century fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great genius, granted, but what he did with his genius is something that doesn't appeal to me. Dangling the snotgreen stuff at the beginning of the book is not what I would call an inviting beginning. Yes, it's a marvel of writing, but I do not like what it is being marvelous about, or at. It's like a beautiful women who farts a lot but doesn't give a damn, because she knows her bosoms are so fetching. Well, fetching bosoms can take a woman only so far, just as fetching writing-- even a genius's writing-- can take a book so far. (IMHO). So yes, I like Joyce's writing's beauty and I like its fetching sensations, but I do not like his artistic manners and I do not like the liberties he takes with my attention-- which he sure knows how to catch, but so what. So can Flaubert (a greater writer, imho), and so can Proust (almost ditto).With all that out of the way I'll not-grudgingly say you probably have to read Ulysses, because, first, it sits like a dead weight in the midst of modern writing, and, second (if you are a writer), so you could steal some of Joyce's marvelous writing technique. But I would not read him more than once.AM"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Probably every avid reader feels compelled at some time in life to read \\"Ulysses\\", especially as it was voted the best work of fiction of the 20th century at the turn of this millenium.The style of writing throughout the book is usually referred to as \\"stream of consciousness\\". This method has been subsequently employed in other works such as \\"To The Lighthouse\\" and \\"The sound and the Fury\\". However, in my opinion, these latter two works used the style much more succesfully than Joyce.If you are currently reading \\"Ulysses\\" at the moment, expect a very patchy book. The second half is , in general, better than the first half, with the two penultimate chapters \\"Cabman's shelter\\" and \\"Ithaca\\" standing out from the rest. After that, the description of birth in \\"Oxen in the sun\\" is also excellent , as is the part dsecribing Paddy Dignam's funeral early in the book. As to the rest of the book, I believe there is little to recommend it.Opinion tends to be polarized about \\"Ulysses\\" . Its severest critics suggest that it is only praised by those who are scared to be criticized for not understanding the book, a sort of \\"emperor's new clothes\\" scenario. There is, however, more than a grain of truth in this opinion. It does seem incredible that a book with so much \\"padding\\" could be so highly thought of. It might have made a very good book of around 200 pages, but one does have the sensation that Joyce is taking his readers for a ride in many parts. ( Of course, his ultimate send up of his readers was \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"! ). Furthermore, the much lauded sense of humour is overblown. At best, this is a mildly amusing book with one or two laugh out loud lines. To label it as \\"very funny\\" is pretentiousness itself. Most of the humour is also of the \\"toilet\\" variety.On the positive side, there are some interesting passages as mentioned above. However, the main interest lies in seeing this new attempt at a style of writing , and to try to fathom out why this book has become the \\"darling\\" of the ( maybe \\"so-called\\" ) intellectuals.

The second time you read it, you will begin to suspect that Joyce is actually writing about the contours of your own mind. The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905.

Nevertheless, Joyce's use of the supernatural is all too often mistaken for social commentary in Ulysses. Below, it will be proven that Ulysses's Surrealist overtones and views on hate are not evidence of Joyce's surrender to love. This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) the Surrealist views of Ulysses's protagonist, Tom Joad, (2) Joyce's triumphant use of satire in the work, and (3) the author's employment of human nature, showing the influence of the the British Modernist school.First, Joyce's male sympathies are evident in Ulysses. To indicate that Ichabod Stephenson is the work's villain, the author makes his dialogue simple. Ishmael Maxwell is a famous character for this very reason; it is also meaningful that scholars--by seeing him as an avatar of Joyce's Minimalist views--have misinterpreted the character King Adams's role in the book.Furthermore, consider that Ulysses was not so much written by Joyce as belched forth in a fit of sublime inspiration. Ulysses's use of incest is in keeping with its Constructivist point-of-view. Captain Stephenson is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of Joyce's 18th century influences show through.Last, Ulysses cannot be fully understood without examination of the post Minimalist school of Roman literature. Many teens see the book's closing scene as the most enduring; I, however, do not. Nick Daniel is a witless character for this very reason; this is definitely why One-Eyed Caulfield is such a monumental character.It's easy to forget that Ulysses was the most brilliant work of its time. Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book. Though contemporaries found Joyce's use of dystopic future-vision ponderous, history will vindicate Ulysses. Q. E. D. -- Quite easily done.The End"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"So we all know that Ulysses is amazing, best novel of the 20th century. And the Gabler edition is the most accurate version out there.

I read it with the annotated version as a guide. It was work but it was fun work. Here are a few things people never talk about with Ulysses:1. It's a very, very funny book2. At it's heart, it's about a young man trying to recover from the death of his mother and a middle aged man trying to cope with his marital crisis and the buried sadness over his dead son and father. Nothing overly obscure or elitist or intellectual there, I don't think.3. The verbal pyrotechnics serve the story. Joyce wanted to describe one day and make it entertaining. All the literary references serve the purpose of adding richness, depth, timelessness and universality to a story about ordinary Dublin citizens wandering around on a warm early summer's day.4. Ultimately, this book is a love story--the least sentimental love story ever written but it's about Stephen's conflicted love for his mother, Molly and Poldy's conflicted love for each other, and Joyce's conflicted love for Ireland. The book is about, as Stephen says, \\"the affirmation of the human spirit\\". He's not being sarcastic when he says that.Ulysses is a novel in brilliant technicolor. I've read nearly all the major literary classics and they are all in black and white by comparison."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I started this book, I must admit it was slow going. I was never a big fan of Joyce. \\"Dubliners\\" was cold and a bit too precious for me. \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" was likewise nothing to crap your pants over. So it was solely with a sense of responsibility to literary tradition that I finally opened my age-old copy of \\"Ulysses\\" to see what all the fuss was about.Immediately I hated it as I've hated few books before. Dense and uncommunicative. Sure it had stream of consciousness and all that - but this really was perfected by Faulkner, etc. - or so I thought.I kept reading - and reading and reading and reading. There came a time about 150 pages into this almost 700 page monster that I seriously considered doing my book physical harm. I thought of throwing it or ripping it or even burning it. However, good sense prevailed and I just kept at it.Then, the epiphany!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" doesn't just mirror Homer's epic but the reader actually reenacts it in the very process of understanding the book. Sure, the text is hard and Joyce doesn't take you by the hand - but it's meant to be that way. In the very difficult process of making meaning out of the text we become an integral part of the text and its meaning. The book is about the experience of literature more than it's about Mr. Bloom or Stephan Dedalus. In effect, you become Ulysses, yourself, and your very difficulties in understanding parallel the hero's difficulties finding his way home.What emerges after such a discovery is still a difficult and - at times - frustrating book. However, it is unquestionably a work of genius. Moreover, it goes far beyond the generation of stream of consciousness. The modes of communication are so varied here that each chapter almost reads like a new book. View points are important as well as the parallel structures they build cumulatively, however, the very mode of communication, itself, is of the story. Moreover, the honesty of the character portrayals is shocking. These are real people to a degree we rarely if ever see portrayed. We see everything Bloom does - from pontificate to use the bathroom.To anyone having difficulty with this book, I advise you keep reading. Promise yourself that you'll finish this book. Then you can hate or love it - whatever you want. Just finish.Now that Joyce actually makes sense, I wonder if I should go back to his early work or on to \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" - that monster of textuality that goes even further than \\"Ulysses.\\" I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet - but I will be. I will be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce is the most talented user of the English language since Shakespeare. His use of language is dazzling in its inventiveness and sophistication, and the sonic qualities of his writing are the equal of any poet. 'Ulysses' is rich, beautiful, moving, and evocative; the cleverness of the novel is associated with a profoundly human and humane sensibility.Often, this 'modernist' novel is contrasted with 'realist' novels, as though Joyce was doing something strange and different, but I don't think that's true - on the contrary, if a realist novel is one that communicates reality, then the stream-of-consciousness passages of 'Ulysses' are the high-water mark of the realist prose tradition, because they do something that no-one else has ever really managed - persuasively communicate his characters' experiences and thoughts from within. And there's more about the reality of Dublin life in 1904 than you would get from a dozen other novels of the period. He's not writing something other than a realist novel - he's doing it bigger and better than anyone else.BUT - it's not an easy read. The density of the prose makes it like reading poetry, and it's hard work just as reading an 800-page poem would be hard work. Furthermore, it's not all equally good; some of Joyce's experiments with language are less successful than others - the surrealist chapter springs to mind as a weak bit. When you're half-way through one of the less successful chapters, and it's both hard work *and* rather boring, it can feel a little bit like banging your head against a brick wall.So - know what you're getting yourself into. This book isn't for everyone, and you're not going to finish it in the course of a a one-week beach holiday in Marbella. But if you think you're up to it - have a go. It may just really annoy you. Or it may be the most rewarding book you'll ever read.Harry"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I think the Gabler edition of Ulysses is great, if you are looking to buy a new copy of it, please beware! In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble. I'm posting this review Oct 2005, so I hope this warning will not be necessary at a future date."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am glad that I read \\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce as part of a graduate level course so that I had a professor who could explain all the intricacies and idiosyncracies of Joyce's masterpiece. Had I tried to read this novel on my own, I'm sure I would've given up very early on. Its stream-of-consciousness style not only defies the laws of narratrion, but Joyce expected his readers to be as intelligent as he was, which is just not the average case in today's society. It is easy to see why this novel has been the center of such controversy and praise ever since it was published; it truly stands alone in the pantheon of modern literature. As challenging and frustrating as it can be, it is a rewarding and intriguing read.So how does one sum up a nearly 800 page novel that follows the seemingly mundance events of one day (June 16, 1904) in Dublin, Ireland? \\"Ulysses\\" is the tale primarily of two men, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, whose paths propitiously cross late within the book. Stephen, a young intellectual, is stuck in an unrewarding job as a teacher. Bloom, a half-Jewish worker, is stuck in an unhappy marriage and who finds joy in the smallest and oddest of places. His day's journey through Dublin takes him to a funeral, a bar where he very nearly gets into a fight, a maternity ward, and a house of ill repute before he returns home for the evening. Along the way, readers are introduced to a wide cast of supporting characters who flesh out Bloom's adventures and play symbolic roles based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\". Readers are also given a vast insight into the history of the English language as well as questions that concern the very essence of humanity. The novel finishes with the perspective of Bloom's wife, Molly, who sheds some interesting light on Bloom's fears and presentiments.There is truly no other work like \\"Ulysses\\" in the history of the English novel and there will likely never be another quite like it. Joyce's command of the English language was phenomenal and his powers are at full display in chapter after chapter, whether in parodies of various writing styles or mocking the vapid putrescence of romantic literature. Leopold Bloom springs to life and his journey, while challenging and difficult, is definitely worth pursuing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Five stars for Joyce and Ulysses, but boos to Amazon and Kindle, because the Kindle link provided with the ad for the Gabler edition leads to a Kindle version of the older Random House edition, which has many textual differences.

If it is available on Kindle, please replace the present Kindle link with the proper one. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course it's difficult; it was meant to be so. However, Joyce's desire to keep critics writing about him by making Ulysses a dense read is not reason to disparage what he was capable of doing. Another reviewer states that the book has neither plot nor story; this is false and misleading.Ulysses is not for the faint-hearted nor for the prudish. Certainly it remains on college reading lists because of its multiple layers of meanings, which few readers, if any, can grasp at first reading. To understand everything probably requires multiple readings, secondary sources, and/or formal study. Also, reading the entirety of Homer's Odyssey is a great help, just for seeing the parallels Joyce was driving at. But many jokes and innuendoes can be understood immediately, and if you are truly reading the text, you can determine what is going on. But this is never a book that you can comprehend by merely skimming along, waiting for the narrative to clear everything up for you.The effort is worth it, but don't attempt it if your motive is simply to add another title to your \\"List of Important Books That I've Read.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses has got to be the most difficult thing I have ever read. Being as tough as it is to read, I can see why their is a lot of negative reviews about this book. Most people feel for a book to be good it has to be action packed and fastly paced with a bunch of characters that you like.Well Ulysses has really none of those things, unless you can identify with Bloom or Stephen then you'll probably like them. When you pick up Ulysses you need to get some help. I read the guide by Gilbert along with the text and it helped me a lot. Without a guide Ulysses can be even harder than than it normally is.You also should not expect any major or huge events to happen. Nobody dies or anything exciting like that.Lastly you need to get into a mindset that what your going to be reading is extremly hard, but with a little patience it can be extremly rewarding.Now, without further ado, I will review Ulysses. I gave the book five stars, but it is not an unqualified five star review. When reading Ulysses in it's entirety, some parts are classic while other parts just seem unneccesary. For example, the Hades episode is the best in the book and probably the best example of realistic writing in the english language. Most of the other episodes are also great, but a few are just a burden to read. The Oxen of the Sun episode in my opinion is pointless. Joyce seems to like the fact that he can write in middle english, so he does. I'm no expert on middle english, but it's damn hard to read and it disrupts any flow the book had. If you can sort out the slang at the end of Oxen of the Sun then I congragulate you, because it was totally lost on me. The Ithaca episode is another example. It is told with a series of questions and are answered in the most drawn out and scientific way possible. Maybe Joyce could have been best served using a diffrent style. Stephen's Shakespeare rant also seems unnecessary and the episode where Bloom is trying to sell an ad to the newspaper is hard to follow.Ever other episode is expertly written and is a delight to read. The pitfalls of a few episodes are more than made up for with the 14 or so episodes that are expertly written.What Joyce does with language in this book is amazing. He is a true master of the english language and a master of a multitude of diffrent styles. He writes magnificently but sometimes he can't seem to help but show off his skills.And to those who think this book is utterly impossible and if anyone says they finished this book is lying, well I swear to god in heaven that I read this book cover to cover. It was no easy task, it took me a long time, but I did finish it. I don't claim to come close to total comprehension but I did read it all the way through.I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't analytically challenged, has an attention span of at least one hour, and won't be offended if a writer changes styles every chapter. I highly recommend it. If you get through it you can be a literary snob for the rest of your life. Did you finish Ulysses, I did."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I suppose it is pretty hard to add anything to this monstrous string of reviews. But I will comment because (obviously like so many others) I found this book to be very important. The fact that so many reviews exist shows that this book has effected a lot of people (enough to expend their precious energies writing about it). As you can see, not many really ride the middle ground about it. People seem to love it passionately or they hate it passionately. This should be enough to recommend it to anyone. We all should be after books that are going to change us, challenge us, effect our lives and loves. This is a book that has done that for a great many people. If you have not read it, take the time. I do not think that you'll sit in your easy chair and say 'well, it was okay,' and flip on the television.Personally, I found the book to be lively and entertaining. It was also challenging and arduous. Sometimes I couldn't put it down and sometimes I couldn't pick it up. Sometimes I thought it was a stupid book and sometimes I thought it was the best work of fiction that I had read. Ulysses is overall 'real.' It discusses truth, it changes a lot, like life. All the characters can be seen as stable in their lives, yet metaphysically sort of lost and wandering. That is like Ulysses. It is also a lot like you and I. There are jarring events, changes of style, unexpected devices and layers and layers of erudition. There are also normal everyday joes going about life as usual, to which we can all relate. It was not easy, and that is like life, also. Like life, it has a lot to teach you. And you can come back to this book many times and still find it fresh. It probably will seem an entirely new beast when you return.Unlike some of the reviewers, I wouldn't recommend annotations. Trust yourself and trust Joyce in undertaking the work. Perhaps you'll miss things here or there. That is okay. You'll still 'get it,' in the end, if you make it. Part of it is seeing if you can make it, so you sort of fail in your test of yourself if you immediately resort to consulting some sort of 'dictionary of Joyce.' For anyone that sees this book as too daunting, let me just say that I'm not an English major or in a literature related field. I'm a music student, just a plain old undergraduate joe that read this book. I read the book without annotations except for one period where I was stuck and thought I didn't understand. I checked the annotations out from the library and I found that I did understand (at least as well as the annotator) and that I just needed to keep going to figure it out, just like in finding out how a Dickens plot is going to unfold. I would recommend against taking that step. Leave the annotations on the shelf. I'd recommend that you, another plain old non - literature joe or jane, try it.

He has to pass through many dangers, including the cave of the giant one-eyed cyclops and the magical woman who turns men into pigs, before he can return home to his faithful wife and free her from her unwanted suitors.Well, not exactly, as the car rental commercials say. Our hero is Leo Bloom, a Jew in Ireland married to an Irish sexpot named Mollie. The evil cyclops awaiting Leo is a big one-eyed antisemite, and the cave is a bar. The woman who turns men into pigs is a dominatrix. The faithful wife is in bed right now with a man named Blazes Boylan. And our droll hero is avoiding home because he gets a perverse pleasure out of the whole situation.Then there's the language of James Joyce. Buss her, wap in rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell. isn't whether or not to get the Cliff Notes, the question is which to read first, one chapter at a time, the book or the explanation. If you read the book first, you're giving yourself the chance to get it yourself. If you read the notes first, you'll have a much better idea what you're reading.In a book that sometimes makes you dislike humanity, as when some stupid antisemite (there are many, in fact almost everyone) gives Leo a little dig, the single most beautiful moment comes in the 14th chapter. I'm not referring to Send us, bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit, or to Hoopsa, boyaboy, hoopsa! The most beautiful writing in the book is when Mrs Purefoy has her baby.Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders....And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe... You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!It makes you think that life might be worth living after all, and that maybe God will one day say the same to you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an undergraduate, I tried and failed to read James Joyce's Ulysses the conventional way - I think it took me six months to finish chapter 1. Having treated myself to the audiobook, I can say that it's a completely different experience - Jim Norton's and Marcella Riordan's masterful recording really brings the text to life. On a purely practical level, the lengthy stream-of-consciousness bits make a whole lot more sense when they're read with the intonations of natural speech, and the variation in vocal tone makes it much easier to stay engaged in sections that otherwise tend towards the soporific. Most impressive are the 'voices' Jim Norton does for all the different characters - Stephen Dedalus's 'thoughts' are all done in a low-pitched deadpan monotone that perfectly captures his personality, while Buck Mulligan is loud, brash and has a much stronger Irish accent (this difference in volume is large enough to be a potential problem for someone listening through headphones). Norton's skill is particularly noticeable in 'ensemble' scenes such as the library, where he has to switch voice every couple of lines. I've got the Oxford Classics edition of the book (1922 text) and it's almost identical to the recording - very occasionally there's a word or two that's different. This time round I'm actually really enjoying Ulysses - who would've thought."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read the reviews. I've seen the complaints. &quot;It doesn't mean a thing... I can't understand it... It's just a bunch of drivel...&quot; All are opinions that anyone who has read the book is certainly entitled to. As for all the scholars out there who say that there are hidden meanings in every sentence, well, that's your opinion too. And you're more than welcome to scour &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the rest of your natural life looking for pieces to Joyce's grand puzzle. But I'm going to offer something a little different - those who would scour the novel for such meanings are missing the point in almost the same way as those who toss it aside as incomprehensible.In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, we are given access to the inner-consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom. They are normal people living ordinary lives in early 20th century Dublin. They go to work, go to the bathroom, walk the streets, greet people, and think about their lives. They mull over details of their own lives that are so personal to them that they could mean nothing to anyone else. And if you think about it, isn't that what we all do? If someone were to open up your head and read your thoughts, they might say the same thing - &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; But we also consider the things that affect us all; love, death, loss, and hate, among others. Those are the thoughts that would carry weight and meaning for anyone, and the characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot; ponder these things as we all might. We cannont completely become them, and thus we cannot completely understand everything they think of. But they hit upon enough major truths so that there is meaning for anyone. Their adventures through Dublin would have made an interesting story on their own - being able to see inside their minds takes the novel to a completely different level."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why do people who don't like Ulysses always lambaste those who do? You have every right to like and dislike what you please, and so do I. Why the name calling? I wouldn't call myself an intellectual and I'm certainly no \\"literary luminary,\\" but I love the book. For me, it's not about mythic parallels or stylistic experimentation or esoteric theories of art-it's about the richness, the absolute miracle, of human experience. Whatever else you can say about Joyce's intent, he wanted to show us life. And every time, for example, Bloom wonders whether black reflects or refracts light, I see life-the sort of life (banal, uncertain, driven by the demands of the flesh, often a joy, sometimes thankfully relieved by humor) that I live. Joyce (I think) succeeded in giving us a very simple but profound truth: every moment of life is sacred. Eternity, heaven and hell, God, the whole shebang, are right here around and within us all the time. And we spend 99% of our time distracting ourselves in one way or other.Bring your sense of humor!

The more you read it, the more you get out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am writing this review on the 100th anniversary of the most famous day in the life of the wandering Jewish Dubliner Leopold Bloom, who was created by James Joyce and immortalized in Ulysses. \\"Bloomsday,\\" as this day is called in some circles, prompted me to once again revisit this vast, difficult, and important book.I should note that I have only read Ulysses from cover to cover once, and that was more than 15 years ago. But I refer to it and re-read parts of it periodically, even though the years appear to have dampened some of my enthusiasm for this brick of a book.The more I think about Ulysses, the more I decide that most of the value of reading and understanding the book (two very different things, by the way) comes from its ambition and the impact it has had on 20th century literature. This is the work that -- probably to the chagrin of literature students everywhere -- more or less invented the stream of consciousness style of literature, and which literary historians say marked the start of the modern era in English literature. The narrative, a nearly 800-page examination into the events in Leopold Bloom's life on June 16, 1904, is dense but also very compelling, and the language is often crisp and colorful.Unfortunately, the language is even more often a bizarre maze of metaphors, references, and descriptions so inaccessible that some scholars think they may contain some kind of secret code. At one point, the erotic and deflating soliloquy of Molly Bloom (Leopold's wife) takes up something like 25,000 words unmarred by a single punctuation mark -- a section long enough to be published separately as a novella.Without a doubt, a similar book written today by an unknown talent would never find its way the shelves of the neighborhood Books-A-Million without first shedding 300 or 400 pages under the red ink of some unfortunate editor. There's also little doubt that the modern literary cannon is better off for the fact that that didn't happen when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses with the help of the annotations, but soon left those behind. The horror stories that I had heard of the difficulty of the book were unfounded, and I enjoyed every moment of the text. Having read the Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I was used to Joyce's style, or so I thought. But in Ulysses I discovered that stream of consciousness could be taken to a new and deeper level. Joyce did not mean for us to grasp every allusion, therefore annotations are not really necessary. By reading Ulysses, I also managed to gain a new insight into the Odyssey, and found new undertones withing Homer's work. People had told me that at the age of 16 and 17 it would be impossible to read Ulysses. I disagree. Length does not make a book more difficult to read -- Walden Pond is, at times, harder to understand than Ulysses. When I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptiness, for I had been living in the mind of Leopold Bloom. It was as if part of me had been taken away. In the future, I will definitely reread Ulysses, and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is for people that have not read this novel and are frightened by it.Greatest novel of all time, blah blah blah. Forget the academic wankery that has encased this novel like a black, shiny coffin. Joyce never meant this novel to be read with reverential nods and oh so serious frowns. This is a novel that is bursting with atmosphere and life.In its essence, this novel attempts two major tasks: to inflate one utterly ordinary day in the life of a human being to epic proportions, and to do so by undertaking a different writing-experiment for each chapter.The \\"epic inflation\\" aspect is absolutely fascinating. Mr Leopold Bloom spends an entire day wandering around Dublin for a bit, then comes back home. Absolutely nothing \\"epic\\", in the usual sense, actually occurs here. He encounters a spiritual son in the form of the slightly malnourished, youthful, pseudo-intellectual Stephen Dedalus...but the encounter doesn't really lead anywhere.Rather, it is the point of the novel to inflate the simple things in life to something epic. Taking the Odyssey as its skeleton (and you really should be familiar with the Odyssey before attempting this book), Joyce turns each tiny incident during the day (in pretty much \\"real time\\") into an epic event with its own incredible atmosphere and drama. Even Bloom sitting on the toilet, going to the post-office, or drinking instant chocolate become massive epic events.To some degree this is slightly self-mocking. However, the novel makes you see your own life in a slightly different way. Maybe there are no \\"dull\\" days in our lives; from a certain point of view even the most mundane stuff, like dropping off something at the post office, or drinking Ovaltine, becomes miraculous.Secondly, there is the experimentation. The fact that each chapter is a totally different experiment gives you a real sense of curiosity about the novel. What is coming next? Stream of consciousness wackiness? A play? Random newspaper headlines? The division of the book into different experiments means that, even if you don't like one chapter, you can read on in the hopes that the next chapter will be more to your taste.Think of it as being like a concept album. Even if you don't dig Within You Without You, When You're Sixty-Four is just around the corner.Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the novel. Even if sometimes you don't totally get what's happening, you get a strong sense of Dublin c. 1904, with people lunching on gorgonzola sandwiches and sherry at pubs, people wandering along Sandymount Strand and buying sweets, people going to the turkish bath and buying scented soap.There is also the unmistakeable tang of the Homeric Aegean. Dublin is near the sea, like Troy, and you don't forget it. Whether wandering the sandy beach, eating headless sardines from a tin, or watching drunken soldiers wandering along the street at night, the sea is never far away.Don't be put off this book. Wallow away in something that is truly an epic \\"show about nothing\\". Speaking of which, what is this book comparable to in the modern world?\\"Seinfeld\\", with its excruciating minutiae about life in New York City being raised to the mock-epic level, whether it's George lying about his job or Elaine wondering if a rabbi is gossiping about her.\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", with its exuberant, youthful experimentation with the very bedrock of music albeit with a playful unpretentiousnessmost oddly, \\"24\\", with real time coverage of events in such a way that every single hour has something epic happening in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is great fun. It takes a bit more work to read than most books, just as it takes a bit more work to play tennis than it does to play catch. You shouldn't feel compelled to put the work in, any more than you should feel compelled to learn an unusually difficult sport. But people who do put the work in and who have a good time doing it shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it either. It's a pleasure to follow the interweaving lines of the Sirens chapter, for instance, and anyone who does it will see that the chapter is alive in a way that almost nothing else is in literature. Joyce is a terrific comic writer and a terrific creator of vivid, complicated characters. But he requires the reader to put in some extra effort to enjoy how good he is, and I can't blame anyone who gives up after a few pages and refuses to go any further. On the other hand, I've noticed that people who don't like Joyce's approach seem to want to attack people who do. This is silly. Again, it's like hating people for playing basketball just because you prefer skateboarding. Both the Joyce lovers and the Joyce haters should lighten up a bit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A book deserving to be thoroughly studied and a milestone in development of English language currently known, but a common reader like me can afford but a hasty and superficial eagle eye, and most references and connections would have been lost to me without the diagram by Stuart Gilbert quoted in the introduction of Penguin edition.A full and unique mastership of language results in a wonderful balance between fictional and technical , at ease with each employed style besides the contrasts between the different narrative techniques employed in the various chapters, which depicts the wide variety of microcultures composing the fragmented Irish society during British occupation.Many years ago I read a book, whose title The Cardinal, by Henry Morton, about the career of a Catholic American priest with Irish origins. The first half of the book is set in the Boston Irish community, and I have been impressed by how many \\"Irishnesses\\" in the book (which I read in an Italian translation) can be traced back to Joyce's Ulysses (I still remember the pun Rows of Cast Steel = Rose of Castille).An example of how a local tale becomes universal literature, and a mandatory step in understanding English language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think there is one sentence in Ulysses that sums up Joyce's intention perfectly: \\"Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\\"This really is a great book, full of humor and insight and what I can only describe as those little sparks of recognition you get when you see your own life in great literature. And I think it even has something akin to a real spiritual revelation we desperately need in the West (see the quote above). But there's no denying that Joyce was a sadist, linguistically speaking. Like all Irish writers I've ever read about, Joyce had mixed feelings about English. It was not his true native language and, while he loved it, he was always knew that it was a kind of shackle on his country. The issue comes up in A Portrait (when young Stephen bristles that he knows the language better than the English priest who's teaching it) and it reappears very early in Ulysses.At breakfast, Haines confounds the old milk woman with his speech in Irish (it's French, for all she knows). In his mind, Stephen associates the old woman with all of Ireland, and Haines' command of the Irish language is emblematic of his status as conqueror (he's conquered the land and assimilated the language, and now he's come to plunder the culture! Haines is in Ireland to collect folk tales). Joyce may not have embraced the Irish cause like many of his contemporaries, but he had his own more subtle form of revolt. He wanted to bind the English speaking world with one of it's own shackles. In Richard Ellman's biography, someone tells Joyce he demands too much of his readers. He flatly replies that his only demand was that his readers spend their whole lives reading him. He wanted to make us all slaves! Just read those two mind-bending sentences near the beginning of the Oxen of the Sun chapter and imagine what sadistic pleasure Joyce must have felt writing them. You can almost hear him shout, \\"take that!\\" And any time you come to a particularly difficult section of the book, just imagine Joyce there beside you saying, \\"Hey, don't look at me. It's YOUR language.\\"I'm sure what throws most people is the third chapter that begins \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible...\\" Up to then, things have been pretty clear, except for the occasional shifts from dialogue to thought, which Joyce does without giving us those helpful little \`he said's and \`he thought's. He doesn't even give us quotation marks (he didn't use them because he thought they were ugly, by the way). We've seen-and \\"seen\\" is the key word...we have not been told by a narrator...it's as if we are there watching it all-we've seen Stephen have breakfast in the tower, walk with Mulligan and Haines to the bathing area, teach his class, and talk with Deasy. But suddenly we find ourselves inside his head along with Kant, Schopenhaur, Shakespeare, Milton, the Bible, the Catholic Mass, early Christian heresies, Irish mythology, on and on. It gets confusing to say the least.Do you have to know as much about all this stuff as Stephen to understand the book? It probably wouldn't hurt, but I certainly don't. The main thing is to understand that STEPHEN understands it all, and yet he is still struggling. His mother has died and he's asking a simple question, \\"what does it all mean?\\" This is the question of the book. What does life mean? How should one live? The answer the book gives is: life begins when you understand that we are all one. Stephen and Bloom, two completely different people, are one. Religion, myth, and all the great symbols that spring up across the globe are so similar because human life is essentially the same everywhere. Joyce told a friend that he chose The Odyssey as a model for his own book because Homer created the most complete character in all of literature: Odysseus is a father, a husband, a lover, a warrior, a politician. In short, he is Bloom: a completely ordinary man. Joyce showed us that ordinary life, \\"intensely regarded\\", is the stuff of myth.It's not always easy (although much of it is, if you read carefully...and compared to Finnegans Wake it's practically Dr. Seuss). But it's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of those big, mad bellwethers of a book that X will tell you is the biggest, best, most important blah blah blah and Y will tell you is a load of badly written tripe. Neither X nor Y tend to notice that the book consciously encourages both responses...but, well, I'll get back to the academic riffing in a minute.I first tried to read Ulysses aged about 14 (I was an annoying little boy that way) and didn't get very far. The first three chapters are set in and around the mind of Stephen Dedalus, one of the most ridiculously clever and over-educated characters ever conceived, as he takes breakfast with some friends, teaches in a school some miles south of Dublin and walks along a beach. Along the way, his mind ruminates on subjects as diverse as 16th century underworld slang, his dead mother, and something he calls &quot;the ineluctable modality of the visible&quot; which I'm still struggling with. But he's a curiously ambiguous character, this Stephen; he fancies himself as a poet and rebel but when, on the beach, he picks his nose, he has a quick look around to see that nobody's watching before he smears the snot on a rock. (Joyce likes to poke fun at pretension this way - although he doesn't suggest that Stephen's ideas or rebel stance are completely hollow, either.)The 14-year-old me didn't get that far. I gave up. It wasn't until I was 19 or so that I got as far as chapter four and encountered a Mr. Bloom, pottering around the kitchen making breakfast, that I started to get a grip. Bloom is one of the most likeable characters in fiction. He's a quiet, rather shy, oddly intelligent advertising salesman married to a voluptuous siren of a wife, Molly. Either you're prepared to go the distance with Bloom, or else cast the book aside with a hollow oath, because he's about to spend the entire day walking around Dublin. Nothing will happen except that a man will be buried, a baby will get born, and Bloom will help Stephen when the latter gets into a drunken fracas with some British soldiers. (Ireland was still part of the Union in 1904, and Dublin was a garrison town. Many non-Irish readers concentrate on Joyce's innovation or wit or technical whatever, but Joyce is extremely historically aware, and Ulysses, like all his other books, is riddled with the traces of English domination. These add to the book, rather than diminish it.)Readers who like those clanky, tinpot contraptions known as &quot;plots&quot; may get a tad frustrated. Leaving aside Joyce's gifts for parody (a _tad_ too indulged, in my opinion), the, if you like, human interest in Ulysses is in the details of the to-ing and fro-ing between the characters. A quite banal conversation turns out to have all sorts of fascinating undercurrents; Bloom, who is Jewish and therefore even more of an outsider than Stephen, is extremely good at detecting the hints and shifts in the tones of the people he meets. He keeps running into two things that cause him particular discomfort: anti-Semitic remarks, and reminders that his wife is about to sleep with another man.Ulysses is about language, but that makes it sound like it's some godawful lumbering doorstop written by an English professor. (John Barth, come on down!) It doesn't feel abstract at all; it's full of sights (the band of old sweat inside Bloom's hat), smells (restaurants, horse urine, flowers) and especially sounds (cats, printing presses, trams). I can't think of any other book which transports you so completely to a different place and time. (It might've helped that I grew up in Dublin and knew most of the places that Joyce is writing about.) Borges described Joyce's prose style, at least in the earlier half of the book, as &quot;strong and delicate&quot; and that's a good description.As the day wears on, the book starts to rumble at the foundations and it lurches with increasing unpredictability from style to style. Joyce is making a point about language; that things are altered by the manner in which we describe them. This can get a bit wearisome after a while, but when it works well - as in the chapter where the doings of a young girl on a beach are narrated in the style of a girl's magazine story - it can be very funny and rather touching. The book closes with a mighty tour de force as Molly Bloom sits up and thinks about her life and her curious husband.Okay, that's the beginner's guide. My personal opinion? It's the best Irish book, a constant wonder, irritation and delight to read, and a stunning effort of imagination and intelligence by the most significant and most lavishly talented Irish writer. 20th and 21st century Irish culture is unthinkable without it. I'm grateful that it's there. What else is to be said?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I picked this up for a group read of Ulysses. I figured it would be convenient to have it on the computer so I could look up all the references I didn't understand, and the price was certainly right. Unfortunately, as I came to realize, this edition of the book is missing pieces of text. I probably wouldn't have noticed this, except that when I googled one of the references that I didn't get, I came up with a preview of a book called Ulysses Annotated, which describes in detail the meaning of all the references. As I read, I noticed that in several places there were references noted that I hadn't seen in the text. Finally, I got annoyed and googled the exact line that preceded an area of missing text, and found that some lines of verse had been omitted from my edition of the book. It's a shame, since I was enjoying the clear formatting and the ease of use that the Kindle edition was giving me, but since it's not really a book that I want to spend money on, I guess I'll be giving Project Gutenberg's version a try."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stuff you probably want to know:1. It's read by two people: one guy, who does absolutely everything (including Molly) up till the last chapter, then the last chapter, which is read entirely by a woman.2. The guy is supremely talented at reading. It's a dramatic reading, in which he imitates the voices of the others and tries to get into it. I would regard his imitation of the voices of others as supremely believable.3. He has a light British accent (London), but switches to a convincing Irish brogue when reading straight spoken dialogue for most characters. Excellent French and Latin pronunciation. His Italian and Spanish are less successful. The woman is certifiably Irish.4. There are no sound effects (footsteps, keys, etc.), but there are a few songs interlarded, usually at the beginning of each CD.5. If you're a Joyce scholar, you are doubtless using the Gabler edition of 1986, WHICH WASN'T THE EDITION USED FOR THIS. I think they're actually using the 1922 edition! Anyhow, this is a constant irritant for serious Joyce fanatics, as, since you are doubtless using Gabler, there'll be something in almost every paragraph that's just a whit different. It's a constant distraction, alas!6. He reads it a little fast for my taste (especially in Circe).7. Yes, it is totally unabridged.8. There are 22 CD's total.9. You should buy it. I had read Ulysses twice before I got it, and going through it with this CD set really opened up the book to me, in a way I couldn't have gotten with any other type of ancillary aid. It was like reading the book for the first time! Wasn't so incomprehensible after all!I should warn you that one thing you might find thoroughly infuriating is that the title tracks / id tags of the CD tracks are totally in chaos. It's so bizarre, it smacks of sabotage. (For example, the title track of the 1st track of the 2nd (!) CD is: \\"Time for lunch. 1 p.m. After Dignam's funeral . . .\\" While the actual content is the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible\\" passage. It's craaaaazy!Rest assured, this is just the names your computer sees: everything is there, and in the correct order. My point is that if you plan on porting everything over to your iPod, you're gonna have some tedious clerical work ahead of you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"O.k. to start with...for all of you out there who are interested in reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; but are intimidated by all of the rest of you out there who say it's unreadable, take my advice. Read this book. It's absolutely ridiculous to say this book can't be read. I can't say you're going to find it interesting or enjoyable, but you can read it.There are people who would have you believe you have to wage a massive campaign of pre-&quot;Ulysses&quot; study before delving into Joyce's novel. I've heard it's necessary to read biographies of Joyce, read all of his other literature, read about the history of Dublin, read Greek mythology...even study Dublin city maps!!! Don't you believe any of this. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is perfectly approachable having read none of the above. I admit that reading &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; first is helpful, and at least having some passing knowledge of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; won't hurt, but being familiar with these other works will only help you appreciate some of Joyce's nuances. Being unfamiliar with them will not prevent you from digesting &quot;Ulysses.&quot;Now, for the book itself. Is &quot;Ulysses&quot; good? That's become an almost irrelevant question to ask. Do you have to like &quot;Ulysses?&quot; No. Do you have to admit that it is the greatest novel ever written? No. Anyone denying that the book was influential in altering the course of literature would just be foolish. However, I don't think &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the be-all and end-all of 20th Century literature, and the new ground that Joyce broke would have been broken anyway had he not done it first. He was certainly an innovator, but other authors (Faulkner comes to mind) use Joyce's modernist approach to fiction and do it better.For ultimately, Joyce is a lousy storyteller. Notice I did not say he is a lousy writer. One can't deny the absolute mastery of language apparent in &quot;Ulysses.&quot; But Joyce is almost completely unable to connect with his reader. Parts of this novel come close to doing just that, but in between there are vast numbers of pages of dull, dull prose that set out to be as incomprehensible as possible. What was Joyce afraid of? Was he scared that what he actually had to say wasn't either particulary interesting or profound, so he had to bury it underneath layer after layer of obscure allusions and writing styles? I didn't understand every part of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and I don't believe all of these so-called Joyce experts do either, despite the massive amount of critical study done about it. However, understanding every single part of the novel and understanding the novel are two different things, and I believe I understood &quot;Ulysses.&quot; And what I found is that it's not the beast everyone's made it out to be, but neither is it particulary interesting or profound.In short, I would recommend that everyone read &quot;Ulysses,&quot; if for no other reason than that you can have an opinion on it. I won't be reading it again, so I guess I'll have to just live in ignorance of all the hidden delights Joyce offers his readers. I neither loved it or hated it---there are many books I've enjoyed reading less and many more books I've enjoyed reading much more. Before reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; I was reluctant to state that I didn't like Joyce's writing, feeling that any opinion about Joyce without having read his masterwork would be uneducated. Well, I've read the damn thing now, and I can state with a very educated opinion: &quot;I do not like Joyce's writing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have frequently heard Ulysses proclaimed the best book ever written, but I could never understand why. I purchased this edition of the novel three years ago, and since then it sat on my shelf, a mighty 900 page undertaking that I kept putting off. I was reluctant to read it, for I have often heard how difficult it was to get through. Finally, I have read it, and though I believe it presumptuous to call any one book \\"the best book of all time\\", I certainly believe that Ulysses could claim that title. First off, it is not a difficult read. If you could get through A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, you can get through Ulysses. I heartily recommend this edition because of the brilliant introduction by Declan Kibard. Before I read Ulysses, I could not understand how this could be the best book of all time. According to my understanding, it was a novel detailing, in 900 pages, one day in the life of a Jewish Irishman, Leopold Bloom. A totally unremarkable day at that. After reading Kibard's introduction, I was fiercely eager to begin the novel. In his introduction, totally some 70 pages, Kibard answers the precise question I had: Why would this book be called the best of all time? This book is never boring, and is actually a quite enjoyable read. It is arranged in 18 chapters, and to me, the most astounding aspect of this piece of literature is the fact that every chapter is written in a different style. Joyce wanted to show that \\"originality\\" in terms of style was merely a new arrangement of previous styles, and so shows his brilliance as a writer by changing his technique and method completely in each chapter. It is indeed difficult to believe they were written by the same person. The styles are listed as: Narrative (Young), Catechism (Personal), Monologue (Male), Narrative (Mature), Narcissism, Incubism, Enthymemic, Peristaltic, Dialectic, Labyrinth, Fuga per canonem, Gigantism, Tumescence detumescence, Embryonic development, Hallucination, Narrative (Old), Catechism (Impersonal), Monologue (Female). Some chapters, such as the Cyclops, done in Gigantism, are deliciously satirical and overdone, while others, such as the Lotus-eaters, are sharp and direct. Though Joyce is often called a \\"stream of consciousness writer\\", only a few chapters are the truly chaotic stream of consciousness, such as the Oxen of the Sun, the Proteus, and the Sirens. The culmination of absurdity and abstraction occurs in the massive Circe chapter, a play styled as a hallucination in the brothels of Dublin. This novel is nearly impossible to take in with just one reading, and I will be reading it again shortly. On this note, I would say that I heartily recommend reading Ulysses straight through in its original form, rather than labouring under the weight of the hefty annotated edition. A true masterpiece, one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, quite possibly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The eBook is missing text. I also have a print edition, but I wanted a copy I could read on my phone when i had the time. The part I noticed is missing is the Ballad of Joking Jesus. It's probably missing other text as well."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had heard about Ulysses all through my literature-loving youth. When I was 16 or so, I tried to find Ulysses in the St. Cloud Technical High School Library. It was listed in the card catalog, but it was never on the shelves. Finally, I asked the prim-and-proper old biddy librarian where the book was. She fairly shuddered and asked me with a cockeyed combination of excitement and accusation &quot;why&quot; I wanted to read it. I told her I'd heard it was a great book and so please hand it over. Sure enough, it was in a back room and the old battleaxe crept forth with the book, jacketed in a beautiful red. At home I opened it and tried to make sense out of the first page. I dipped around in it and finally threw it hard as I could against the wall of my bedroom. &quot;This is gibberish junk!&quot; I said to myself. Later, I kept hearing more about the book and thought, &quot;well, maybe I'm just dumb,&quot; which really teed me off. One day I found a book called &quot;Re-Joyce&quot; by Anthony Burgess (of Clockwork Orange fame). He was a Joyce fanatic and wrote a book about how to read Ulysses. And so I read Re-Joyce as I read Ulysses and, wonder of wonders, what an experience! That was back in 1965. I still read Ulysses. It's the one book I re-read more than any other. Oh, and when I look back, way back to my high school library, I know now how Joyce would have roared with merriment at that biddy librarian. He would have been honored in his sly way to see his naughty book kept behind that bun-haired spinster's iron petticoats. Don't give up on Ulysses! Get the Burgess book as a guide, or the Gilbert guide. But don't give up. Riches, great riches, await you!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have listened in the past to the taped rendition of Ulysses, and I pushed my way through it for the bragging rights.

It suddenly makes sense.As a by-the-way, the Naxos packaging is second only to Apple's iPod in the pleasure I got from handling it and opening it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You ever hear that old adage about \\"what don't kill you, makes you stronger\\"? Well, struggling through Ulysses is kinda like that. If you haven't taken a bottle of pain relievers mid-point through the book or perhaps just sprained your wrists trying to hold aloft the 768 page tome, you might just start to understand the methods behind Joyce's madness. But understanding doesn't equal enjoyment.Ulysses, one of the most celebrated and challenging books in the English language has been reduced to one of two things: to the general public, a curiosity, a book of importance that no one would really read or: to Lit majors: the equivalent of a double-dog dare among the Lit-Crit crowd; a book professors assign in order to weed out the weak, who more than likely change majors to something less demanding, like quantum physics. Inevitably, in both circles it has become a book to be endured, not enjoyed.What is the book about? Joyce, a master of the written word *does* appear to have a lot to say about everything, including, but not limited to, religion, politics, sex, and literature. But if there is a flaw in the book (and indeed, it could be argued that the flaw lies with the reader, not the author), it's that Joyce seems more preoccupied with how his story is told, losing sight of the actual subjects. Ulysses is really about WRITING, it seems, and in particular, how well Joyce can do it. The skill involved in the writing often attains that genius status, but too often it feels strangely hollow, a series of breathlessly staged feats of writing skill. In other words, he's showboating.Still, despite Joyce's blatant shouts of \\"look at me!\\", many moments of passion do leak through. Particularly impressive is the final 40 pages or so which takes on a confessional tone that at last attempts to engage the reader emotionally, instead of keeping them at a distance.Reading Ulysses is difficult, to be sure. Joyce drops more obscure references than Dennis Miller after three highballs. Joyce assumes you've read The Odyssey, Dante's The Divine Comedy, the Bible, Hamlet, and, of course the dictionary. He also assumes that you have a passing knowledge of about 6 or 7 languages. But, even if you do have prior knowledge of said works and you know Latin, it cannot help make Ulysses as a whole, an engaging, vital work. It is a towering achievement, yes, but much more of a textbook on writing, which just happens to use the characters of Stephen Daedalus and Leopold Bloom as examples of the styles that Joyce writes in.All said and done though, I would recommend this book as it is unique and it is one of those titles that, like childbirth, has to be experienced to be understood.I would also recommend Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as a superior work of art. It's just as inventive, it's moving and passionate, and it says what it has to say before wearing out it's welcome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Orchises Press edition stands out for three reasons. The first is that it reproduces--with impressive attention to detail--the first edition of Joyce's novel. The second reason is that the large, widemargined pages add the pleasure of reading to the pleasure of reading Ulysses (there is something missing, after all, in the insubstantial, tinytype levity of the paperback editions). Finally, the weight of the paper, the strength of the binding makes this edition one that will last (and you will not, as with the paperback editions, be forced to transcripe all your notes from a book that falls apart after three readings).

Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. &quot;Because,&quot; he answered, &quot;I can't think of anything else to do.&quot; That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after &quot;The Dead&quot;, felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have a BS in English from Ga Tech in the USA.

In high school I purchased the volume because that is what readers did. Purchasing the book, however, is about all the good I got out of it back then. I don't think I even made it into Part II without giving up. So, naturally, a book likeJames Joyce's Ulysses: A Studyprofited my younger self infinitely more so than the novel it purported to study. That is because, without even having read the book, I could speak somewhat intelligently on the novel and also make ridiculously absurd remarks about its place in the \\"modernist project.\\" As you can imagine, I was invited to a lot of parties.Years passed, a Modern Library list of the one hundred greatest books of the twentieth century was issued, and Ulysses remained unread on my bookshelf. During my undergraduate studies, and I use the term \\"studies\\" in its most liberal application, I enrolled in a James Joyce course. I read it and I hated it. Now, in an attempt to read through the Modern Library's list, I have read it again. I am still convinced that it is not a great book.Ulysses is not a great book for many different reasons. First is its notorious and intentional difficulty. Joyce himself once commented on the book that he had \\"put so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.\\" And this is the problem. Joyce has forced so much meaning into the text so as to render it meaningless. Indeed, reading Ulysses is more academic exercise than pleasurable literary experience. Literature, at its core, is an attempt at human communication and what we have here is a failure to communicate. Few average readers are willing or able to invest the time and effort necessary to read and understand a novel whose explicit goal it is to confuse professional scholars.The difficulty of the book extends beyond the themes, symbols, and structure and into the very language employed to tell the story. If only Joyce had adopted - as Biddy the Clip describes Stephen Dedalus' language in the Circe chapter - a \\"marked refinement of phraseology,\\" then perhaps the novel wouldn't be so bad. Instead the book is strewn about with an infuriating amount of useless and obscure language. This opacity has spawned a cottage industry of explanatory texts. But this is a novel, not an excursion into unknown territory. We shouldn't need maps. In the end the language of Ulysses will limit it to a very select readership, namely those interested in convincing others of their sophistication and intellectual powers (you know, people like me). It will never enjoy popular readership. I am reminded here of the quaker librarian's warning from the Scylla and Charybdis chapter where he comments that, \\"the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\\"I offer that the book fails in two more respects. First, it fails in its stylistic ambitions. The book is perhaps best known for its stream-of-consciousness innovations. This narrative technique is an effort to get inside the head of the characters and to replicate the character's thoughts. For the most part, Joyce fails miserably at this. No one thinks like the characters of Ulysses think. Their thoughts are simply too sporadic, befogged, and preposterously plentiful. These passages may very well be streams-of-unconsciousness, but no one ever had a conscious thought pattern as absurd as those found in Ulysses. The interior monologues of Stephen Dedalus are the worst. Most readers, I imagine, skip them entirely. Readers interested in a proper execution of the stream-of-consciousness technique need look no further than William Faulkner or Virginia Woolf.Secondly, the novel fails in its modernism. If the modern novel is meant to serve as a symbolic manifestation of the confusion and aggravation of modern life, then the book is a wild success. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more confusing and aggravating than reading Ulysses is readingFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin). If, on the other hand, we understand the project of literary modernism to be an articulation of the era's spiritual disillusionment, despair and alienation then we need look no further than the prose of Ernest Hemingway.There is a way to read Ulysses. Read it slowly. This works in two respects. First, part of the charm of the novel, if there is any, is its language. By reading slow you will be able to digest it all. Secondly, if you are polymath and polyglot enough to understand what is going on, you will not miss anything important. Finally, as my undergraduate professor suggested, it helps to recite the book in your mind with a deep Dublin Irish accent. Doing so makes the book at a least a little more entertaining.So why would I offer suggestions about how to read the book if I feel that it's not worth reading? Well, my limited appreciation of the novel is based on its at times brilliant wordplay, its humor and the beauty of the final chapter.Few books provoke authentic LOLs. Ulysses is one of them. The first glimpse of this humor comes from the Hades chapter when Leopold Bloom - the alienated Jew trapped on an island of rabidly anti-Semitic Irish Catholics - ponders the curious rituals of the Roman faith as he and his peers lay to rest poor Paddy Dignam. Mr. Bloom satirizes the ritual prayers over the dead body with his own intonation of, \\"hoping you're well and not in hell.\\" In terms of the book's funny punnery, none is as enjoyable as that found in the conversation between Alf and Joe during the Cyclops chapter when Alf asks who has been making character assassinating allegations against Bloom. Joe replies, \\"I am the alligator.\\" Stephen Dedalus provides the biggest gut buster when, drunk and conversing, he professes that his understanding of brotherly love is reducible to the maxim that, \\"greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\\" Unfortunately, finding such humorous literary gems in Ulysses is like searching for a needle in a pile of donkey poo.Despite my previous distaste for the majority of the novel's language, there are some very pretty sentences in Ulysses. For instance, the shade of a tree becomes \\"the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves.\\" On a morning trip to the butcher, Leopold Bloom, relisher of the inner organs of beasts and fowls, watches as \\"the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.\\" Finally, instead of entering the carriage, a character pokes his \\"silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seats himself.\\"Finally, Ulysses endeared itself to me a bit more this time because the final episode, the Penelope chapter, is just so wonderful. This chapter documents the thoughts of a woman - Molly Bloom, wife of Leopold - as she falls asleep. Where elsewhere Joyce fails in composing a convincing stream-of-consciousness, here he is resoundingly successful. Molly Bloom's lazy, floating thoughts fall upon memories of her friends, her lovers (premarital and adulterous), her childhood, her dead son, her living daughter, her desire to blow Stephen Dedalus before finally and beautifully coming to rest upon (yes) her husband who has literally just kissed her ass. I realize that the prospect of reading a ponderous forty page run-on sentence may not sound like the most palatable literary endeavor. If there is anything that makes Ulysses worth reading, however, it is this chapter.Should you read Ulysses? I don't know. On one hand, it's the greatest novel ever written. Then again, it's certainly one of the worst. If anything, please do not read it on the Kindle. Get a print version. That way you can look really smart when people see you reading it on the subway."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, this book is staggeringly difficult. Yes, Joyce was a pompous, self-absorbed, pretentious butthead. Yes, he was a cynic who indulged in bitter ironies. But at the same time Joyce was also a senitmentalist and an idealist, and this magnificient novel is a successful exercise in unadulterated nostalgia. It is humble. It is funny. It is sad. It is vexing. And it contains the most sublime sentences and passages written in the English language: \\"On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.\\" The \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" chapter alone is both dazzling and haunting.

It is impossible to explain Ulysses or give it an adequate review in the short space alloted this reviewer. Howwver, I would offer the following thoughts for those brave souls eager to enter the labyrinthal complexities of a genius's mind:Joyce tells the story of one day in the life of the people of Dublin, Ireland on June 16, 1904 (the day he first met his wife Nora Baracle). As he does so in eighteen chapters linked with similar episodes in \\"The Odyssey.\\" During the day (about 900 pages) we follow the two chief characters on their peregrinations and adventures. Those characters are:Stephen Dedalus-Named for the Greek mytholgical figure Dedalus who builds wings to fly in the sky; his son Icarus flies too close to the sun and perishes while Dedalus lands in Sicily. Stephen was the chief character in Joyce's \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" He is tormented by his failure to pray at his dying mother's bedside; tormented by the Roman Catholic Church's burden of guilt laid upon his soul. Stephen is an aspiring author. He is ambivalent in his feelings toward his native Ireland. As the novel begins he is living in the English built castleThe Martello Tower along with his friend Buck Mulligan and an Englishman named Haines. Stephen is a teacher who is supervised by the horrible Deasy a West Englishman who in an Orange Protestant. Deasy is a false Nestor to the callow Stephen. Stephen is an intellectual with biographical correspondence to the author James Joyce.Leopold Bloom-A 38 year old advertising man who is married to the sensuous Molly. Bloom is a middlebrow who roams the streets of Dublin plying his advertising career engaging in arguments, dreaming about a sexy young thing on the beach and saving Stephen from trouble in the famous Nighttime section of the book. Leopold does not practice his Judaism. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. The novel ends with Bloom returning home to his unfaithful wife Molly just as Odysseus returned home to his faithful wife Penelope in the Homeric epic. Bloomsday is celebrated worldwide on Feb. 2 each year (the date of Joyce's birth in 1882).c. Molly Bloom-Her nearly fifty pages of stream of consciousness prose was until recently the longest sentence in the English language. She is a coarse, bawdy, serially cheating wife to Bloom.I do not claim to understand everything going on in Ulysses. Joyce said it would take the professors and critics centuries to explore its rich minefield of literary allusions, jokes, and analysis of the human condition. Ulysses has been banned and blasted by literary critics as the same time it has been praised. You may find out yourself by giving it a close reading with a good commentary handy. Joyce plums the depths of the human mind. He is a great Irish genius whose work demands study."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The best edition of what's considered by many the apotheosis of English fiction. As mentioned in the front matter, \\"this book reproduces, as closely as offset printing will allow, Roger Lathbury's copy of the first edition of Ulysses published by Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company in Paris in 1922. Broken type, signature numbers, and the colophon have been left as printed.\\" Editorial slip-ups are therefore obviously included, adding a quaint historical nuance.The perfect gift for any fan of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, this edition is elegant, a pleasure to hold and read, and ideal for anyone new to and wishing to appreciate Ulysses.

One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and now Ulysses. One apparent source of the joy of reading these for me is that all of the characters are good, sympathetic people, even when they do petty things. It is a world full of light and air, humor and optimism. Stephen Dedalus, Buck Mulligan, Leopold and Molly Bloom and all the rest are more-or-less normal humans living normal lives even though somewhat oppressed by poverty, the Church, and the English, and of course themselves. Ulysses has none of the violence, darkness, ugliness, cynicism, villiany, and perversion that is found in so much of modern literature. The most dramatic and upsetting thing that happens is when Stephen gets his hand whacked in school (in Portrait). Even Stephen's alchoholic irresponsible father is painted somewhat empathetically.The events in Ulysses are so prosaic and quotidian that Joyce had to dress up his work with high-fallutin prose and verbal pyrotechnics. Otherwise the work would just be too bland. The reader can skate over most of the obscure rambling parts or go back and endlessly ponder them. I ignore most of the references, and I'm not too taken with the Homeric and Biblical symbolism. The book can be read on many different levels. I admit I loved it--but I would recommend reading Dubliners and Portrait first. I would also recommend visiting Dublin if you can swing it, and especially Howth, which figures prominently in Ulysses. Howth is a charming village and vast, dramatic, wild, high headland with sweeping views of the Irish Sea, Bailey Lighthouse way below, and Dublin city center in the distance--all within the city limits of Dublin. Last stop north on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, they way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why haven't you read this book? There are two types of people in the world: those who love _Ulysses_ and those who despise it. It always astonishes me the degree to which some people loathe this book. One of my very best friends cannot read past an early description of the sea as \\"snot-green.\\" Go figure. Joyce challeneges our notions about the ordinary. The ordinary is not always beautiful. It is not always remarkable. But seen through the life of one ordinary man, a single day is an epic, albeit an ordinary one. And what's so wrong with that?Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedelus are perhaps the most intriguing characters in 20th Century art. They are opposites of a sort. Bloom is an everyman, Daedelus wants to be the Ubermensch, but he is far too Gallic. Bloom (the Hungarian Jew - anything but Gallic) triumphs in his epic, this day in Dublin. Stephen, well, he doesn't quite triumph. There are lessons here that one can explore for eons. Why is Bloom successful in his odyssey? Why isn't Stephen? Stephen is trapped in emerging Gallic existentialism, dark, \\"sinister\\" as Buck Mulligan describes it. Bloom is, well...Bloom. He is the good kind of existential...the Teutonic rather than Gallic.Read this book, for God's sakes. Don't take my word for it. Love it, hate it, I don't care.

He did everything so well he only had to each thing once. One short story collection: Dubliners. And one great novel: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. On the basis of these two works alone Joyce would be legend. But he did not stop there, he went further than anyone had ever gone with literature and wrote a new kind of novel, Ulysses. And after that another new kind of novel, Finnegans Wake. Ulysses is a work which every reader must face once in his life. Or twice. No other novel so sums up the reason novels are written. Ulysses is an epoch about culture but told lyrically through two characters, the familiar Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. Both will win you over. Dedalus for his scholars apprenticeship at life, and Bloom for his well versed walk through the very reaches of modern life. Irish this is in the very best sense. The language is real but the words are not coming from everyday talk but from the inside, the waking consciousness' dialogue with itself. That is the magic of this book. It is completely original born from nothing but inspiration. It is a great move to have Stephen, the character from his last novel, collide with Bloom, this new novels creation. Joyce has the teachers good will to introduce you to the new work via an old companion, brilliant stroke. The modern world really makes no sense is Stephens Tragedy and Blooms comedy. If you are a young man you will probably share Stephen's sentiments and if you are beyond youth you will share Bloom's. Or both which makes it all the more wonderful. No book is more insightful in leading to an understanding of the western predicament and no book has yet come close. Joyce writes in a sometimes hard to decipher prose but it is all worth it. In the end you will feel you have collided with the one who understood first what it was to be a modern life. Make it easy on yourself and read this after Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young man. For the best readers there is no other way. As for Finnegans Wake, I am still preparing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses can be a tough read, but is very rewarding for those who plough through it. James Joyce writes, in this book in particular, in what I would call the literary equivalent of the impressionist style of painting. By this I mean he sometimes he uses words as if they're broad brush strokes meant to give you an impression of the events taking place as opposed to describing them in a literal sense. Once you get the hang of his writing style the book really takes off, describing, in a surreal way, the world that the main character lives in. There were some portions of the book where I was lost and didn't know what was going on, but I persevered and this ended up being a good read.If you're ready for a challenge, pick this up. If you're just looking for some casual reading you might want to find something more straightforward."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Read it a long time ago, bult now I love having at hand, wherever I go, it takes a lifetime to really appreciate this classic"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Overall, better written than Portrait of an Artist, but nowhere near as entertaining. Basically, consider this as a brilliantly conceived book but with the most wholly unimaginative of plots. It's as intelligent as anything produced since Shakespeare, in other words -- but without all the life-giving drama. What it is is magnificent, in my opinion; but what it contains is insipid. Few people will actually enjoy reading this book, although it does have its moments. But mostly it's an impressive tower that in reality contains nothing much of importance. The most amazing construction possible in the center of which resides a pot of total rot.The narrative mainly follows two protagonists: Stephen Dedalus (from Portrait of the Artist, loosely based on Joyce himself) and \\"Leopold Bloom,\\" presented as Stephen's somewhat more reasonable counterpart, as they meander throughout the course of a single day in Dublin, Ireland, shortly after the first World War, although that fact has almost no bearing on the story.The \\"plot\\" (which is also much beside the point) centers around death: the recent death of Stephen's mother and the not-so-recent death of Bloom's infant son, Rudy. In the end, the two personalities come together in Bloom's home and a kind of a reconciliation is formed -- but again, this is all beside the point.The book appears to be James Joyce's attempt to completely reconstruct what the novelistic form can accomplish, and it reads as such. Terribly thin on plot, but thick on construction, like a house whose rooms are empty. The writing is interesting, particularly to individuals interested in the art of writing -- but the story of the day is quite simply boring as hell.The few good moments include Stephen's theories about what many consider to be Shakespeare's finest play -- Hamlet -- and Bloom's somewhat psycho-sexual encounter with a young girl later on in the evening.Distasteful passages frequently occur, where Joyce appears to take great pains toportray man as a whole as a sick, sadistic, filthy, and secretive animal; again, not really a joy to read through.The real problem here is story, not form. The form is magnificent. It can't be improved upon. But where is the story? What is particularly interesting here? That ultimately Stephen and Bloom forge a kind of friendship? That ultimately provided meaning, but I did not care. Will you?Portrait of the Artist has a developing character changing over time; Ulysses just has a single day, no matter how well written about it is.

Robert Gogan has treated the original with all the respect it deserves and by placing the speech in quotes, thoughts in italics and story in normal print, has made the reading a much easier endeavour than my previous attempts.So I finished the book....Now to read it again!Thank you for making Ulysses an achievable task. I am very content!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple of months ago I wrote a review (below) of a very specific edition of Ulysses (the Modern Library hardcover version) complaining that the relevant Amazon page contained descriptive material misidentifying which version of the text the book contained (an important matter in this case, as anyone familiar with the Ulysses Wars will recognize!). Now I realize that the problem with Amazon's description of books with multiple editions (like Ulysses) goes far deeper than I initially realized, as my review seems to have been attached by Amazon to all sorts of different versions of Ulysses, rather than just the page for the specific edition I had set out to review. In fact, you really cannot tell from the Amazon page for a book like Ulysses which version is being discussed. So, be warned that Amazon's modus operandi can create sheer confusion for works that are published in multiple (varying) editions!My original review of Modern Library edition:Amazon's current webpage description creates the misleading impression that this (Modern Library hardcover) is the text as \\"corrected' by Gabler in the 1980s. However, the cover of the book seems to be clear that this is in fact the 1961 verson of the text. Gabler's edition has some supporters but also some vehement critics. I would just suggest that those planning to invest in a copy of the book take at least a brief look at accounts of the controversy to decide which edition they might prefer. In any case, let's at least try to be clear about which is which!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a struggle.

The way the novel goes back and forth between joyce reality and the stream of thoughts are simply increable. Increable in both how he conviced it and who effect it is. There are also just prse of pure emtion that anyone can instanitly understand . As for the charaters, all are intresting and distinct. Each word has to be read very carefully to understand what is happening but the end resut is both and intresting and intensen novel.Any one who truly enjoys ulysses should also check out Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Doblin, which is also a large urban story useing the stream of concessness"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Strange as it may seem, many people do read and re-read this novel simply because they love it!It would be impossible to summarize a work such as this in a few lines, but what I love most about this work is its humanity. Joyce is not satirizing Homer: in invoking \\"The Odyssey\\", he is not so much deflating the heroic as elevating the everyday. The mundane day-to-day events which constitute life for the vast majority of us are given a heroic dimension - and, indeed, why should they not? A good, decent man like Bloom is as worthy of praise as was Ulysses.This is one of the great affirmative novels in a century where literature has, by and large, been dominated by darkness."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One cannot stress the importance of Ulysses. As a book, it almost defies explanation, such is it's achievement, in that it seems to be a story a story of so very little, yet with the importance of Odyssean epic. It's hard to explain. The thing about Ulysses is that it's sheer inventiveness will capture you. Joyce not only places you in the scene via description, the very words he uses become the description themselves, in the shape and texture of them. The book is also a library of allusions, but they can be taken as they are, or decoded within the book itself. There has never been a book quite like it before or since, and it is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century's malaise. It addresses not only the development of Ireland, but the development of man, and predicts the trends of the next hundred years effectively."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"it is hard to imagine exactly what i think of this except for the fact that maybe precisely once more you forget but forget no forgivance that once around is more for twice but you grow with twice"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I must say, Ulysses is perhaps the most difficult to understand book ever written (aside from Finnegan's wake) yet it is pure genius. I decided to read it as my independent book for a highschool english course. I stumbled through it, with lots of assistance from my teacher and found it to be the most rewarding literary experience. Joyce's characters are so complex and three dimensional that one can hardly believe they are not actual humans. It is the most enlightening experience to feel that you are in someone else's mind. Although this book is very challenging, it is something every person should experience before they die. Make a point to read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Ulysses, as well as dissecting it's labrynthe and numerous metaphorical qualities, far too many to go into in a maximum of a thousand words, I can say with all confidence and utmost rightousness that Joyces masterpiece belongs in the league of reverence given to Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. It is without a doubt the single most awesome display of genius in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough! To those unmanned by the maze: you are not stupid by default if you despise every scrabble Joyce scribbled. Many intelligent people, including Virginia Woolf, saw nothing in Ulysses and less in the Wake. To others Ulysses is the liveliest and funniest book ever. To the academics who comb Ulysses--agile horse--for the nits of criticism (thereby insuring Joyce's immoraltality), please leave alone we who would enjoy without inheriting the immense debtorship of things better left undone. To those who would deny that Ulysses is the most important (not necessarily the best) novel ever written, the very fact that so many are compelled to constantly trash it is the ultimate tribute to its place. Finally, let it be known that Joyce swore on Ulysses, on the honor of a gentleman, which admittedly he was not: --There is not one serious word in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only two things that matter in any type of writing are What Is Written (Substance) and How It Is Written (Style). Ulysses is an amazing book when it comes to style. I can not think of a book that compares; in fact, Ulysses is many books, with each chapter written in a style that is best suited for it. I first read Ulysses when I was in graduate school, and was simply blown away by the sheer breadth and depth of Joyce's writing ability. The book influenced me dramatically: it freed me from the chains of accepted modes of written expression. I love the last chapter: not a SINGLE mark of punctuation. Maybe that's nothing new but back in the beginning of the century it was Totally Radical! But with this said, the story itself is very boring, the philosophic allusions inpenetrable and the supposedly comic elements totally unfunny.But for its stylistic brilliance and Joyce's courage/genius, I give it 10 of 10."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce most of been a prankster.

After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \\"word overture.\\" At the beginning of the \\"Siren section,\\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \\"genius.\\" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly a great book, and not just my opinion. Having been born in Dublin, lived there for 25+ years, I knew the city well. The speech sounds and vocabulary are so familiar and recall specially my father, who knew 'Buck Mulligan' very well.Apart from this, the writing and the structure are amazing. If a reader does not really know Ireland, some work of commentary would be a wise accompaniment. Otherwise one can miss a great deal of the implications and innuendos, and, in particular, some of the classic Irish humor."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Purchased\\" because I've never read it, and felt that at the age of 58, it was time.

What I can offer is the viewpoint of an 'average' reader.My edition was the 1922 text, and it was prefaced by the original publisher with a simple disclaimer: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances.\\" And it certainly is understandable and necessary: the text is rife with punctuation, spelling and word issues - but it is nearly impossible to tell which are deliberate and which came courtesy of the type setter.The structure itself is almost more of a literary experiment than a novel. It switches presentations, from interior monologue to grandiose play to question and answers to stream of consciousness. At least that happens in sections, so the reader has some chance of keeping within the structure presented.I read that Joyce wanted someone to be able to recreate Dublin from the text of this book - that's probably a good way to describe the essence of it. While not every street is named, the character of the city through its inhabitants comes through (often more clearly than what the event does that he is writing about).It was a struggle to get through this book on my own, and I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it if read as part of a class or discussion group, particularly if there were participants with knowledge of Irish history and specifically Joyce's background. The failings however are more my own versus the text itself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm not sure if I would have been able to get into this book so much if I hadn't been taught by an amazing Joyce scholar in a Ulysses seminar, but please, buy a couple of Ulysses supplements if you are unable to take an accompanying class.

Poor or non-existent headings combine with frequent appearances of \\"?\\" in place of various letters to make this a frustrating read. Fortunately, I read the Modern Library edition years ago and was able to muddle through. Definitely not recommended for first time readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Pretty amazing, but such a bloody ordeal at times that it's hard to justify the time and effort required. How many other great books could you read in the time it takes to get thru Ulysses (assuming a serious effort)? It's a huge chunk of your reading life. Still glad I got thru it and can now enjoy some familiarity with one of the legendary works of western fiction.I do think Joyce went overboard structurally. Some of the episodes struck me as too cryptic and obscure in their form, their structural basis too removed from anyything meaningful for me. Such a large portion of the book is entirely unconventional in form and it's so overwhelming and confusing. Of course, there is some spectacular writing, and a ton of great wit and laughs. And some of the stream of consciousness and interior monologue sections are so remarkable and compelling that you just have to read it.Some advise no reference materials on first reading. I disagree and say get the Gifford encyclopedia and try to use it only when needed and to try to resist looking up every reference, allusion, slang or colloquialism, etc. I also used SparkNotes just for basic episode summaries. A good dictionary is essential. Helps to have read The Odyssey (obviously), Hamlet, Portrait of the Artist, Dubliners, the Bible, and more.Man what a beast..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The typefaces and the size of the book are exquisitely reproduced and the design is impressively pleasurable for reading. The only shame is that the cover has been made with a paperback print that does not coincide with (although one cannot say it does not look good) the idea of reproducing a first edition. Nonetheless, this is the most beautiful edition of Ulysses one can acquire in the mass market today."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Hello from this particular corner of the abstract retail market.What a delight to have Amazon recommend the novel I've made practically a point in life to get around to reading! It provided just the necessary final incentive needed to throw all the \\"wait 'til a good time\\" aside and actually just read it, which of course is ultimately how it needs to be read.\\"Ulysses\\" is famous for being \\"impenetrable\\" and \\"unreadable\\", but is far from either. Just like other formal experiments in writing, like Beat era writing, Thomas Pynchon novels, and more recently novels by such authors as David Foster Wallace (may he rest in peace) and Mark Z. Danielewsky, it's not a matter so much of understanding everything and getting the plot as it is of letting the book take you along on its own terms. In the case of \\"Ulysses\\" specifically, each chapter is it's own new formal experiment, and it is of my humble opinion that you are allowed to like some parts better than others. Those who have a problem with it are those who go into the reading with their own expectations or demands informing their analysis. \\"Ulysses\\" is an experience, and one that I think most people should at least try to have to see if it's for them or not (just like skydiving or eating unfamiliar food in a foreign country).And like most media, the things that make it controversial are quite often beyond the point, and anybody who actually read the text finds that out quickly. This novel is about a lot of things, love, language, intertextuality, Shakespeare, Greek myth, Dublin (it does, after all, fall between the proto-neorealistic writing of \\"Dubliners\\" and the intense brooding of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\"), humour, and life, and there are other repeated themes, allusions, motifs, and forms to give any critical reader much to play with and brood over, but it certainly is not difficult reading and it definitely isn't smut. Go figure.In conclusion, this was a great way to start actually following Amazon's recommendation system, and I'm very proud of myself for finally getting around to doing something I really wanted to do after putting it off needlessly for so long.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many others have written in more words than I care to think about concerning the tremendous effort that it takes to read Ulysses, the worth of this expenditure of your time, and of their almost universal admiration for it. There are a few detractors to be sure and Joyce would be ecstatic that his artfulness has indeed led to his \\"immortality\\" since he is quoted as saying as much.I wish to add what seems to be left out almost universally in the many reviews and recommendations. Everywhere you are told to accompany Ulysses by annotations, discussion/interpretation books but almost nowhere are you told to accompany Ulysses by the words Joyce wrote himself. One of the protagonists, Stephen Dedalus, as well as his father Simon, are not first introduced to us in Ulysses. They are introduced in great detail in \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\". Simon's fall from prosperity to poverty and the impact it has on Stephen/Joyce is crucial background. Understanding that \\"A Portrait ...\\" is autobiographical in nature, reveals much about both Joyce and the characters. You are better prepared to meet Stephen with his superior intellect, education, and his feeling of separation from his countrymen and his behavior if you first read \\"A Portrait ...\\".Many of the characters in Ulysses are introduced to us first in the collection of short stories \\"Dubliners\\". Easily two dozen characters from the Ulysses, some mentioned only in passing, are much better developed in short stories in Dubliners.The milieu of Ulysses, as well as the many characters (all meanings intended) Bloom and Dedalus interact with in their meanderings, are better taken in with these two wonderful works helping to embolden you to tackle Ulysses. Both of them are wonderfully approachable, easily read, and are extremely entertaining, full of the wit and wisdom of Joyce. You are certainly more intimately involved with the evolution of Joyce as he proceeds towards Ulysses with these arrows in your quiver.The structure and basic timeline of the book are dictated by Homer's Odyssey. It is certainly easier to understand why Stephen is Telemachus, Bloom is Odysseus, and Molly is Penelope if you have actually read the Odyssey!The reviewer goes to Symphony Space on Broadway almost every year for Bloomsday (June 16). Find a similar event near you. Ulysses is a monster \\"play\\". It is meant to be enjoyed with others and is much more accessible when experienced aloud. Take the time to understand why people believe this to be the best novel of the 20th century. It will be my favorite forever I am sure.Lastly, I do not recommend Gabler. It is clearly marked by Amazon and other booksellers as by Joyce and Gabler. Be forewarned that there is much scholarship which seriously detracts from Gabler's additions, subtractions, and modifications as not intended by Joyce. That said, I am absolutely certain that Joyce would have enjoyed the controversy tremendously. Read Ulysses in whatever form you can get it but prepare yourself first with the words and experiences Joyce wanted you to have first."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't think its helpful to read Ulysses as a novel. If you expect a plot, or a tale or character arcs, or realism, or accessible prose, you will be frustrated. Would you read the Bible with those expectations? Or the Odyssey? And those books along with Hamlet are touchstones for Ulysses but also the caliber of the company Joyce's great book keeps. So how is Ulysses a novel? It has characters that we follow and whose psychology is revealed to us. It uses narrative to move along story elements through the eighteen episodes (though clearly not chapters so more evidence of it not being a novel). There is Bloom's letter to Martha, Boylan's date with Molly and Stephen's homeless fate. Ulysses uses the novel to both explode that form and to honor it as an artistic expression. This aspect of the book; its subverted novelistic qualities is what gives Ulysses its forbidding reputation as unreadable or as pointlessly obscure.The pleasure in reading Ulysses is not novelistic, it is humanistic, it is to ruminate on the existence of Western Civilization. It is to experience connections to our mythic past and our primal present. It is to ponder where our flawed, suffering, imaginative, humanity will take us as we move through the century beyond the Joyce's creation. More than that it's a chance to contemplate our own capacity for contradiction, ambiguity, creativity, perversity, cleverness and fantasy.Joyce isn't just showing off his genius. He is displaying the full range of it so that we can participate in it and take of it what we can, if we can and be not afraid of not making sense. There are deeper truths than simple comprehension and Joyce tantalizes us with glimpses of what they could be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Vintage Classics is a great version to get because it includes the Supreme Court ruling from Judge Woolsey lifting the ban on \\"Ulysses\\" which allowed it back into the United States. Besides, it also contains the corrected text.It's true that this book revolutionized and refined stream-of-conciousness and it's almost too easy to get caught up on that fact. Really, though, Joyce is doing nothing more in his writing than what people do every day in their lives. When I first started reading this book I re-read over passages but later realized it was better to go on, to follow the certain thought process the character had, just to help realize how complex and subtle some things really were. The book is dense but mimicks how a person thinks and feels within the context of every day life. With that said, the plot is only there as something running in the background so that there can be various thoughts provoked by the action. What makes it a difficult read (this is what the writer of preface to \\"Finnegans Wake\\" said as well) is the readers wanting to piece things together systematically so that it makes sense. Have you ever been having a discussion or been walking down the street when something random seems to remind you of something else completely unrelated? Often times a path may be traced to how or why something reminded you of something else and the same goes with this book. But I think the hardest part is accepting that everything fits together even though we don't understand it.As others have said, the last chapter is worth reading the book alone. The inward struggle Molly has with herself, along with her reconciliation at the end, is absolutely wonderful. Without the initial 740 (!) pages written in his difficult style I don't think I would have gotten as much out of this final chapter. I have to say, I was literally breathing heavily after I read this and felt as though I were feeling exactly as Molly. It's certainly a lot of pages to wade through but worth every minute and gives perfect reason for enjoying a second reading.This is by far the most enjoyable and rewarding book I've ever read. When I put it down I thought to myself, \\"What the hell just happened?!\\" and I wish every book could do the same."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems Ulysses touches on every theme experienced in human life. But it doesn't dwell on any of these subjects (or literary style) for long enough to pass judgement.Bloom is criticized for being a jew, but his critics are drunken commoners who are also simultaneously ridiculed and praised. Stephen mourns for his mother but dislikes and avoids his father. Bloom's wife truly loves her husband but she cheats on him.This novel is purposely vague because there are several ways of looking at any one thing and Joyce demonstrates this truth in the various narrators. Almost every character and line of dialogue is considered and reconsidered through the minds of the characters or other unnamed narrators. Joyce is telling us there is no one truth accesible to everyone, all we can do is appreciate the endlessly interactive and timeless quality of an ordinary day and strive to love our enemies."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"OK. It doesn't take a genius to realize that unless you're name is James Joyce you're not going to fully understand this book. There are too many obscure allusions and not even the very well read will get it all. So here's how I tackled the book. Skip the allusions. Yes, skip them. There's no point trying to figure them out because you won't. Just read the narrative, follow the story, trace the themes, and 'try' to appreciate Joyce's style. Then, if you really like the book that much go back and re-read it, only this time use one of the 'guides' to Ulysses that are out there to figure out the allusions.If you approach the book this way it become much easier to read. You'll still get the story, the structure, and the enough of the style."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jorge Luis Borges once thanked Joyce and Picasso in the introduction of one of his books. It was a joke. Borges obviously felt both names had been evoked so many times as to make the mere mention of either of them seem ponderous. I kind of agree with that assessment.Joyce certainly has received top billing by the academy and if your impression of him is, well, reverent, you are in good company. I read Ulysses first because I wanted to know this huge book which everyone talked about with such admiration and then I read it again in college in a Joyce seminar. I have to say the seminar was enjoyable but not altogether because of the author chosen. I think we students and teacher felt like we were conquering a mountain and were proud of ourselves every step of the way. In memory the actual book does not loom very large in the way other great works do nor do I feel much affection for it. The characters and plot are implanted in my brain but rarely do they move about nor do scenes get replayed in my imagination. Perhaps Joyce's work was so complete that it didn't leave much room for any other imagination to go to work on it so Ulysses never became one of my favorites. I don't suppose I can wholeheartedly recommend the book given my less than enthusiastic feeling about it. In fact I think I learned a lot more from other books by less revered authors. Joyce had talent to spare but I think for me he just loads Ulysses with too many apparently ordinary though symbolic so very literary things and the result is that I am not inspired by his art but rather put off by the excessive weight and meaning the work aquires as one works ones way through. So much has been said about the work that it almost comes to the reader with a feeling of having been pre-interpreted for you. Joyce I think contributes to this reaction because he left little room for &quot;interpretations&quot; of his work, its all layed out for you and there really is no latitude for an individual encounter with it. You either submit to its spell or you don't. Perhaps the net result is that in this case more turns out to be less. It can't be penalized for being too much of a good thing so five stars despite all just said.Some have mentioned that this book benefits from being read out loud. Perhaps that is the Catholic interpretation of this very Catholic author. Ulysses as incantation. That approach does have its advantages with this book. There is available a recording of Joyce himself reading excerpts from Ulysses and Finnegans Wake(Anna Plurabelle). I've heard it and it is like hearing a fairy tale written by the unconscious for adults. His voice is musical and he reads like he is summoning the spirit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim gets a little carried away like Pacino chewing carpets.

I listen to it repeatedly and constantly, and meanings emerge very gratifyingly. JOyce is to be heard rather than seen (the ineluctable modality of the visible), and often and forever. As for the the Dubliner stories, again pass by Norton and go for Setlock on Commuter's Library audiobooks. UNfortunately is still only on tape, but the subtley of his tempered readings bear repeated and gratifying listening. Save Norton for the stage.

All the bits of doggerel and poetry that are in the text seem to be missing. I made it through 16% of the free edition, and just felt like something was not right. Not having a hard copy where I am, I checked out another Kindle edition that costs about $3.00. It in fact feels complete, at least so far. The poetry is in there, which really adds to the text. An example of what is missing: early in the book Stephen Dedalus is talking to his class, and they ask for a riddle. He gives them a riddle, which is missing in the free text. The ANSWER to the riddle is there, but the riddle itself is missing. Now some have argued here that this type of text is not necessarily integral to the book. However, let's be blunt. You are preparing to tackle one of the most challenging books in the English language. Don't you want the whole thing? To do less is to not do justice to your efforts as a reader.Unlike some here, I don't disparage Amazon's efforts to put these free books out there. I have read several on an extended tour outside the country, where my kindle is my constant companion, filled largely with free books. Some have had typos, some have had formatting issues. The common denominator is that they have all been free. BUT, to read Tarzan of the Apes for free, with some typos, is one thing; to tackle Ulysses without the benefit of the full text seems somewhat pointless, particularly when there is a low cost text available on Amazon which appears to be complete. One last note, though. The edition I am mentioning here is the Unabridged and Illustrated. When it first showed up on Amazon it said Unabridged (annotated). There were no annotations, and I have yet to see any illustrations. Still, this is the text you want, not the free version here.Update: Amazon keeps changing the name of this more complete edition. It is now listed as Ulysses (Annotated Edition) for $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I suppose I shouldn't complain much at 95 cents, but the text has a disconcertingly high error rate.

Maybe it is, but I know there are more than a few of us who found this book to be a thrilling adventure without quite knowing why. On the surface, it appears to be the story of 18 uneventful hours in the lives of two Dubliners. We see them snark, teach, defecate, work (half-heartedly), worry, lust, and drink. Exciting right? Yes.Admittedly, this book can be exciting only to a lover of language and literature. The book is subdivided into 18 sections, each roughly an hour. Each section acts as its own writing experiment, some more obvious than others. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not written in stream-of-consciousness. It employs this technique, as it employs many others. True, the last section of the book consists of a 40-page stream-of-consciousness sentence, but another section presents itself as a play where the stage directions help move the reader into the subconscious desires/fears of the characters. I doubt Joyce was ignorant of Freud. And I can't forget to mention that the layers of symbolism and metaphor are absolutely dazzlying.But if Ulysses was nothing more than a writing experiment, it would be dull even to the most erudite of readers. Its true strength lies in its surprising humanity. By poking at the heads of the two protagonists, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, Joyce offers up one of the most complete portraits of the human experience ever put into words. The sylistic experiments are not simply indulgent, but are woven into the fabric of this portrait.Everthing ties together in a phantasmagoric representation of the mundane, complete with a brilliant and frightening climax that seems to fuse every primal symbol of the universe into a single sentence....But I had help with this one. If I hadn't had the professor I had and a whole month to study the book, I may never have had the literary adventure I did. To anyone who wants to tackle this beast, I recomend picking up the EXCELLENT guide, The New Bloomsday Book: A Guide Through Ulysses, by Harry Blamires. I can't say enough about how accessible and thorough this guide is.

ULYSSES is a masterpiece of 20th Century literature. ULYSSES requires a deep knowledge of Western Civilization. ULYSSES is the expression of modern man's heroic quest for meaning in a world without heroes or meaning. ULYSSES has to be read along with a dozen other books on how to read ULYSSES.Much of this is true.But what is omitted by reviewers, time after time, is the warm humor, born of Joyce's compassion for people, that surfaces on every page. From the obvious riddles told to and by the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to the scholarly puns and tropes uttered by the narrators, ULYSSES can be seen as one great comic book. Listen closely to the words of the one-eyed Citizen in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; chapter. Pay attention to what the soldier screams just before he decks Stephen Dedalus. The dark humor surrounding Paddy Dignam's funeral is hysterical.No, this doesn't mean ULYSSES is light reading--don't bring it along on your trip to the beach or the ski lodge. The novel makes many demands on the reader, as do many of the other works we consider milestones of literature. This doesn't mean you have to read it in a dusty library and takes notes on every page. The book is filled with lightness and life. The fact that it ends with the word &quot;Yes&quot; is the most obvious expression of ULYSSES' life-affirming attitude.Certainly there are devestating moments that wrench your heart: Stephen's run-in with his pathetic father and Bloom's vision of the ghost of his son immediately come to mind. But for the most part, ULYSSES is a raunchy, rowdy, ride that makes the difficult parts easier to bear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself.

I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses does not throw out the welcome mat. Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \\"dramatic style\\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \\"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \\"reading\\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \\"Cyclops\\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \\"Nausicaa\\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \\"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.Mark Twain remarked \\"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \\"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses.(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an avid reader, I've often thought, &quot;Which book would I want to take with me to a desert island if I could only pick one book.&quot; Others like the Bible, or Dante's Inferno, or the Odyssey have crossed my mind, but in terms of revealing almost infinite possibilities, Ulysses is my pick, hands down. Recently I've reread some of it, but I read the book in a full in graduate school. For first time readers, my advice is, don't be intimidated! Unlike Finnegan's Wake which is not really &quot;readable&quot; by a normal person (okay, if you happen to be able to understand word puns in 27 different languages -- I don't mean to insult anyone...), I find that with some background preparation, Ulysses is very readable. As background, you should reread the Odyssey since each book is based on a corresponding book of the Odyssey. Then, you should get one or two guides to reading Ulysses (Gilbert has an easy to follow one) and try reading one chapter of Ulysses while keeping open the pages in the commentary (may remind some readers of biblical study). In fact, reading this book is the closest I think a non-rabbinical student will come to an exercise like reading Talmud (which comments on the Bible). The experience is infinitely rewarding and will teach you more about reading than any course you could take. The basic plot of the book is not at all hard to follow and there is an abundance of ribald humor. Lest you think Ulysses is &quot;upscale&quot; think again!Let me be clear: this is THE masterwork of the 20th century. It holds up well as one of the greatest of all time. No serious writer has escaped its influence. When you tackle it, you will understand what a great literary achievement is. After reading it for the first time, I become a Joyce fanatic. I'd also recommend both the Ellman biography of Joyce and the even better (in my opinion) biography of his wife Nora. You'll learn lots about Ulysses by reading both of these books as well. Don't be intimidated -- jump in head first. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book. Reading it takes more effort than most novels require, but every ounce of effort (snd sweat) is well worth it. If you ar e avoiding this book because of its difficulty, don't. It's attainable. If you are having problems I highly recommend buying a copy of the audio version and reading along with it. This is probably the only book for which I would recommend the audio edition, Ulysses was meant to be read aloud. Other usefull books to have handy are Gilbert's book and Gifford's book. Gilbert is the standard, basic interpretation of Ulysses, and Gifford's Annotated lets you in on all of the obscure references in the novel. Gifford elucidates references to other literature and the more obscure references to Irish &quot;current events&quot; and such. Finally, I would stay away from the Gabler edition of Ulysses. The general consensus is that for every 4 errors Gabler fixed, he introduced 6 more. The 1961 edition (published by Vintage) is more standard."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The book consists of an overabundance of mini-stories that are irrelevant to each other and there is no real plot.

If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is a book that must be held, not battery powered. I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes.

It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First off, let me say that I did not complete this book. One of my English teachers once told me that if a book did not capture your imagination within the first 50 pages, it would be wise to put the book down. Well, I gave this book 225 pages, and I thought that it was once of the most boring and esoteric books I have ever come across. I first read -A Portriat of the Artist as a Young Man-, which I thought was quite good. I came in with high hopes for -Ulysses-, but was very let down. I found myself not only getting lost with the pages and pages of thoughts Joyce presents us with, but also with some of the dialogue, when all the characters rample on about someone speaking Irish. I have no doubt that Joyce was a genious, his books are filled with game show like trivia. However, I think for a book to be considered a \\"Classic,\\" or, \\"one that should be read by everyone,\\" then that book should not have to be refered to as a \\"Project,\\" nor should it take people a year to read, as some of the other on-line reviewers have said it took them.

This can be terribly annoying if you are in an English / literature class and everyone has a different edition of the book. Someone says &quot;turn to page 37&quot;, and every page 37 is different.

The Gaelic Helen wants to project anthropo-graphs peculiar in egoistic units and Anglicized to a conservatory.The institution of the archival in culture consciousness wages the dialectic of the personal, in the context of \`Blakian excess and pyrrhic success'. The possibility of being logical is shifted on to the childish of being idiotic in satisfaction.The \`Pyrrhic' \`pier' becomes a Xantippe who resolves the logic as coming out with ease.

The major obscenity, which should never have been permitted by the USA legal system, the marketplace for literature, or the fawning academic community, was the publication of this duplicitous enigma. Many scholars have devoted their careers to explaining its content, but its raison d'tre and current status are still a complete mystery to me.Psychological Profiling: Joyce/BloomFrom \\"stately, plump\\" Buck Mulligan's entrance on the first page to Molly Bloom's memories of her first lover 20+ hours and 600+ pages later, the unifying constancy is: This is not a \\"reader-friendly\\" work. For example, check out Wikipedia's content descriptors for major sections:* (Episode 3, Proteus) \\"Stephen reminisces and ponders ... This chapter is characterized by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode.\\" [NB: When Stephen thinks or talks, it is often in Latin, French, or Italian - with no translation for the reader.]* (Episode 7, Aeolus) \\"This episode ... is characterized by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.\\"* (Episode 12, Cycolops) \\"This chapter is marked by extended tangents made outside the voice of the unnamed narrator: hyperboles of legal jargon, Biblical passages, Irish mythology, etc.\\"* (Episode 14, Oxen of the Sun) \\"This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which seems to recapitulate the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang.\\"* (Episode 15, Circe) \\"The plot is frequently interrupted by \`hallucinations' experienced by Stephen and Bloom - fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters.\\"* (Episode 16, Eumaeus) \\"The rambling and labored style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.)* (Episode 17, Ithaca) \\"The style is that of a scientific inquiry ... The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.\\"* Episode 18, Penelope) \\"The final episode ... also uses the stream of consciousness technique ... consists of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy: ... she recalls ... wishes ... imagines ... wonders ... senses ... fantasizes ... remembers ...\\"So what's the take-away from this painful experience? For me it was the state of James Joyce's mental health as he wrote Ulysses.ConsubstantialityHere I treat James Joyce and Leopold (Poly) Bloom as one. I will let Stephen Dedalus, a central character, make the argument for me. Early on Stephen makes the argument that Christ and God the Father are one:* \\"... the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father ... Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.\\" (p. 22)* \\"... the son consubstantial with the father. ... He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and Others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and the dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\\" (pp. 179-180)Having made the spiritual argument, Stephen then extrapolates to the relationship between Shakespeare (\\"After God Shakespeare has created most.\\" p. 193) and Hamlet contending that (a) Shakespeare begot Hamlet, and (b) Shakespeare and Hamlet are one.So here I accept the Joyce/Dedalus argument that the Father and Son are one and that Shakespeare and Hamlet are one and conclude that he is telling us that he and Bloom are one.Psychological Profile: Bloom/JoyceGiven the manner in which Ulysses is written, it is difficult to identify passages representing bona fide hallucinations. I do not accept the \\"fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters\\" (Wikipedia, Episode 15) as hallucinations primarily due to their transient nature. Bloom easily discards his hallucinatory behavior when Stephen is in need of protection, guidance, and mentoring. True hallucinations are not easily discarded when reality dictates the need for lucidity. Rather than hallucinations, Bloom's expressed fears and passions appear to be dream content. I suspect James Joyce kept a dream diary and used the material from it many places in Ulysses. I also suspect many of his dreams were in the form of nightmares, perhaps induced by excessive use of absinthe, a highly alcoholic beverage quite popular at the time.Let's use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) to label Bloom's behavior:* Primary Diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by recurrent pornographic sexual images, repeated doubts, the need to have things in a particular order, excessive counting, and word repetition.The entire book is a testimony to Bloom's OCD but two favorite examples come to mind here:* Bloom is asked by an unseen inquisitor what he admires about water. His extensive listing starts with its \\"universality\\" and ends with its \\"stagnant pools in the waning moon\\". (p. 528)* Later, he is asked to describe the content of two drawers which he goes through each evening seeking relaxation before attempting to go to sleep. The detailed listing (pp. 566-568) is apparently revisited each night before going to bed.He even presents a detailed list of men he believes have been his wife's lovers over the years and does so in the order in which she has been involved with them. (p. 575)And by his own declarations of consubstantiality, we have reason to think of Bloom and Joyce as one.In summary, if OCD is your thing, you will enjoy reading Ulysses over and over again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that I have thought about almost all my life.

Yes.Ok so I have review this,can I be consider as intellectual now?:-) J/K"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While Squire Taylor might have waxed excessively virulent, he does provide a valid point. I have long questioned Joyce's status as a great writer. Not that he failed to display a knack for the pen - indeed, his _Dubliners_ contains work of substantial depth and real stylistic artistry (particularly &quot;The Dead&quot;). My qualm is with his later works, especially the much-praised _Ulysses_. Here Joyce lapsed into experimentation for the sake of experimentation. The final result was a muddled mess, the underlying meaning of which can only be _constructed_ by general readers of exceptional creativity or professional critics with advanced degrees and an excess of spare time.And even if we give Joyce the benefit of the doubt, even if we believe that he was (like Thomas Wolfe, who had, after all, a very patient editor) writing to capture each and every moment of our lives, we must admit the difficulty of the task. Literature must follow some logical construct; it must sort our daily chaos with art. If we follow Joyce's example by stuffing a day's garbled thoughts into a book, we have created only a mirror - something that apes our futility. True literature, on the other hand, attacks our existence piecemeal. And though such literature may never reveal the meaning of each breath or cry &quot;fiat lux&quot; before God or the Void or whatever lies at the root of the universe, it is a symbol of our unquenchable willingness to kick against the pricks, to grasp at unknowable truth. The artist, in carefully crafting - in reaching for that elusive order and higher truth - breathes new and continual life into those words of William Faulkner:&quot;[Man] is immortal not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice . . . [must] help him endure and prevail.&quot;How can our &quot;puny inexhaustible voice&quot; ring defiantly when, like Joyce, we wallow in our daily morass?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am sure you will not find this worthwhile. I did buy the book sometime ago but did not realise it is so long and so confusing. There is lots of words but no real story line as I can see. I have read and heard people say that it is a classic of english literature, and I intend to wade through it on my Kindle.I have not given up, my daughter studied the book at university but she had to admit that it is hard to read and it was written in a drunken state. I intend to give it a good try to see the literary value and if it is worthy of the title. I will have to let you know later."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"harlequin! poseidon! here is a work that not only achieved more leaps in linguistic innovation at its time but also, the sun beaming in profuse shower, a wild reinvention of plot and a rugged onslaught against tradition. joyce uses this ancient tale of a man's homecoming so as to put the microscope on the human and analyze him and all his cohorts, his battalions and his industry! he studies mankind with a depth that no author before or since has achieved. he delves into the conscience, intermixes himself in its folds and strata, writes what he sees and leave us with a vast resource with which to consider, study and conjecture! but not only that - not just a study, also a baffling surprise of linguistic advance! each chapter is radically different from the previous! each chapter is coherent unto itself, set apart from the rest of the book, each chapter employs a different style, concerns a different subject, each chapter riots, blazes and fumes, each chapter is flash-jolt of mental sundance. as we read the book we watch joyce grow and develop as an artist since we know that he wrote the chapters in chronological order. the third chapter, proteus, his first endeavor into the morph of linguistic innovation, seems awkward, almost a failure. later on he makes yet another bold stab with the sirens chapter yet once again we feel that perhaps he has not utilized his full resource of verbal platinum but then we watch him triumph in totalica with the circe chapter, a real ambush of drama, as he thus becomes the full-fledged master of english that he is known for. in the ithaca chapter once he again he amazes us not only with his skillfull use of vocabulary but also his splurging curiosity and his megalo-titantic wealth of knowledge. then finally we read the penelope chapter, a piece that perhaps probes the folds and recesses of the soul more so than any other piece in literature. it is a trophy of poetry, a capitalization on the self and a robust affirmation of life.kyle foley, author of Lorelei Pursued and Wrestles with God"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses (Everyman's Library, 100)When I ordered this book,(oct 08) the \\"look inside book\\" option showed the copy with blue covers, title on cover.

Joyce shows here that to get the technique down right you need more than technique, even more than a command of the English language, you need a good viewpoint. And Ulysses has many, from Bloom to his wife Molly to Dedalus, every person is detailed through their thoughts and words with enough dimension to make you wonder if this is a novel or a true account. Is it difficult to read? Yup. Most parts you can at least figure out what's going on but some, like the play section toward the middle, at times makes absolutely no sense (and what is up with that, is it a dream or something), but some parts that you think would be impossible, like the massive sequence at the end with Molly not only is nearly compulsively readable but quite beautiful at the same time. It's weird to say this but at times I wanted the book to be longer. Simply put, one of, if not THE greatest novel ever to come out of the English language (though I'm a Pynchon fan first . . . sorry), one of those few novels that everyone should at least attempt, if only to immerse yourself in the complexity of the language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I first read Ulysses as an Eng.Lit. student in the 1960's, I knew I had to become a creative writer. Ulysses is my vade-mecum. When I am having problems writing a novel, or am dissatisfied with reviews, I turn to Joyce's masterpiece and gain fresh hope and inspiration. This is the book to beat all books - the Book of books. I never work on Bloomsday: I go down to Davy Byrnes public house in the centre of Dublin and order what Leopold had. Ulysses is not a difficult work, but it's very funny and very,very human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce is the leading literary light of the 20th century. His command of the language is masterful and like the truly great writers, the English language is better for his use of it. His experimentation with stream of consciousness in the opening of the century profoundly shaped the literature that followed. Joyce will be remembered as one of the greatest writers ever to have lived: his writing is true virtuosity in both form and substance. He ranks with Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton and Tolstoy. It may help to read this work with guidance by a teacher or professor. If that's not possible, after reading it in college and more recently, I recommend that you read it chapter for chapter with Homer's Odyssey or with a guidebook like Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses: otherwise, the intricate structure of the work may be lost. Bloom is 20th century man: to understand him is to peer into the inner depths of one's own being. Ulysses is magnificent. I stand in awe of this work. I am humbled by it. A more gifted literary genius may never have walked the planet and may never inhabit it, again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This novel was OK, but I didn't feel like it was speaking to me. Then again, I was reading it in a VERY dark room, and I didn't pause for lunch. This is a long book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"i completed Ulysses,,,,,,, and found it best as one would read a diary. I use it as a travelogue of the times of the Irish in theearly 1900s in Dublin, with numerous references to characters of the times, patriots , authors,and issues of the day,,,Flashforward,,,, Joyce work can be very useful in understanding the layout and forces at work in the background of modern Irish artists, ie U2. The creative forces that inspired Joyce are still at work, and have evolved in the modern generations still growing and aspiring to right the wrongs , improve the social conditions , and achieve some aspect of honorglory and success . Ulysses is a tremendous historical documentof those muliple influences that create a Joyce or a Bono."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.&quot;James Joyce"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book took me two months of steady reading to finish. I understood about 30% of it. Was it worth it?Yes:1. The inner-monologue technique really opened up for me on a second reading, and you realise how close to reality Joyce's representation of inner thought is.2. The main character is kind of interesting. A bumbling middle-aged man with lots of curiosity for life and sensitivity to others who is subjected to a range of humiliations throughout the day, from the small (being ignored as he says hello) to the highly disturbing (his wife sleeping with another man in their bed). The interesting part is how Bloom deals with these humiliations. Not angry, and not self-consciously depressed - he just continues on with his day and his thoughts, but you sense that these experiences have changed him in some way.3. There is plenty of interesting commentary on Catholic theology, literary theory, and some of Ireland's history around 1900. If you don't find those subjects interesting, much of this book will bore you.No:1. There is no \\"story\\". No drama, no build up of suspense, no climax, no resolution. The focus is not on a plot, it is directly on the characters, and to a less interesting extent on the language. Entertainment is hard to come by, unless you are satisfied by faintly humourous banter.2. Quite a few of the episodes are very self-indulgent. Joyce was a Modernist, so he was trying to play with forms of representation. One of the episodes is written entirely in the form of a song. Good luck making sense of it.Overall:The book is not worth reading in toto. But parts of it are. If you want to read the best of the novel, just read the Calypso, Hades, Cyclops, Nausicaa and Penelope episodes. That's about 300 pages, and quite worth the effort. You can read summaries of the rest of the novel from one of the many sites on the net.P.S. I leave out the episodes featuring Stephen Dedalus because his character is just a regurgitation of all the philosophers he has read. Sounds like a genius at first, but goes nowhere."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"you have the attention span to tackle it. I suggest buying Gifford's annotations to have in hand while you do."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is beyond the review and criticism of the multitudes. Only James Joyce, I believe, could adequately review himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Modern Library (Random House) has ranked Ulysses by James Joyce to be the #1 fiction of the 20th century.Now the question is does it deserve to be called the best fiction of the century?The answer will depend on your background and tastes. If you enjoy philosophy, heavy symbolic imagery, psychology, analysis of religious corruption, drawing parallels between Greek Myths and everyday life, and learning new english words then you will undoubtedly get the most out of Ulysses.I personally think that Ulysses is a great choice as the best fiction of the century because it covers almost *all aspects* of life from romance to racism. And it is one of the first books that lets you really see how the mind works (i.e. &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; technique). But it is probably this psychological aspect of the novel that turns people off. If one can get past this barrier than it can be seen that Ulysses is truly worthy of its #1 ranking.Homer's Odyssey (from which &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the main character) is considered to be one of the greatest books of western literature of all time. It is only fitting that Ulysses fills this role in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One thousand years from now, when the acid will have long since dissolved the remembrance's from our tombstones and even the internet will have been forgotten, Joyce's works will still be read and loved. His works will outlive our language as Homer's have their greek.I sympathize with those of you who are puzzled, angered and allow yourselves to be defeated by the text. It is much easier to read an accessible classic like The Lord of the Rings (the peoples choice for novel of the century) or The Catcher in the Rye, though they are unrewarding and juvenile works in comparison with Ulysses.As to those of you who pretend to be intellectually superior to Ulysses or the Wake, stop kidding yourselves. Among writers in the english tongue, Joyce ties for second place with Chaucer, just ahead of Milton, a stride behind Shakepeare."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Dear Amazon:How could it be that you publish a review submitted by someone who at the same time admits not having read the book while he rates it with 5 stars?

And it is a composition.Why should the reader work?So that he/she might learn something substantial; so that he/she will be able to view the world with a new mind's eye.Does it suffice to read the book only once and quickly?Nope.Diagnosis for anyone who assigns the book less than five stars:idler; incapable of intense intellectual effort; probably likes vonnegut."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It was Joyce's stated intention to keep the academics busy for years chasing down the innumerable and vague references buried in virtually every line of his over-long master work, and he succeeded. Why Joyce would set out to purposefully confuse and mislead critics and readers can only be explained by his overbearing, self-absorbed, pretentious nature. A thorough study of Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Portrait of the Artist - two foundations upon which Ulysses was constructed - will assist the reader in navigating Joyce's murky waters - but not nearly enough to make the effort enjoyable and worthwhile. Stuart Gilbert's famous study will bring the reader further into Joyce's stream of consciousness - but Gilbert chooses to be pretentious and occasionally obscure as well (no surprise since Gilbert and Joyce were collaborators). Joyce was a first rate literary artist - no mistake. Ulysses stands as a milestone in the art form - in many respects the first true &quot;modern&quot; novel (for better or worse). However, for the clerisy of readers, Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist are the limits for appreciating Joyce. Ulysses steps over the line, leading to Finnegan's Wake, which is completely out-of-bounds. Those who do make the effort necessary to understand Joyce's work in Ulysses will come to realize that, rather than celebrate and memorialize the Dublin he knew - as Homer did for the Hellenic world in The Odyssey (creating a lasting vision of the Greek world as the Greeks saw it) - Joyce lays his world in waste and ruin, leaving the landscape in desolation. Joyce's bottom line message can only be interpreted one of two ways: first, that the Heroic Age is so far removed (keeping in mind that Joyce considered the Irish to be Greek descendants) as to be unrelated (if not in opposition) to modern events; or second, that man is incapable of heroism in any form. An interesting interpretation of Joyce's Ulysses is its relationship to the science of chaos, in its complex formation. However, chaos (or more strictly speaking, non-linear dynamic systems) that exists in reality produces incredible complexity from surprisingly simple, non-linear feedback systems. Joyce constructed his work by merging too many source motifs with the intention of creating complexity. In the end, it is the overwhelming negativism that wins out in Joyce's Ulysses, without redemption. Ulysses is one of the great over-praised works. Over-praised because it is inherently flawed, as most great experiments are bound to be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The novel of the century! &quot;Time&quot; Magazine got it right! And &quot;Ulysses&quot; really is a comedy. A long comedy, albeit, but I find that opening the book at random and reading a page or two is an enriching experience.

So far it seems only a desire to render predictable, sophomoric on-line reviews in the Q&amp;A catechism style of the Ithaca episode....And for you who just doesn't feel the five-star bravado which so many others wield in touting Ulysses, it's OK- you're still a good person- and actually more the 'Everyman' for whom Joyce (supposedly) had sympathy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a fantastic novel...it is really beyond a novel and beyond reproach.

All that expensive German philology and bibliographic science bound with bubble-gum and rubber cement. I don't pretend to be fully apprised of the respective merits of the various editions (although I do understand that the original 1934 U.S edition was a pirated and notoriously erroneous text) but you might do well to consider the revised 1961 Ulysses(i.e. The Vintage Books and Modern Library text), over this, the scholarly standard, cursed with a nickel-dime spine."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The binding on the Viking edition is absolutely miserable.

YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark. But I grow wordy . . ."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What many consider to be Joyce's masterpiece is, to be frank, by no means his best work. &quot;Ulysses&quot; takes Joyce's use of realism and disjointed language to an extreme that causes most readers to lose interest in the story and the messages contained within. No work in which the style causes the vast majority of the readers (even of the highly educated readers) to become disallusioned and pretty much sick of can be considered a true masterpiece.

Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When read by those looking for prose, they go away disappointed. When read by those seeking poetry, they can't put it down.

The words kept me there for many, many more hours (and just a few pints). Imagery started leaping out at me, I felt as if I was hallucinating. Not for the timid, weak, or close-minded, but worth the effort if you want to give yourself up to a good book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many have said that Ulysses is the greatest novel written in English in the 20th century. Technically speaking, it's certainly unimagineable that any author could have put more into a book in this or any other century. But it's not for all tastes. You should read Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist before attempting Ulysses, as the former are more accessible and will let you know whether you like Joyce. Read the World's Classics edition of Ulysses, the notes are very helpful. Be prepared to work at this book. It takes some getting used to. Having read it, I think the effort was worth it. Joyce is a genius (evident from his earlier works). His writing is almost lyrical at times and every word is chosen deliberately to achieve the overall impression he seeks to make. He was one of the Protean Modernists, though, and in Ulysses he takes Modernism, the novel and literature itself to their outer limits. At times, thoughts and actions, reality and imagination all get mixed up in this book and sometimes the narrative line just seems to disappear - but isn't this the way of the human psyche? Don't expect Dickens or a plot in its normal sense. Do expect, after all the hard work is done, to marvel at the author's abilities and to have a warm feeling for Leopold Bloom, to wonder at his humanity and to do this despite the character's weaker traits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you're like me and you like a good brain raping now and then, you'll want to pick up this book.

You have to be pretty well read to approach this novel. Most of the book is inner monologue style, and it is 99% full of obscure references. It helps to have at least some background in the Odyssey and the Bible to understand this novel. I personally do not like a \\"talking heads\\" novel, so I find that I am simply skimming the pages out of boredom. Most of the book's references are very dated so you'll find that most of the text goes \\"over your head.\\" I salute those who \\"get\\" this novel, because you must be quite a worldly individual to not need help with it.

You really need alot of patience, a huge dicitonary, a small library of other classic novels, and an understanding of Ireland's history to get through it. I will finish this book, but I will not have taken in a single word at the end. If you MUST read this book, I highly recommend the SPARKnotes to go with to even get an idea of what you just read. Without it, you will just give up. I only gave it 3 stars because if I understood what I read, I could honestly tell you whether I liked it or not, but since I don't understand 98% of the book, I'll just sit \\"middle of the fence.\\"Also as a side note, don't get this version of the novel because the binding is total [...]"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, I just gave only four stars to a book that is universally known as one of the greatest works of literature of all time. I left off the extra star just because I have to review it from my own perspective. I'm an older guy who never got around to reading Joyce back in my college days, and have always figured I should.I love complex books--books that require some effort on my part to get through and appreciate. Joyce plowed ground for such novels. But there are a lot of good ones by more modern authors such as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster-Wallace, Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Barbara Kingsolver, etc. etc. etc. All of those books have a lot more action--Ulysses spends too much time with thought and reflection, without enough happening. Part of the challenge of reading Joyce is that he constantly refers to facts and customs and ideas from his time and place, so understanding requires some historical research, which is a diversion from the enjoyment of the literature. It's much more fun to read Pynchon (for example) because the challenges are ones that are supposed to be challenging. In short, I think it's great to catch up on historically important literature, but don't let it divert you from the many great works of more contemporary authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Tough to be critical of a classic, but this book will not be finished! There is little context and .frankly, it makes my head hurt just trying to read it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"See my review for &#34;The Age of Innocence&#34; - it completely describes how I feel about this book and how unreadable it is."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can't be sure that my rating reflects the author's work more than it does the publisher's and editor's.Notwithstanding, there's quite a bit of brilliance in the writing style and the techniques the author employs to tell the story. Only what story he is telling, I cannot say. For the entire book I couldn't grasp the flow or meaning of the story. Of course I could read for pages and understand the mood and the speaker. But I have no clue what the book is about.And one wonders how it achieved \\"Classic\\" status."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Hard to read, but I'm really glad I read it. It has influenced so many other works. While discussing this book with another friend, he summed it up well -- \\"It's like eating a really, really good meal... of vegetables.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While this text is undoubtedly one of the most difficult that I have read, the sheer skill at manipulating language that Joyce demonstrates is remarkable. The result is a novel that offers a most intimate study into the human method of thinking.Not for the faint of heart, however, because this is a text that requires dedication, as the games that Joyce plays with language and the thinking of his characters often obfuscates the meaning."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Mr. Joyce should be commended for writing a book which obviously needs careful interpretation to be understood. Simple things are not always best.The most important questions which the novel raises, for this reader, is: To what extent is literary criticism a rigorous discipline? I'm sure one can place interpretaions on the way Joyce uses language, and what he alludes to: but how many other, competing, interpretations can one put upon it and can one credibly say that one interpretation is (in any sense) better than another?And if the answer to the first question is &quot;a great many&quot; and the answer to the second is &quot;no&quot;, then is not literary criticism as much a fiction as that which it surveys?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Man, this was a long book! No, really I mean really long. I swear this was longer than any book I have ever even looked at. You know, all of us have jobs, kids, TV shows and sports - who the hell has time to read something like this. I swear this would take me forever to read, AND that's if I gave up watching Pro-Wrestling. No kidding it's really that long.They say when the millenium comes we may need to stock up on necessities like toilet paper, well if you run out, I would recommend this book - not cause it's bad or anything (I wouldn't know I didn't read it) - but you would definitely not run out of paper for a real long time. I hear that it's supposed to be a classic or something, I guess that's cause it takes about 50 years to read. Take my word for it - IT'S LONG!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, so we know already that this book has been deemed 'The Greatest Book Ever Written' which is why, I must confess, I endeavoured upon it. I took no literature class concerning it, nor do I plan to. My only other experience with literature that is vaguely similar to this is 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon, which I read about a year ago. And although I found the esotericism in GR interesting and comparably relevant to my personal work, I actually found U to be a slightly more entertaining read. However, if it's 'entertainment' your looking for, don't read this. Go read a Stephen King book, or something. In fact, don't read anything, just go see the new Tomb Raider movie....I didn't give this book 5 stars, because, as it's been mentioned in other reviews, there were too many points in the book that I was wanting more. More wordy experiments, more originality. Too often, some sort of brilliant style will surface and then go away and drone on for another 50 pages until some other new and interesting element occurs again. Some may say that I'm simply saying that the book wasn't 'entertaining' enough, contradicting my argument in the previous P. Well, to those I say, whatever. I can deal with being a hypocrit. I mean, when you really think about it, there are two conflicting elements of human nature at work here, 1. the sort-of Americanization of a culture to need constant entertainment, and 2. the instinctive craving to learn. Which is more powerful in you?I will say that if you just want an interesting snippet of this book to read, I'd read the last chapter. This really made the book worth reading IMO. It's done without hardly any punctuation and it's left to the reader to cipher where sentences begin and end, really the definitive stream of conscious technique, but more than that, it's the most emotionally powerful section of the book, right up to the last few words."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As I read Ulysses, I asked myself, what is the point of putting all these words next to each other? When I got to the end, (and not until then) I realized that this book is Joyce's search for God amid everyday life in Dublin. This God(the father) is one who is caring, concerned, shows consideration, and is also a cuckold. One of the greatest moments of my reading career was the question and answer session at the end of part 2, and it is very much worth the journey through the streets of Dublin of June 16, 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Another reviewer complained about &quot;Ulysses, the Corrected Text&quot; as a rewrite by Danis Rose; it is NOT. The Bodley Head (London, 1984) edition of this name was edited by Hans Walter Gabler and has a preface and recommendation by Richard Ellmann, the foremost biographer of James Joyce. This edition is a significant contribution to Joycian publishing and a &quot;must&quot; addition to any complete library of Joyce's works, alongside any of the &quot;original&quot; text works. Joyce's manuscript as sent to the printers was difficult to read (it had many handwritten corrections of corrections and border notes which the original publisher could not decide whether he was supposed to use), and Gabler merely did a highly-regarded job of reconsidering original manuscript materials and other sources. The first- or second-time reader of Ulysses likely would not notice the differences in the text, but Joyce scholars and Ulysses fans regard this as an important reconsideration and an essential work. Most editions of Ulysses use an identical numbering system for sections and paragraphs so that comparisons between editions are easy to make."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can anybody short of a literary genius review this book? I am certainly not qualified. I will simply tell you whether I enjoyed what I read.There were sections of the book that I really enjoyed but there were parts that seemed to me just a long procession of gibberish.Do not attempt to attempt this book without some study aids to assist you; unless you are a genius."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was finally able to get into _Ulysses_ this past February after trying for ten years or so. I just finished it (it's June). Phew!! Yes, it's a hard nut to crack -- you can see why so many people give up in rage and frustration (and unfairly express their resentment at being unable to understand by writing vitriolic reviews). And yes, if you're going to climb Mount Everest (or maybe K2 -- _Finnegans Wake_ appears to be Everest) you need an oxygen mask and a team -- get _The Bloomsday Book_ and _Ulysses Annotated_. But to say it was well worth it would be a giant understatement.I'll try to say in a nutshell what's so great (for me) about it: _Ulysses_ is the incredibly poignant story of one ordinary man's attempts to reconcile himself to his failures as a father, a husband and a human being. At the same time, through its rich description of Dublin (which comes to stand for every human community, everywhere); through a staggeringly complex web of historical, metaphorical and philosophical associations; and through Joyce's use of words, in which the English language _itself_ becomes a character in the novel, _Ulysses_ becomes about much, much more than a day in the life of one man -- it becomes a hugely cosmic-comic and very personal oddyssey through the readers' soul, in which every pretension or fantasy one could possibly have is brought to light and then smashed. Does this sound dismal? It isn't -- it's hilarious; and for those who've made it through, the ending words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy and her final &quot;yes&quot; are the sparkling, intoxicating wine of possibility -- heartbreakingly bittersweet, moving and transcendent."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let me first start off by saying I love the book. Its language is of the likes I have never before seen. And, let me also say, that while people who hate this book will try to totally disparage it and, in my opinion, try to burn it, if they had the chance, you, the prospective reader of this book, should cast aside all preconceived notions, whether yours or others', about this book. Just as well: throw my comments about the book away, and decide for yourself (because that is just what I said). But keep the idea of deciding for yourself, and disregard all the ploys that people will try to get you to not read this book, and go read this book, you just might enjoy it.Besides, how do other people know what you will like?

I am now rereading it while listening to an audio version at the same time. I love it. You should also know that I'm thoroughly familiar with the Dublin places described in the book.

I have started this book three times, at about two-year intervals, also reading small parts of it separately at various times, but I finally finished it straight through and I can't believe how great it is, I never expected this, though I've been half-obsessed with Joyce since I bought Finnegans Wake with perfect serendipity in seventh grade because I thought it had &quot;words I don't know.&quot; [Back to Ulysses] I've always loved the beginning, but it really gets a lot better past the halfway point, with Nighttown and the Ithaca chapter especially, and the thing that struck me most was the absolute loveliness of the ending. It's bloody famous and often quoted, but you don't get a sense until you've read the whole thing that where other books leave you begging for more or hoping them to come to an end more quickly, this ending is *perfectly* satisfying. [You can find more rigorous criticism elsewhere. This is my emotional response.]"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"That &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a great novel and a (not the) turning point in the history of modern imaginative prose is, I think, proven beyond reasonable doubt. But, after having read it twice, a nagging doubt remains: is it a life-enhancing achievement ? Like the best of Shakespeare or Tolstoy. Does it achieve universality beyond obvious plodder-type references harking back to Homer ? Which are pros and cons ? Among pros, I'd say that most important are exuberant playfulness of language and gorgeously hilarious stampedo of comic banal incidents. Joyce is truly great comic writer. As for his status of the progenitor of experimental prose, I'm more sceptical. The stream of consciousness technique remained confined mostly to English-language literatures; what's more objectionable, it doesn't seem to possess potency of meditative-reflective approach of a Conrad or Proust, nor direct prophetic insight of a Dostoevsky or Lawrence. There is something arid and self-defeating in the very nature of Joyce's endeavor. Among cons two come to mind immediately: a scholastic network of cross-references that serves as the underpinning of the entire structure-something that impresses a naive innocent reader as an erudition beyond, beyond...but, actually is an exercise in a dated and dead world view ( and even this is far from being impeccable-Joyce's reading in philosophy is superficial; he confuses Duns Scotus and Johanes Scotus Erigena ); the other con is the all-pervading banality of virtually everything. As if a double perspective is achieved simultaneously: Joyce's work is as detached as possible, yet, its all-devouring meaninglessness betrays the author's mindset. And this mindset I would call as subjective and life defeating as any imaginable. Conclusion: Joyce's inventiveness and humor produced a great book. At the same time, his aesthetic pseudoreligion and something I could call only a soulless Weltanschauung prevented him to create a summit like &quot;A la recherche&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Devils&quot;. A great novel. Among the most influential. Not among the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Although I enjoy using Anthony Burgess', &quot;Joyce Prick,&quot; as a walking guide through Ulysses, it's not a difficult read. However, the best part about Ulysses is that no matter your view, no one will ever agree with it!Ulysses is best understood, in my opinion, by the male aged 35 to 50. It is the story of Bloom's passage into middle age. His last bit of memory, physical or mental, of his youth. He is passing on to new memories, but allows for one final mental seduction.In the meantime, his wife, Molly, is also passing. She has allowed herself, in her own final touch with youth gone, to be physically seduced.In the end, Molly and Bloom rejoin. Life goes on; youth is dead.I guess that I will always love this book, however, I will always be amazed at how simple it is and how much has been written analyzing it.

If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When one looks at Ulysses by James Joyce without prior knowledge, one comes in with pre-conceptions of what should be expected. They find it difficult and confusing and without purpose. Some say it is an exercise in intellectually masturbatory narrative, some say it is just a terrible work completely without merit. To those I say, look at Picasso, van gogh or any other artist for that matter and you will gain an appreciation for the work. Let me explain myself.Joyce was quoted as saying something to the effect of \\"If Dublin disappeared off the face of the earth, this book would be able to recreate it down to the last detail\\" now while that is a tad hyperbolic, he illustrates the main point of the novel. To paint a picture of dublin. Imagine a landscape painting be it an urban, idyll, or what have you. You don't necessarily approach it with a plot in mind, you simply enjoy the sites as they are. That is what this book is. Joyce's methods of achieving it are what separate this from the other works of any literary genre.It is a painting in the truest sense of the word. Each chapter forms a kaleidoscope of narrative, point of view and immersive yet alienating sensory details. This hodgepodge of narrative styles can infuriate or delight as it paints with immense detail a single day in the life of one Leopold Bloom.To be sure there are chapters that are extremely opaque and less sensory based than others, but this is a way of enhancing the narrative differences of each chapter. Every chapter is a microcosm of narrative which ultimately creates the macrocosm of the work as a whole. Take for example chapter 15: Circe, this is written as a script. Chapter 17: Ithaca a catechism, Chapter 18: penelope is the purest stream of consciousness ever written.And to those detractors who argue that plot is important, keep in mind not all literature has the intention of telling a story.So I leave you with this. This book is difficult, I'm not going to lie, the first read will be infuriating as almost a guarantee, but with a mindset of Painting over story you may perhaps enjoy it as such and find this review at least somewhat helpful"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is specifically for the Naxos AudioBooks production of Ulysses. Nowhere on the Amazon website (although I have now requested this change) does it say that this audiobook is ABRIDGED! The quality of the performances are so far outstanding, but it was disconcerting, to say the least, to be in the middle of Book I and suddenly be transported to Book IV. I purchased the audiobook to help me as I read through the book itself, so to that extent the audiobook abandoned me just when I needed it most, as Book III is rather arduous. It is still worth it to me since the only other audiobook is going for almost $150, and as I'm reading the book in its entirety I will not be limited to the abridged story.

I was looking to save a few dollars and read a great classic and instead I have a five-pound doorstop."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It looks as if an improved Project Gutenberg text can be downloaded to Kindle. The issues of missing text are fixed at least in a spot-check of the opening chapter. I just checked with a new download via the PG website of a 1.72 mb file. But, as of today, you have to do it yourself, not via the instant function here. (Amazon's site is not aligned to do this as of this date of writing. I note as I write this Amazon posted a note that the Kindle free [aka Project Gutenberg] text is not available and that they are looking into reported problems as an \\"item under review.\\")I had first downloaded the free file a few weeks ago (pg4300.mobi @ 1.7 mb) to my Touch. I found that in the the Martello scene, for instance, \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus\\" sung memorably by Malachi was missing. Other ditties, such as \\"I am the boy...invisibility\\") indicated by indentation in standard form (even in the e-book online via Gutenberg-dot-org) were missing as well from the Kindle version of the free text. In other places, if not surprisingly, spacing was off. I assume later chapters may have lacked the graphic designs that the novel relied upon as to punctuation and page presentation. The spacing looks a little better in the updated download. Let's hope these matters have been corrected, thanks to Gutenberg's team of volunteers for a valuable service after so many decades of copyright control beyond reasonable limits exerted by the author's estate against creative uses.One challenge, if not to be blamed on any version of Joyce's text as published originally. The e-books come in parts I (Stephen), II (Bloom) and III (Molly). So, the chapters attributed later on are not included, but they may be on electronic resources that are not the public domain one, as added value. I cannot figure out on a Kindle how to make bookmarks and label them as to chapters--I did this on an Aldiko version on my phone.Finding gratis a public domain (finally!) version despite its drawbacks is wonderful. I cannot fault those who prepared a difficult text for an e-book for free. There are other versions for sale that are nicer, and they merit their own reviews by others, but Amazon heaps all media for many texts in the public domain together, so rating the medium is jumbled with the content itself, no easy solution.Making e-books off of a notoriously unstable ur-text that's long tested the patience of any Joycean editor already isn't easy. So, the bulk of the novel's intact for reference, concordance work, and looking up passages or phrases nearly instantly. It can always be compared to the Gabler or Random House eds., of course. It's great to have my favorite novel even in its rawer form, to look up or dip into on a Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough good things have been said about Ulysses, and most of them are true. You should benefit greatly from reading such a wondrous masterpiece. But if you are serious you should shy away from the Gabler Edition. It is widely considered among Joyce scholars, and even some of Gabler's original advisers, that he took way too many liberties when producing this edition. He made many noted blunders and errors. In essense, Gabler damaged the script with his misguided sense of editing.I have read the Gabler Edition, and really didn't know better at the time. It was still brilliant and I loved it, but I defer to the experts. I now own the Random House edition, and have skipped around to reread parts of it. Supposedly the Penguin and Everyman's Library editions are worthy reprints of the 1960 edit. There is a forthcoming edit from Norton that is anticipated as becoming the new definitive edit, but they have been delayed in getting it out. Be careful about which edition you get. Some are reprints of the original edition, which contains many errors. Go with Penguin, Everyman's or Random House for now.Also, this Vintage edition is horribly made. The book binding frayed and the book fell apart after a year; the pages all fell out (some individually, but mostly in clumps of 10 to 100 pages)and I was desperately and pathetically trying to keep them together and in order (I was only trying to hold on to the book because of my extensive margin notes). After, a while I just gave up and vowed never to buy Vintage again.I plan on rereading Ulysses, but in a different edition than Vintage. I read it along with The New Bloomsday Book by Harry Blamires. It is an extremely helpful and well regarded commentary/guide."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Don't read \\"Ulysses\\" because of what other people say about it or how highly it's usually ranked among great 20th-c. novels; if you don't like it, move on to something else. But if Joyce intrigues you, well, you've got a lifetime to sort it all out. I've read the book several times and it's never the same experience--Joyce is always many steps ahead of me. When I first read \\"Ulysses\\" as an insufferable young man of 19, I kept thinking, \\"Why does he write this way?\\" (Along with, \\"Why am I not 'getting' it?\\") (Because I was only 19, I guess, and I tried to plow through it quickly so I could tell everyone that I \\"read 'Ulysses'!\\". Ouch.) And talk about slow reading! Let your eyes melt into a paragraph or a sentence. Let it sink in! Perhaps the ideal reader of Joyce is the one who memorizes the entire thing. Let me explain: Everything in \\"Ulysses\\" is interrelated. I'll bet there aren't 20 facts in the book that don't relate somehow to other aspects of the book. He'll mention something in chapter 3, and by chapter 10 he'll mention something else about it. \\"Oh, right; chapter 3.\\" You know, sort of like in real life. Joyce could have written the book normally, but I'm glad he didn't. Like asking Bach to make his fugues simpler. What's the point? and who has the right. Joyce is not deliberately obscure; to me, he's one of the least obscure writers ever. Paging Aristotle! To me, he had the most control over his words of any author who ever lived. (Again, it's all interrelated.) So yes, the book is not going to come alive on the first reading. Poor baby. Takes more than that to peel this onion. If you were to look up all of the allusions etc. in this book, you'd have a solid liberal-arts education. But you don't have to, of course. It's just that the more you know, the more you'll get out of this book. Would that I were raised in Dublin. Oh well; we don't fault Homer for being Greek now do we. And I'm taken aback by some of the Woolf-ian critiques here. Like Voltaire on that \\"barbarian\\" Shakespeare. Like Shaw, Wyndham Lewis weren't jealous; they just hated him because he was so darn good. And even Jung was puzzled; what, hadn't he been studying myth his whole life? Maybe the book seemed more radical in the 1920s. But Joyce wasn't trying to be \\"modern\\" or \\"avant-garde.\\" He couldn't care less about that surreal stuff either. So, \\"Ulysses\\" is perhaps the final book of a long tradition, the fullstop of the West. (Scan the Internet for some articles and join some chat-groups if you don't believe me.) Now, wait; what about \\"Finnegans Wake\\"? Arrrrrrrghhhh!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is without question the most difficult book I have ever read. It is also the most interesting, descriptive, imaginative, funny, poignant, life-affirming, and learned book I have ever read. As someone nearing 50 who has read broadly, I consider the experience of reading Joyce's masterpiece an achievement that was well worth the effort. And it was an effort.The Naxos audiobook was essential for me (I have the CD version, which I downloaded to my Ipod; I have seen comments suggesting that the Kindle version has technical glitches). I am not a particular fan of audiobooks, but the Naxos version is very well put together, and Jim Norton - who reads 98% of the book, does a phenomenal job covering the countless voices that enter and exit (and often reenter) the text. Then Marcella Riordan reads the final monologue of Molly Bloom and her delivery is equally impressive. My approach was to follow along with the text while listening to the audiobook, and then refer to Don Gifford's annoted notes (a separate volume) that provides very helpful background to the often obscure references. For difficult chapters I would also relisten/read the chapter, which always provided added value. It sounds like a slog, and I guess it was, but I repeat: I do not regret a minute of it. Very rewarding."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This, as it is for many, is a wonderful and challenging read, forcing you to work at reading at creating and meeting up with the author in this wonderful and truly rich fiction that truly is fiction in all senses - not following but breaking up, re-casting fictional elements as he goes. Fiction is not doing this challenging, and upsetting of fictional expectations so much I find, and when I come across any writer who does I have to read and read them over - for fear of how long it will be until I next meet with something that challenges, that moves things... recently I have enjoyed Ben MarcusNotable American Women: A Noveland also Jayne Joso'sPerfect ArchitectANDSoothing Music for Stray Cats- I strongly recommend both authors and these works - after your 1st or 3rd reading of our wonderful Joyce."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In about October I read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist As a Young man and loved it. This led me to look further into his work. I then went on to read his poetry and some of the sort stories in Dubliners but I really wanted to read another book by him, yet many people told me that Ulysses was impossible to read or full of modernist randomness. I decided to read it ANYWAY.The book starts off quirky and interesting and (yay!) Stephen Dedalus is back. Each chapter is written in the style that is best for the content and that is one of the things that really impressed me. It is not \\"random\\" without a purpose and a lot of this \\"randomness\\" actually makes sense if you can recognize and pay attention to the literary/biblical/mythological allusions. Most of them are quite brilliant and I quote it all the time.( \\"Shakespeare is the happy hunting grounds of all minds that have lost their balance\\" and such).It is totally worth the time it takes to read it!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"An outstanding audiobook, all the more valuable considering the difficulty of the text. I spend a lot of time in my vehicle and generally dread my commute. I often turn to audiobooks to feel that I am not wasting my life. I've listened to several good recordings now: Richard Wright's Native Son, Jack Kerouac's On the Road, Herman Hesse's Siddhartha, George Orwell's Animal Farm. All pale in comparison to Ulysses read by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As everyone knows this is a very difficult read. I am glad I did it for many reasons, not the least of which is that this book is so talked about and I now can say I at least read it. There were what clearly appeared to be entry errors (I believe this book is one of those where volunteers enter it into the system). This was not a serious problem. But with the language and phrasing and stream of conscience style that Joyce uses, there added to the difficulty of the read in a few spots.I also really wish Kindle would number the pages. I know this changes based upon the size type a reader may set his Kindle at. However, it would really enhance the reading experience. Even if the page broke in the middle of a \\"page\\" due to the size type that the reader selected, it would be most helpful. I think this is a standard complaint regarding the Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The performance of Donald Donnelly is certainly far better than Jim Norton's one in the Naxos edition of the talking book.

It helps a lot to find a particular passage or just to find the track that you last listened to.Naxos edition also has music that makes the experience of the talking book a better, more complete one. It also has a cdrom with plenty of information on Ulysses.Moreover, many of the female \\"voices\\" are read by Donald Donnelly whilst the female readeris more present in the Naxos edition.I am going to return this item and it is a shame because Donald Donnelly is really good. I can't say the same about Recorded Books lazy, disorganized edition.PS. There is one last thing. Some words read in this edition are different from what is in the book whilst Naxos edition is exactly like the book.The book I have is the Modern Library edition, 1992."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To fully appreciate Ulysses, one has to be aware how truly far ahead of its time this novel was. We have been through Faulkner stream-of-consciousness in high school and college English classes, and we can turn on the computer for live webcams all over the world, and we have been treated to the minutae of the Osbournes and other reality TV series. All of these - whether you consider them high art or dubious social experiments - are attempts to understand the human condition and the interaction among individuals in the most mundane of settings: daily life and relationships and the wandering life of the mind. Just as modern dramatists all stand on the shoulders of Shakespeare, so do modern literary writers stand on the shoulders of James Joyce. It is quite a hoot, however, to read what was deemed so &quot;obscene&quot; - we have sure come a long way (or fallen a long way, however you choose to look at it) - but the sheer craft of this book cannot be denied. Literature turned a sharp corner with this work. Yes, some of the passages can become tedious - and the references obscure (but even if you don't look them up, the overall effect is not lost) - it is best to read those long musing rambles almost with soft-focus eyes and let your mind flow with the words as if they were your own interior monologue. Another useful approach is to read them like poetry. Some of the phrases are just delicious and could stand on their own, perhaps like free verse or haiku. On first try, I didn't make it through Ulysses - a couple of years later, I tried again and took the pressure off myself to understand every sentence or to follow the &quot;story.&quot; I just read, and became completely engrossed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems, in this new century of total instant access to everything, that the accepted way of persuading people to read \\"Ulysses\\" is to say that it's a damn fine book but you need to be an experienced reader with a lot of time on your hands and plenty of patience...etc. Let's get a few things clear. This is not the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\". There is not some algorithm you have to work out in advance in order to enjoy this book. It's a novel. It's a good read. The other stuff, the background stuff, the structural cunning and the wide-ranging allusiveness, is there in case you want to read it again. Basically, this is an unusually intelligent novel, in a basically comic mode, that plays a few games with the ways that we (sometimes lazily) tend to read. The rest is just a bonus. Joyce is just so generous in his joking and his desire to give us more than we normally expect from a book that we can get a bit overwhelmed by the cornucopia of stuff that he lays at our feet.I first read Ulysses when I was about 17 - I was still in what Americans would call high school, I wasn't reading it because I had to, but because I had heard it was supposed to be one of the best books around and it was set in the city around which I had grown up. I found the first three chapters a bit tricky but I kept going, because it seemed to me that the guy knew what he was doing. Then I got to the fourth chapter, and it suddenly became much easier. It seemed to me that this was the kind of thing that most of the writers I liked were trying to do, but most often failed at, because they just weren't this good. Joyce is supremely good at conveying the physical sensations of being alive - what it's like to be hungry, sad, lustful, worrisome, tired, hopeful, nervous. As the book went on, I knew I wanted to trust this guy. In the later sections, Joyce seemed to be expecting what I wanted to happen, and seemed determined to persuade me that how I wanted the book to develop wasn't necessarily the best way for the book to go - and I believed him. Since I hadn't read many \\"great\\" novels, his changes in style seemed to me to be exactly the sort of thing that an adventurous writer should be doing. I thought then, and still think, that he can be a bit garrulous, but he's such a skilful writer that I don't wish he'd made the book any shorter than it is.By the end, Ulysses had come to represent my basic idea of a really great novel. I had no notion that most novels aren't anything like as daring or as enjoyable. The only other novels I've read since which are both as courageous and as entertaining as this one are Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\". Which, I know now, will tell you a lot about my taste in fiction.You really don't need to be an expert reader to appreciate \\"Ulysses\\". If anything, it's better if you have either read everything, or next to nothing. The notes are handy, if you want to know all that's going on - and I don't see why that should hurt. But even without them, Joyce - as they used to say of a certain brand of beer - can reach parts that other writers (or for that matter, beers) can't reach. He is a truly wonderful writer, and I'm (foolishly) proud that the greatest of novelists in the English language was an Irishman.People are still writing great novels - Pynchon's last was a lovely late masterpiece, and Don DeLillo is as vigorous as ever. But my personal opinion is that Joyce kicked a flagging Victorian form into new life, and the impact of his scuffed tennis shoe is still raw and smarting. \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is still awaiting the readers it deserves. In the meantime, there's no reason why any curious reader shouldn't get something out of \\"Ulysses\\". It's my favourite novel. It's also the best Irish book so far. Mind you, I can't wait till Mairtin O Cadhain's \\"Cre na Cille\\" gets translated into English..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Ulysses&quot; is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding book that I have ever read. Its slow pacing and density frustrated me the first time through, although the book provided enough snippets of briliance that I kept reading. However, after putting it on the shelf for a year, I picked up a copy of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer and read the two side by side. This made the events in &quot;Ulysses&quot; much more understandable, as Joyce borrowed the structure of his book from &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; It also helped me glimpse the true brilliance of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. By taking one of history's most epic tales and overlaying it onto a single day in the life of an average, unremarkable man, both books furthered my understanding of the common aims and desires of all people. If you buy &quot;Ulysses&quot;, pick up &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as well; this, more than any &quot;Joyce 101&quot; guides, will help you understand thiss fascinating and multilayered book. If you give it time and don't concern yourself with how long it takes to read, this book will grow on you and you will realize how many insights it provides on the human condition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses (1922) breaks traditional conventions of fiction: like Finnegans Wake (1939) it can hardly be appreciated completely unless passages are read aloud; like Homer's Odyssey it chronicles a plot of epic proportions, with details so rich and colourful they virtually epitomize realism and the stream-of-consciousness technique; and like the short stories in Joyce's Dubliners (1914) or Classical Greek drama, it focuses on a very specific, particular situation: a day in the life of a Dublin canvasser, Leopold Bloom.Ulysses gained a favourable reputation among Modernist contemporaries like Ezra Pound. Its inclusion of the vulgar language of Dublin's people was offensive to many, leading to public book-burnings and prohibitions against its publication. By the 1960s, when such concerns over language had dissipated, Ulysses still remained the esoteric interest of a limited number of readers. This is due partly to the text's numerous obscure passages and its reputation for being a &quot;difficult&quot; text. However, a basic knowledge of the Odyssey and an acceptance of the stream-of-consciousness technique -- which had, we should note, been employed in limited measure by writers like Dickens -- allows the patient reader to revel in decoding the text's plot, its puns, and its symbolic levels of meaning. Indeed, many editions of the work feature outlines listing some of the main features of each passage -- the equivalent of the pithy chapter titles that usually accompany the text of more traditional novels.Ulysses chronicles a place and time (Edwardian Dublin) but also a site and an age (the city and the 20th century). It does so with language that reflects the irony and fragmentation associated with the Modern era and its problems, as related in the novel. It took many laborious years to write (arguably, only Finnegans Wake would be more challenging to its author). Nonetheless, both of Joyce's long works have been immense influences on fiction and poetry in this century: they have re-asserted and re-emphasized the non-linear, non-written aspects of language (e.g. the Wake begins by ending its last sentence); they have (in Derrida's estimation) overturned Western society's privileging of speech (logocentrism) over writing (since many of the words and puns can only be understood via reading them on the page); and yet they retain a simple, straightforward backbone of human experience, connectedness, and imagination as their primary themes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is an episode of the British TV series \\"Black Books\\" (a surreal comedy set in a second hand bookshop) where Manny says to his cruel employer Bernard: \\"I just sold that customer a copy of \\"Ulysses\\", \\"The Guide to Ulysses\\" and \\"A Handbook to the Ulysses Guide\\". Now surely that deserves a star.\\" This episode is even funnier now that I've read \\"Ulysses\\" for myself. Any reader who actually manages to get through \\"Ulysses\\" probably deserves a star as well.I read this book because it was reported to be controversial and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I knew Anthony Burgess (the author of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") was an expert on James Joyce and I've read other books that are written in strange versions of English (\\"The Night Land\\" by William Hope Hodgson, \\"Riddley Walker\\" by Russell Hoban and the aforementioned \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"). It was interesting to learn that James Joyce was the writer who invented the lingual style known as \\"stream of consciousness\\".Having already read a Penguin Classics edition of \\"A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man\\", I thought I'd give \\"Ulysses\\" a shot. The copy of \\"Ulysses\\" that I read was a hardcover 1966 edition, published by Bodley Head. At 933 pages, the book posed an additional challenge by having no introduction at the front and no explanatory notes at the back. The plain green cover had no illustration and no blurb. Nevertheless I persevered.So what is \\"Ulysses\\" actually about? The only way a reader can appreciate this book is to have a knowledge of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". That's what \\"Ulysses\\" is - a modern retelling of the Odyssey, taking place in Dublin on June 16 1904. There's no doubt that \\"Ulysses\\" caused a stir when it was first published (1922). People would have been more easily shocked back then. Even when the film adaptation was shown in New Zealand in the more liberated 1960s the audience was segregated by gender.If I have piqued a prospective reader's curiosity, all well and good. Although the book weighs 1 kilogram on the scales, \\"Ulysses\\" is definitely not light reading. As an experimental work, I would say that \\"Ulysses\\" does for literature what \\"Eraserhead\\" does for cinema. That's the best comparison I can think of. Read it if you can."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate \\"How to\\" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is the best and most readable edition of Ulysses available. As far as tackling the book goes... well, you get out of it what you put into it, but be prepared to put a lot into it. Simply: Don't read Ulysses because you feel like you have to or you should, read it because you want to and don't be too proud or afraid to seek out help.I was lucky enough to tackle this book in a classroom setting but it is not so utterly incomprehensible as to make that the only way to understand it. There are many guides (Stuart Gilbert's was the one we used but I suspect there are better. I even found sparknotes useful just for a chapter summary after reading.) to help people through the text and its deeper workings.The real question is, why choose this version of Ulysses over another, cheaper version? The text has been thoroughly reworked and many publishing mistakes directly interfering, misinterpreting, or outright disregarding Joyce's plan for his book have been fixed. The editors have nothing but the utmost respect for Joyce and for Ulysses and that care is evident throughout the book as the hands of the editors remain invisible behind Joyce's words.So rant and rave and rant and rave but I nearly gave this 4 stars just because of the product. The book itself, the binding and the cover, are absolutely terrible. My book was brand new and my cover fell off before I was halfway through it. By the end of the course more than half the books in our class were damaged and many of them had pages falling out as well. There's no excuse for any book, let alone the most important book of the 20th century, to fall apart while reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have never heard anything like this before. It is sure fire to increase one's aesthetic sensibility and broaden one's sense of being alive."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce describes the ways that Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus follow, from dawn 'til night, on June 16, 1904. What's special about this day? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Bloom fixes breakfast, goes to the bathroom, does business, attends his friend Paddy Dignam's funeral, goes back to work, strolls on the beach, gets drunk with some friends, follows the party at a brothel, gets Dedalus out of a problem, and then invites him home for more drinks. Then he goes to sleep. Dedalus wakes up in Buck Mulligan's place (a tower), goes to teach at a school, wanders around the beach after visiting some relatives, goes to the library, in the evening he goes to a bar with some friends, and finally he meets Bloom at the brothel.This immeasurable book is a desperate attempt at capturing the present, which is constantly escaping: the present on the inside and the outside of people. It is an absolute witness of what the characters see, hear, fell, smell, and speak to themselves. It is looking for utter simultaneousness, trying to be an absolut record of everything that goes thorugh the bodies and minds of the main characters. Meanings? Symbols? Interpretations? Infinite. This book leaves, among many others, the sensation that it has passed and left us blank; that we didn't retain anything, that we hold nothing of it: exactly the same sensation that the present leaves on us.Every chapter parallels a chapter from Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and each is written in a different style. As a literary work of art, it is incomparable: it uses language, symbols, syntaxis, pronouns, time, everything, in a unique way, in order to depict for us what happens to a person in a normal day.A separate mention is deserved by the final chapter, the monologue of Molly Bloom. 50 pages without a period, a true masterpiece of stream-of-consciousness. A most faithful portrait of what goes through a woman's mind half awaken, half asleep, a summary of her life and her relationship with Leopold. It is necessary to read this passage in one single effort.When reading &quot;Ulysses&quot;, it is useful to keep in mind Marcel Proust's work. Proust seeks to recover the past long gone, while Joyce seeks to capture the present before it becomes past. This is an overwhelming book, irritating and, above all, admirable. It reaches unsuspected levels of creativity, experimentation and literary depth.Some people don't like it: that's their prerrogative. But to say this is a phony or bad book, is to acknowledge one's laziness as reader. They're losing a tour-de-force in literature. Be sure you don't suffer the same fate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Most parts of the book were difficult to understand. That means I didn't understand them.I started out thinking it would be a great journey to read the whole 700+ pages of great writing. As I went along, I found that I couldn't understand one-tenth of what was going on. Well, I had to finish the book because I wanted to experience what many people say is the greatest novel ever written.One thing I learned from reading this book is that when you are faced with something you don't understand, it is okay to get the hell out. Otherwise, you'd just be wasting 4 weeks of your life.Needless to say, I will never forget the four weeks I spent reading this book. I'd remember it as one of the darkest periods of my life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is one of the most widely discussed, debated, and disputed literary masterpieces of all time, yet surprisingly few of those who discuss it have actually read the book. Reasons range from sloth to intimidation to a flat-out lack of interest. It is important to have some basic knowledge of the premise of ULYSSES prior to reading it; two things are particularly critical to be aware of:1. ULYSSES is an allegory for Homer's ODYSSEY. The whole thing.2. All of the events of the novel span fewer than 24 hours.Trust me, knowing those two things makes ULYSSES make a whole lot more sense.Since ULYSSES is a notoriously difficult read, its readers have come up with various means by which to approach the novel. Different things work for different people, but what follows is my version of a \\"Reader's guide to ULYSSES\\":1. This one is critical: read James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN before ULYSSES. Not only does the former serve as a sort of primer for the latter, but A PORTRAIT introduces Stephen Dedalus, a key character in ULYSSES. Many of the events and circumstances of A PORTRAIT are referred to in ULYSSES, and Joyce will by no means spoon-feed you the connections.Supplemental pre-ULYSSES reading includes Homer's THE ODYSSEY and Joyce's DUBLINERS.2. Remember: this is supposed to be a funny book. If events seem absurd, disgusting, or nonsensical, there's certainly a reason.3. Take... your... time. I spent six weeks reading ULYSSES, and sometimes would spend up to five minutes on one page if I was confused or spacing out. This novel is, frankly, dense enough to sink in a pool of mercury. You aren't going to understand every pun, cultural allusion, or plot point even. Accept it: spend as long as you need, infer whatever you can, try your best, don't get frustrated.4. Do NOT give up! I read this as a 17-year-old; this is NOT an unreadable book! It is a very tough read, but not impossible. If you don't ever abandon ULYSSES, you're bound to finish it. Chapters are long; if you're burning out in the middle of one, just finish the next paragraph, stick your bookmark between the pages, and put ULYSSES on your nightstand for a while.All told, this is one of the greatest and most rewarding novels ever written. Give it a chance, prepare as suits you best, and have a nice read!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the more complete edition to which I refer in my review of the free Kindle version of Ulysses.

Still, this has the internal poetry, doggerel, etc. that the the free edition has excised.Update: This is now listed as Ulysses (Annotated Edition) for $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses at the end of my junior year in high school with absolutely no knowledge of how difficult or \`great' it was reputed to be. I just bought a used copy and started reading after an essay about it struck my fancy on the SATs. There will be people who tell you that Ulysses is a work of art that can be appreciated only by someone of great intelligence and a high level of education. There will be people who tell you that the book is comprised of pretentious dribble that no one actually understands; designed to make \`intellectuals' feel good about themselves for pretending to \`get' it. Both are wrong. Ulysses is just a book. There will be people who love it and people who hate it, regardless of their intelligence. If you hate it, it doesn't mean that you're stupid or that you don't \`get' it; it just means that it's not your cup o' tea. So why not give it a chance?Personally, I'm no genius, and I adored Ulysses. I didn't have to read it with a map, a dictionary, and a book of Irish proverbs at my side, either. Yes, to get every possible thing that you can get out of it, you'll need these things, but you don't need them to fall in love with the characters, laugh at their awkward conversations, or marvel at Joyce's use of language. Chances are, if you can make it through the book out of liking it- and not just out of a sense of duty- then you'll want to go back and read it again anyways (well, perhaps after a short break) so you don't need to understand every little detail your first time through.Because of its reputation, Ulysses does tend to attract either the snobs who quote the most difficult parts of the book as the \`greatest,' or the snobs who can't get over the fact that they don't enjoy one of the most famous books of all time and quote the most difficult parts of the book as a reason not to read it. This makes it seem more dense than it really is. If you're patient and willing to pay attention, Ulysses isn't nearly as difficult as it's reputed to be. Just use the \\"Search Inside\\" feature on this site and take a look at the first chapter. The language itself isn't too difficult, it's the fact that the language and technique do take some time to get used to- so by the time you get into the rhythm, a new chapter starts and the style of the prose changes altogether. You just need to read slowly and patiently- and for the love of God don't skip passages. Yes, there are maybe one or two chapters that are pretty tough (Oxen of the Sun, probably, is the most notable) but the vast majority of the book is perfectly easy to understand to the patient reader.If you do opt out of Ulysses, you'll miss out on some of the most awesome, well-developed, and loveable characters in all of literature. Because Joyce chronicles the stream of consiousness of the main characters in a few of the chapters, we not only get to see what they think, but how they think it. It's hard to explain but very cool. The brilliant, modest, and socially awkward Leopold Bloom takes the role of the 'hero' or 'Odysseus' of the story. There is no possible way for me to describe how deep, hilarious, tragic, and downright likeable he is. Sadly, no one in the book really enjoys his presence, and a cloud of awkward silence seems to follow him wherever he goes. Pretentious, moody, and selfish, Stephen Dedalus takes the role of Telemachus. He's angsty, introverted, sarcastic and incredibly funny. The more minor characters are just as important, notably Buck Mulligan, Stephen's obnoxious, smug, life-of-the-party type roommate (think of your typical frat-boy) is very funny (if incredibly annoying to Stephen,) as is Molly, Leopold's (somewhat understandably) unfaithful wife, whose inner thoughts make up the entirety of the book's completely unpunctuated final chapter. The jingoistic anti-Semite \\"The Citizen\\" and Stephen's clueless, annoying boss are also both amazing.The book doesn't follow The Odyssey religiously, but I did find myself thankful that I had read the Greek epic before approaching Ulysses. This edition doesn't have the names of the chapters, (I don't know if any edition does) and I would suggest finding out what they are and writing them in. They give a good idea of the general theme of each chapter, and the contrast between the ancient heroes (Odysseus and Telemachus) and the modern day heroes (Leopold and Stephen) is a huge point of interest. It's also good to have a decent knowledge of the history of Ireland. I did find myself wishing that I knew more about Shakespeare (Stephen's obsessed with Shakespeare and prattles on about him constantly), other famous authors and philosophers, different languages, and Irish culture and history, but the book taught me more than it stumped me.I am only eighteen, and even though I could talk about Ulysses all day, I know that I don't yet have the ability to even scratch the surface of its' complexity and depth. I certainly plan on reading and re-reading it as I become more educated, but the reason that I want to is because it is, in essence, a good, funny, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining read unto itself. Please, try not to pass up on it just because of its reputation."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you haven't read Ulysses yet, and feel daunted by the wildly different, extremely strident reviews of it, read on and I'll try to explain why this novel is worth your while.First, a brief summary. Ulysses attempts to capture what life was like in Dublin, Ireland, at the start of the twentieth century. It doesn't do this like a history book, solely in terms of political events and noteworthy individuals; rather, it attempts to convey the nature of the day-to-day lives of ordinary people by following its protagonist, an inoffensive fellow named Leopold Bloom, around the city. (It occasionally switches to following a young man named Stephen Dedalus, whom Bloom meets eventually, but Bloom is the main character.) It describes the things that transpire in the world around Bloom, as well as the thoughts that go on inside his head.Ulysses contains many disparate literary styles, but none are gratuitous; all are used in the service of the novel's themes. Joyce wanted to show how poetry, history, heroism, romanticism, and indeed all of human civilization, can be found slumbering in each individual, no matter how mundane his life might be. This comes to the fore in chapter 14, in which Bloom goes to a maternity ward to convey his best wishes to a woman in labour. When he arrives, he meets a bunch of drunk medical students who make callous remarks that make him uncomfortable; after some time, the nurse comes in and announces that the woman successfully gave birth, which relieves Bloom's anxiety. In addition to these simple events, the chapter tells the entire history of England. That is, the first paragraph is written in monosyllabic Druidic calls, the second approximates the style of ancient Latin historians, the third glides into early Anglo-Saxon poetry (\\"before born babe bliss had\\"), then it switches to Chaucer and medieval prose, and so on, the style of each paragraph moving a little bit forward in history, until it collapses into a mix of modern slang in the end.Thus, in numerous prose styles, the chapter recreates the birth and life of the English language itself, without warning the reader that it's doing this. In essence, it shows the history of a whole civilization in an original way. But the important part is, it never stops making sense; the plot and the dialogue keep progressing along with the style. Thus, the birth of a child is shown alongside the birth of the whole English language, indicating that civilization is born anew with every new human being. An ordinary birth is made to look like the culmination of all of English history, thanks entirely to this method of describing it. You don't have to have read Chaucer and Shakespeare and Gibbon to appreciate this chapter; Joyce read them for you, so all you have to do is watch the language change.This happens all the time throughout the book. For instance, chapter 13 finds Bloom wandering around on a beach, where some teenage girls are hanging out and talking. Without further ado, the book inserts itself into the mind of one of these girls. Her thoughts aren't anything amazing: basically, she just wants to fall in love with a handsome man, be loved in return, and be happy. However, in describing these thoughts, Joyce adopts the style of a dime-store romantic novel of the sort that are marketed to teenage girls: it's rife with sentimental, flowery prose like \\"the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.\\" The thing is, this style accurately reflects what folks go through during their teenage years: it's got the same heightened emotion, the same vague yearning, the same feeling one gets when falling in love for the first time, that this has never before happened to anyone else and will never happen again, the same romanticism and idealism. Thus, it's remarkably easy to sympathize with the girl, again solely due to Joyce's technique.That's probably the biggest reason to read Ulysses: all these styles and epic analogies are founded on a powerful emotional centre. Some folks like to say that this book is a \\"celebration of life,\\" or something to that effect. Well, in my opinion, it's a book about loneliness more than anything else. A large part of the book consists of Bloom's internal monologues, creating the impression that he's constantly hounded by unwelcome thoughts. When he's not running into hostile nationalists or petty gossips, he thinks about his adulterous wife. Then, in chapter 14, he meets Stephen Dedalus, decides to follow him out of the maternity ward and into the red light district, and then brings him home. Bloom, whose own son died eleven days after being born, feels fatherly affection toward Stephen; yet, Bloom and Stephen have nothing to say to each other. They engage in some small talk, but Stephen clearly doesn't take Bloom seriously, and Bloom doesn't really know how to approach Stephen. Then, Stephen, who is the closest thing to a friend that Bloom has met all day, leaves. Bloom goes upstairs and goes to sleep next to his wife; the final chapter is told from his wife's point of view, and it becomes abundantly obvious that her perception of her own husband is often wrong, and always strangely detached, as if he's not close to her at all despite living under the same roof. The style is breathtaking, rhythmic stream-of-consciousness, highlighting the sadness of this emotional distance between the characters.So, don't feel threatened by the style. Ulysses is very readable; true, each chapter has its own style, but most of the styles are perfectly accessible, and make the plot more engaging. All the \\"difficult\\" parts don't happen until the second half, giving you time to get accustomed to Joyce's idiosyncrasies (he doesn't tell you when he's moving from objective description to internal monologue, but after a while, you can usually tell). Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought this to supplement the 1961 Random House edition (balance of textual corrections and respect for the original, matches most annotations), Modern Library edition (most portable, attractive package as all ML editions, typography a tad hard on my 40-something eyes) and '80s \\"Gabler edition\\" (hotly contested, worth keeping as a collector's item as it's been largely withdrawn).The original Shakespeare & Co. printings are out of my league, although I've seen several. Until I hit the lottery, this is the closest I'll own. A quick Google will find you first edition, first printing copies selling for up to 100k. I doubt my stimulus check is that big.This is a textual facsimile - a photo reproduction of the original, 1000-copy first edition - copy #784, to be exact. It also reproduces the cover typography and the Shakespeare and Co. title page, with an added, Orchises title page to keep the record clear. It contains the original colophon. It doesn't contain the forward, letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf or Judge Woolsey opinion you're probably used to seeing in American editions.In a physical sense, it's hard to say how this is a facsimile, other than Orchises has reproduced the full size of the original. Of course, the paper and binding material are different.Most S. & Co. editions came unbound in blue-green wrappers, and could be bound as desired. This is why you see original printings in such disparate bindings. Orchises has reproduced the color of the original wrappers, although their binding looks a little more green than the original wrappers (maybe the color has shifted on those?). In any case, it's a solid cloth binding, comparable to, say, a better-than-average library binding. Bound size given as 9.6 x 7.5 x 1.7 inches, I measure it a hair taller. I daresay it will hold up to extended use.In addition to giving the slight tingle of pleasure that comes from knowing you're reading the text as originally sold at 12, Rue de l'Odeon, this edition is much more comfortable on my eyes than the others. I like the typeface used by original printer Maurice Darantiere for readability, but haven't gotten a definitive answer as to what it is - does anyone know? Somehow, it just feels right.Orchises says the paper is 50-pound, ph-balanced (aka acid-free) paper, and that seems about right. It's really good paper, with a slight, almost visually undetectable textured finish that feels good to the fingers. Excellent paper-to-ink contrast. I can, and will, read this all day.For the average reader, there's no earthly reason to spend this amount on a novel, and the ML edition will be both more convenient and, with its front material, more informative. For someone who rereads Ulysses for pleasure, it's a joy. The 1922 text has been analyzed to death, and is not without errors (2,000? 3,000? 5,000? the number gets larger each time it's mentioned). It was perhaps inevitable in a book with no clear reference manuscript - even the extant manuscripts were to some degree created by Joyce after the fact for sale. Part of one manuscript was burned by the angry husband of a typist, who found its content objectionable. An appreciable percentage of the text was written as corrections on the original proofs.Hence the charming apology from Sylvia Beach reproduced in this facsimile: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances. S.B.\\"But each effort to correct the errors added more errors, as well as layers of contention. See the well-documented battle over the Gabler edition. Or the disastrous 1998 \\"Reader's edition\\" by Danis Rose. The original is as good as any for reading, and if you care enough to buy a facsimile, you will have other editions for comparison anyway.For scholarly use, this isn't the best edition, since most standard annotations match the Random House or Modern Library editions. Unless you're beyond Ulysses 101 and want to compare editions.This is one of three first-edition facsimiles that have been published. I can't speak to the others, but I can recommend this one. Kudos to Orchises, and I hope they keep it in print. Or not, so my copy will become a minor-league collector's item.Ulysses has become an obsession and and a world in and of itself for its partisans, of whom I am one. The Ulysses obsession is much like the Higher Criticism surrounding the Sherlock Holmes canon. Many people find it bizarre, and I can hardly disagree. If, like me, you've got the bug, I don't have to explain it to you. This is an edition for you.If you don't, I paraphrase Louis Armstrong: \\"If you have to ask, you'll never know.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let's not mince words: Ulysses is one of the highest achievements of literary modernism. But it is also a book that must be read again and again (and again) if it is to be understood and enjoyed. Why buy a pulpy and cheaply made edition that falls to pieces on the second read? The Orchises edition, as a physical artefact, is not only aesthetically worthy of the text it presents (including the generous white space framing the text itself)--it also has the durability and weight you'd normally expect from a Bible.Other reviewers have detailed how this book is a faithful facsimile of the 1922 editions. The only other thing I would add is that this is the edition whose colour scheme Joyce himself oversaw: The white text and blue background of the cover symbolise the pentelic marble of Greece and the greenblue of the Mediterranean respectively (which are also the colours of the Greek flag).I thoroughly recommend this beautiful book for anyone who is serious about Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"June 16th, 1904 in Dublin - a city under British rule and starting to try and shrug off the weight of the colonial oppression. On this day Joyce sets his &quot;heroes&quot; (heroes that only Joyce could create), Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) and Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus), on their own odysseys through Dublin's streets. Along the way we get a catalog of minor disappointments and victories, major literary experiments and a reading experience to truly last a lifeline.Stephen Dedalus, the hero from Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, is the young student, the educated, literary and artistic individual somewhat based on Joyce himself. Leopold Bloom is the older, cynical 20th century everyman, in search of a son (where Stephen is, to some extents, missing a father). They make their individual journeys around Dublin that day, finally coming together in a chance meeting and then becoming friends.If you are after a riveting story, you won't find it here - the previous paragraph somes it up! What we get is to walk in these (and other people's) shoes for a day. We experience their small successes - an idle flirtation perhaps; we are with them as they realize some minor disappointment. Joyce termed these experiences ephiphanies and, to some extent, that's what Ulysses is - many, many iter-related and multi-layered ephiphanies.We also feel part of Dublin the city and Ireland the country. It's difficult looking back now after 80 years of home rule, with its successes and failures, what it must have looked like then unsure of what the future would bring. Joyce gives us a divided picture - we see the &quot;citizen&quot;, the nationalistic and stubborn individual who desires freedom at any cost; we see those who are staunchly royalist and who support (flirt with in the case of some of the women) the British soldiers. Joyce's picture is no one-dimensioned protestant-Catholic division either. This element of the book has great interest in it's own right.Ulysses has parallels from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The correspondence from chapter to chapter is highly selective. Some chapters use purely literary techniques to make a parallel (in particular &quot;The Sirens&quot;) where others have more pointed comparisons. You do not need to be familiar with The Odyssey to get something out of this book. Familiarity with Joyce's earlier works - Dubliners and Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man - is very useful, as is an understanding of Shakespeare's Hamlet. References to all of these abound.What you will probably also need is a guide. I used Harry Blamires's &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot; and I would seriously recommend using it or something similar on a first reading. Joyce's writing in this book is wonderful but it can be very very difficult. Having someone hold your hand on the journey helps you get much more out of it.The style of writing changes throughout the book; Joyce was experimenting with literary techniques to help tell the tale and give us insight into his character. Some of these are very successful - some are rather inpenetrable. In particular the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter is very hard-going in parts!However, unlike some other literary works, Ulysses is always fun. You might find you get the most out of some of it if you read it aloud (or imagine yourself doing so) because much of the work is highly poetical. For the final chapter - the only one told from a female perspective - the heavy stream of consciousness deserves to be read in a gallop, letting the words flow over you.Joyce wrote this seminal work over a period of seven years and, at times, it felt it would take me that long to finish it. It's certainly not something to embark upon if you won't be able to devote considerable time to it. With so many great books to be read, you may wonder why you should devote this amount of time and energy on a single book. In this case the answer is because it is a unique, wonderful and life-enhancing experience."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Easily the most exciting book ever written. I'd give it 6 stars (or 10) if i could. Yes, i needed the Cliff notes to help me through it, and yes, i was on disability at the time, recovering from 4 knee surgeries, and it took more than 6 weeks, but it was all worth it. It's an amazing thing, a polyglotting amalgamation of languages (i counted more than 30, and am sure i missed a lot more), internal and external dialogue, brilliantly rendered characters and even dirty jokes.Perhaps i was ignorant beforehand, but i'd always thought that &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; referred to only the WRITER'S mental wanderings, the way beats like William Burroughs (e.g., Naked Lunch) and Allen Ginsburg (Howl, America, etc.) would later do it, or Marcel Proust (a\` la recherche du temps perdu--let's face it, the translations just don't cut it) during Joyce's time. But Joyce, progenitor of the beats and contemporary of Proust, did it for DIFFERENT PEOPLES' CONSCIOUSNESSES, moving from spoken word to internal thought states of several of his vividly drawn characters, and back again. It's almost impossible to convey the wonder of discovering this beauty, the way Joyce represented such a quantum leap in literature from Dostoyevsky, Dickens and Kafka before him, as Einstein did from 19th century physics.And to those who say &quot;anyone who says they've [sic] read this book is a liar,&quot; i promise you i read EVERY WORD, from &quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan&quot; to &quot;Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun&quot; to &quot;and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes I will Yes,&quot; the final words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy. And &quot;Frisco Beach&quot; too. (I'm NOT an English literature professor, just a physician--please don't hold that against me!)Challenging? yes. Worth it? oh my, yes. Your eyes (and &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;) will be opened forever, never to approach writing the same way. WOW!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man \\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Imaginative literature can't afford to dissociate itself from its readership because the &quot;lay-reader&quot; is the very rationale for its existence! Joyce is not a model to be followed by any writer. Granted that it is the reader's prerogative to choose and pick - it is not up to the author of imaginative literature to be selective about his readers. This extremely gifted man had set out to surpass everything produced in literature up to his time, and if his goal had been tedium to the max, he achieved it. I am the first to give Joyce due credit for the linguistic scope and the skill with which he engineered the plot in Ulysses - but answer me honestly: does any of the characters come to live the way - say - Tolstoy manages to animate his people with a much more primitive technique? I seriously doubt it. Joyce the human being had limitations which got in the way of Joyce the writer which prevented Joyce the artist from living up to the full potential of Joyce the talent. Style is a direct reflection of an artist's temperament - obviously the writer of &quot;Ulysses&quot; could never make up his mind what kind of style it is going to be - the book lacks unity and appears in places unnecessarily oracular due to the style, but not necessarily for the subject matter, which can be looked up in a good reference! And if that wouldn't be bad enough, more than once Joyce went off on a rather revealing tangent: take for instance the masturbation scene in &Ograve;Nausicaa.&Oacute; Superbly written as it is, it gives us the whole deficiency of Joyce in a nutshell. He imitates the presumptuous and pompous phrasing in certain fashion magazines of the period, but just tell me to what end? Is it to poke fun on the cliche beset thought-process of the crippled girl? Well I fail to see the joke, this is just cruel. Satire either attacks a subject that has the capacity to bite back, or it is merely an act of a certain and in Joyces time very fashionable &quot;anti-philistine&quot; snobbery. Or perhaps the only reason for writing this way was that Mr. Joyce wished to flaunt his stylistic versatility? I am not objecting to have readers making an effort to get into a difficult text - not at all. But the reward should offer better things than the gratification of a crossword puzzle. We talk about participation. Participation in the artist's temperament to see things the way they present themselves to the artist. This does not prevent us from disagreeing. (I disagree with many things Tolstoy had to say when he couldnt resist to step on his collapsible soap box. But I also appreciate his artistic genius whenever he spares us the lecture.) To give another example: Compare &Ograve;Oxen of the Sun&Oacute; in Ulysses with the moments when women break their water in Tolstoys novels. Giving birth is not a linguistic exercise. Joyce's choice of style (in fact a display of 60 different styles and modes of speech) is just clever but completely detached from the event. What is to be expected at the very least, is a certain coherence of artistic vision, which I find utterly lacking in Joyce. He can't make up his mind, so he throws at us all the imitative bits and pieces from a (very talented) schoolboy's exercise book. Ulysses is the portfolio of a writer's versatility - it is not a work of art. When I was much younger and naive, I had read every single line of Joyce, including his letters and poems and even Finnegan's Wake (what a waste of time). I can't help it, the man was an amateur for all his life, a typical tinkerer and home improvement guy who probably never really found the kind of subject matter that could have distracted him from his self-consciousness. His short stories wouldn't be barely remembered these days if there wasnt his name under the title. They are imitation pieces, ventriloquistic exercises, and pretty flat and lifeless if held against Chekhov and Kipling, or Flaubert and Kathleen Mansfield. Apparently &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot; and especially &Ograve;Ulysses&Oacute; were written by an author who went on a quest for his own style. If Finnegan's Wake eventually was the place where the eagle landed, then, I am sorry to say, the game wasn't worth the candles. Joyce had tons of talent to burn, but something went seriously wrong here. I am all for modern art, and consider &quot;post modern&quot; a phony contradiction in terms. But lesser talents accomplished more - DosPassos, O'Neil, Kafka, Proust, Marianne Moore, Auden, Hemingway, Nabokov, they all have their moments, even clowns like Bukowski and Douglas Adams (who is a linguistic genius in his own right.) Borges could put in 3 lines what took a Joyce 30 strenuous pages without ever achieving a comparable impact. In the end, all I ask for, is the readers honesty. Don't just think something is great because a certain establishment says so. Real great artists (like Dickens or Shakespeare) can do without this sort of approval. Don't make it a mission to reach for an icon for no other reason than seeing it hanging high. A failure is a failure even if it is a great man's failure. And Joyce wasn't made of the stuff of greatness. But this is a different story. Approaching Joyce is an experience not unsimilar to &Ograve;The Approach to Al-Mutasim.&Oacute;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great.

Joyce, Faulkner (in some cases), and others of the &quot;I'm too deep for you, dummy&quot; school have massive good press from academics.

I hate Stephen Dedalus. I hate Leopold Bloom. I hate Molly Bloom. I even hate their cat. They're all fatuous and arrogant and dull and dishonest and insecure and insincere and superficial and greedy, and they all take part in a story that's a boring, tedious, frustrating, incoherent, big fat waste of my time and energy. Anyone who claims otherwise is either a massive liar or a sick masochist who deserves to have a bag slipped over their head and be taken away from society. As such it remains one of the most astoundingly honest and ambitious works in modern literature. There is not a book currently existing which is simultaneously as repelling and compelling. Is there a more divisive stirrer of passionate debate in the field of art? Normally a very relaxed, some may say apathetic and pacifistic, individual, I once heard my English teacher saying that Ulysses was nothing but complete garbage. I calmly stood up and punched him in the throat, and I received polite applause as I was escorted from the classroom. Later on, when I reread a section of Ulysses near the middle, I discovered that he was completely right. But you know what? That's life. And that sense of living pours off Joyce's pages and through his eccentric mouldings of the English language like a waterfall. It's almost too much to bear at times. We eat, we drink, we urinate, we defecate, we sneeze, we fart, we stink and we have sex, and after a few decades we die. No hidden wisdom. No great awakening. No grand nobility. No spiritual nirvana. That's LIFE. And the sooner you come to terms with that, the more depressed you'll be. Wonderfully, wonderfully depressed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To understand something of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; one must firstlook at its publication in a historical perspective. Brought out inprint in a time when the banning of books was common practice in the war against &quot;obscenity,&quot; Mr. Joyce's work was championed by all liberals everywhere--not so much on its artistic merits, but, rather, due to what it symbolized for them: The struggle of the artist against the State. As for the book itself,the writing was almost secondary. In fact, it was not just derided by philistines; many noteworthy authors--among whom number Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein--questioned its originality and its effectiveness. (For certainly, most of its now-thought &quot;original techniques&quot; had been used before by other writers to far better effect!) That is to say, &quot;Ulysses&quot; became more important for what it was SUPPOSED to represent than for what it actually was. As time passed and young people of a more liberal turn acceded to positions of social authority, &quot;Ulysses&quot; began to be, almost defiantly, hyped as a modernist masterpiece. This, of course, to tweek the nose of the older generation more than to herald a legitimate work of Art. As a result, whole generations of subsequent Americans have had imposed on them the the ready-made opinion that &quot;Ulysses&quot; holds an unassaible position in the Letters of the World; for, certainly, they fear to have attached to themselves the tag &quot;Vulgarian&quot; if they dare to express their own thoughts on this grossly over-rated book. No, truly, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a triumph of propoganda that, when taken out of its historical context and judged squarely, falls flat, resuming its true proportions on an artistic level given it by great writers of the time: A dry, pedantic and boring farrago."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I feel myself quite inadequate to write even a small review on such a masterpiece. This is a book of astonishing beauty and remarkable insight. I do believe it well worth the time and effort. The last few lines are truly the most extraordinay I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I know that I'm being sacrilegious here (especially considering that I live in Dublin, and Joyce is our Patron Saint of Literature and Literary Pub Tours), but how this novel is always ranked among the top of the 'Greatest of the Greatest' lists totally escapes me. I personally don't think that Joyce can lay claim to writing a true literary masterpiece simply because the language is immensely challenging. I strongly suspect that the accolades come in part precisely because of the fact that Ulysses rises far above the language of the less-intellectual novels that grace today's best-seller lists, and there is only a certain breed of reader that will wrestle with such a monster and live to tell about it. Not to down-play the other reviews here (which I think are all valid), but this veneration of Joyce seems to have a slight odor of literary snobishness. I can think of many more modern classics that are written with such clarity that even the less 'intellectual' can grasp the depth of the work...and isn't that truly the hallmark of a premiere author?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Masterly done. One of the greatest novels I have ever read. James Joyce always hides another story, an image that passes us during the first read, that envokes us to read the novel a second time. And as soon as we pick the book up again, just when we thought we knew the allegory, another story surfaces itself from the pages. Stunning. An example of this two-sided method Joyce uses in his story is the first chapter. We see Stephen Dedalus shaving himself while he talks to his friend Buck Mulligan, but after a second read of the chapter we don't see Stephen Dedalus shaving but as a reciever of communion from Buck Mulligan who is actually a Protestant priest that consecrates the host at the beginning of the chapter. Only a master can put two stories in one chapter."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you want to understand Ulysses, you HAVE to read Portrait first, by JOyce of course. Try to get some portrait commentary so you know where Joyce is coming from, preferably an essay or two on JOyce's aesthetic theory and on the role of Stephen. If you can, read Dubliners too. I listened to an audio book lecture series on Joyce before i began his work ... it spoke of how the book begins in this oddly shaped tower the likeness of which can only be found in Ireland, hence, an American reader would most likely be ignorant as to where the books begins. As you read, consult the ANNOTATED ULYSSES for vocab and sentences that just seem too complex ... like the first sentence of the Bloom section and the ineluctable modality... - most people would not pick up the Jakob Boehme reference in the sentence, and when you do, if you dig Boehme as i have, let's just say it is a pleasant experience. I suggest the Everymna LIbrary series edition, it is a beautiful edition and has some very insightful supplements, including an introduction, the statement by an American judge that has become so renowned, a history of how the book has been printed(and more oft, destroyed) and a helpful chart on the structure of the book. I suggest one reads as much of this book as one can, even if it is just the Stehpen section, else one might die without at least experiencing part of this genius. Knowing a dash about Aquinas and Aristotle and reading some Berkeley will also sharpen one's mind to what's going on here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great writer. For first readers &quot;Dubliners&quot; and maybe &quot;A Portrait...&quot; are the best books to begin with. The later celebrated and larger books require help in the form of a companion or annotations (Burgess's books -ReJoyce-, and/or other Companions you can buy here at Amazon. In addition his life history is also important) to approach because the scene is a century ago and the references many.

What it is, certainly, is a work rooted in the depths of writing, a work labored over by a very intelligent man for years on end, and a work which deserves more thought than some are willing to give it credit for. The simple fact that a novel must be digested and thought about does not make it &quot;obscure,&quot; nor is it, &quot;worthless.&quot; It can be enjoyed by all who are willing to think about it. Writers like Carver who can demonstrate beauty in the simplicity of their writing have their place in the corpus of the English language, but so do writers like Joyce, whose complexities weave around themselves and ask us to consider the possibilities of our language in a different sense.

I think it must be the most difficult reading I ever made. Joyce built an entire new language of literature to write this remarkable novel, an original work in all aspects from tale to structure and language. People talk in many codes, from old rude Irish to Latin, Italian and common english. The description of inarticulate sounds like the cat's &quot;Mrkgnao&quot; was quite new to literature. The tale grasps to describe the everyday action of early century Dublin, a single day of the common life of some Irish villagers - every action, every thought and discussion, every joke, memory and dream! The story is about a man that represents the classic hero inside of the common man. Heroic deeds aren't done only in the bloody fields of senseless wars; the common man does great deeds every day without bloodshed. Remember that Ulysses was a a hero that hated war. Joyce believed that modern literature was empty within its meaningless structures and tales; only the profound significance of the classics could inject human soul back to literature. Joyce believed that people were always unconsciously reliving the classics models in their lifes, like a circle that never ends. Finally, the structure is made of many styles in order to create an entire new genre of modern literature. Think of something and you find it in &quot;Ulysses&quot;: popular songs, discussions, theatre, oniric events, medieval tales, monologues, mind narrative... &quot;Ulysses&quot; has what it takes to stand among the greatest works of mankind's literature. Scholars say that Joyce wrote &quot;Ulysses&quot; as the book that would end with all books, the final stone of modern literature in its way to regain the soul of the classics. They may be right! &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a small world written into book.

A person may imagine that writings of this sort confer a measure of immortality. The measure of immortality gleaned by such articles, however, is rather small. What do people learn about us other than that we have some small part in sorting out a minor detail of the workings of the universe? We are no more than a couple initials followed by a family name that appear above the abstract. In contrast, the degree of immortality gained by an author such as James Joyce in the writing of Ulysses is immeasurably greater. Infused into his character Leopold Bloom are the important details of a day of a life. From his morning ablutions to his final repose, marked by the famous soliloquy of his wayward wife Molly, Leopold reveals to us the broad spectrum of what every rich life might be expected to encompass. From birth to death, from the stirrings of love to betrayals both great and small, Joyce's protagonist experiences them all as his moves through the day--and through reflections on his life from the vantage point afforded by middle age.To help bring this book to life I urge the reader to look up Molly Bloom's soliloquy as performed by Angeline Ball."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is a great facsimile of the first edition.

The flipside of this theme is that human beings don't treat each other like family; rather, we treat each other like dirt.The unity theme in Joyce inspired Joseph Campbell, the great comparative mythologist.The Gabler edition is superior if only for the preface where the simple theme of love is discussed.This book, as the professor I had told the class I was in, will change you.

I really enjoyed the simultaneous casting of the characters as social constructions and as owners of free will.

This tale of the adventures of advertising salesman Leopold Bloom on June 16, 1904, in Dublin is a remarkable conflation of mythology, symbolism, philosophy, social realism, and humanity. Bloom's relationships with wife Molly and surrogate son Stephan Dedalus reflect the simple decency of the common man. There is no doubt that reading Ulysses places great demands on the intellect of the reader. Joyce's intentions in writing Ulysses, to present a totally realistic view of one day in the life of ordinary Dublin citizens, yet at the same time to weave into this a grand parallel with Homer's Odyssey and on a smaller scale to deal with issues as complicated as those of Irish politics and religion, mean that before they come upon the novel, it is necessary for the reader to have a wide base of knowledge. The act of interpretation becomes not a burden but an essential part of the act of reading Ulysses for without it the reader might not gain the sense that they are one of the people that the novel is addressed to, rather than just an observer of a finite experience..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First of all, I won't even begin to say what this giant hulk of a book was about, but it still remains my favorite work of literature of all time.

It is like Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon in that, there's so much knowledge stuffed into the narrative you'll never be able to grasp every word... And that's okay. You don't have to. It would probably take you decades anyhow. Just sit back and take your time with this one and somehow, it will become clear to you, the same time it's confusing the hell out of you.

Academic infighting notwithstanding, I think the Gabler edition is as close to a &quot;correct&quot; Ulysses as we're going to get. The work he has put into studying each word is really astounding, and he's cleaned up a lot of sentences that never made sense earlier (I'm sure plenty of graduate students wrote long papers on how brilliant those nonsensical fragments were), and restored several sections that make it a much richer read - the telegram to Stephen, especially, opened up a lot of things for me.The book itself can get infuriating if one doesn't read it with a guide. Reading it beside the Bloomsday book allowed me to enjoy it the first time I went through it; if I hadn't done that, I doubt I would have enjoyed it much at all. It occasionally seems like he is just throwing in a different gimmick each chapter just to make it opaque - Oxen of the Sun, especially, just annoyed the hell out of me.But there are moments in this book that are unequalled by any other writer in English, and everyone should at least read it once - no matter how many people have ripped Joyce off, no one can get his style just right. Honestly, it is difficult to love this book as much as one might love Portrait, or even Dubliners, but there are moments of great compassion and insight here - you just have to cut through some of his tricks first. And the tricks usually aren't without purpose - most of them do need to be there. I find myself flipping through the book and reading some of the chapters again and again - the first two, Hades, Nausicaa, Circe, and Penelope, especially - and they're rewarding no matter how many times I read them. Beat through the whole book. And get this edition. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've always laughed at X-Files fans, but I'm beginning to suspect a conspiracy. For years now, all I've ever heard is 'Ulysses' is unreadable, obtuse, unwieldly. It is anything but, being outrageously funny, unstoppably readable, dementedly inventive. Why would 'they' want us not to read it? Although it has saturated modern culture, Joyce's frightening lessons have been ignored or emasculated - film, literature, art, music are as timid and cliched today as they ever were, as if 'Ulysses' had never existed. 'Ulysses' demands that we think for ourselves, it bursts with inchoate possibilities we must take up for ourselves. Of course we shouldn't read it. But you really must get this edition (Oxford World Classics, edited by Jeri Johnson). go to 'Ulysses' bald, as I have done so many times, and you will probably throw it down after three pages, frustrated, annoyed, anchorless in a river of unfamiliar words, ideas, style. Johnson's annotation here is scrupulous. For each chapter, she registers the Homeric paralells, she discusses the various schema (each chapter has its own colour, art (eg literature, medicine), body organ etc.), she offers a brief critical precis of what is going on. Her notes, explaining historical literary, popular etc. allusions, are indispensible. With the exception of the (mercifully few) Stephen Daedalus chapters, as dense and (generally) dull as their hero, the book is a joyous breeze (well, almost). This in itself is a betrayal of Joyce - we are supposed to be jolted, confused, lost, such is the nature of modern life Joyce wanted us to taste. But he provided all his friends with clues, and we're just as good as them, right? There's no point talking about the discrete ingenuity of each episode, the depth of character, the unheard-of realism in describing their emotional and intellectual lives, the satire, the comedy, the seething anger at authoritarianism, communal idiocy and intellectual myopia, the parodies and pastiches of all literature and other cultural products. Like all great post-modern works (and like Godard, Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce is a fertile POST-modernist, not a strangulated modernist), it will be impossible to read previous literature in the same way before, while it makes almost everything that came after it seem diluted and half-hearted. Leopold Bloom has been called a bourgeois everyman, but if only he was. His kindness, his (however unmethodical) voracious curiosity, his self-awareness, his humour, are as unusual in 1904 Dublin, as they are in our racist, money-mad, mean-minded, self-obsessed, greasy-tilled society today (I mean Ireland of course). My favourite episode is 'Sirens', the ultimate fusion of everything that is 'Ulysses' - character, language, humour, style, parody, satire, anger, emotion. Life. Now for the Wake!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What a read! Stephen Dedalus's pretentious aestheticism reminded me a lot of Thomas Mann's Death of Venice's character Gustav Aschenbach, without of course the cynical hatred of the rotten Europe, more the wide-eyed lover of the growing Dublin. Leopold Bloom on the other hand seems to be a man to my own naive (or ignorant) tastes. The poetic consumer of words versus the materialist producer of words, a unity of humanity seen through two (or maybe including Molly three) eyes. The allusions to Aristotle and Blake needed a regular flicking through literary notes and for the Proteus chapter even a German dictionary! This was no bad thing though for if anything Ulysses is an education. Like all good things it required work, but with some good notes of history and literature its a must read, as beautiful as the Lithy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is so bizarre it made my eyes itch.

Not merely because of the difficulty (I like long, 'difficult' books generally) but because it's a book that you've got to totally submerge yourself within. Once you get comfortable with the bizarre minutia of daily life in Dublin circa 1904, and with the way that Joyce will change register, tone, syntax and structure, often within the same sentence, it becomes a little more manageable. A little. Each section is deeply challenging, deeply strange. Just when you begin to get the tempo of one, it ends, and you sort of have to teach yourself how to read the next one all over again. It often wasn't clear to me where the mythic and mundane end and begin in this book, because they bleed into each other in different ways both structurally and thematically on almost each page. There are moments of real stylistic brilliance throughout the book (the incredible 'wandering rocks' section, the hallucinatory mythological hodge-podge of the 'cyclops' part), and there were even some parts where I was genuinely emotionally moved (the funeral scene, the final, love-affirming pages of Molly's monologue). That being said, Joyce is also an insufferable intellectual show-off. And while this might be his 'biggest' work, for my money, 'Dubliners' is still his best, because he's at his best when he makes you interested in his characters instead of being merely interested in his own intellect. It definitely helps a bit if you've read 'Portrait of the Artist' first, but you certainly don't have to. And don't bother with a reader's guide. It might help you get some of the references (and god, how this book references things), but it won't help you to actually read it.

A dead father, a dead mother populate the story along with sights, smells, but most of all noise-- songs and chants. There are ditties, rhymes, advertisements, sayings remembered, refrains, art songs, Baroque and classical music filling the pages of this book.There is a great send-up on newspapers and the misinformation embodied in them.

Obviously the book is complex. I would characterize it as the most difficult book I have ever read, whoever, I would not take this as an offence to the genius of the book. I have read (and performed) Hamlet, Homer, Dante, and a host of other &quot;classics,&quot; but even if you have not you can still appreciate this work. I would be lying if I said I understood all of the esoteric references even to the literature I have read, but lets be honest how many of us can say we havn't been stumped by a book, or movie, or story, or whatever even with references relativly close to our times and places. I know people who would have no clue if I made a reference to somthing like &quot;Fight Club&quot; even though it is both a best selling book and huge motion picture success (Lord of the Rings for that fact). Don't worry if somthing goes over your head. This is not a casual novel (no Koontz or King here). This is a thematic character study. I recently heard an interesting interview with Quentin Terrantino in which he said somthing to the effect of &quot;people don't talk about 'the plot' they talk about their everyday s**t,&quot; and actually that is a pretty fair description of what the framework for Ulysses is. It is one day in the lives of predominantly two people. We are all dynamic individuals, try to immagine a day in your own life and the stresses and desires you face. What memories creep into your concious. What little games do you play at work, with friends, your lover? I bet your not the same person in all those places are you? Don't sweat it if you don't understand a word here and there just take your time and be carefull with the text. The perspectives will shift and the stream of conciousness will kick in and you have to roll with the punches.It will probably help most people to have some reference books available during a reading of Ulysses, but I personnally felt I became too distracted with every little newance (that's probably spelled incorrectly) so I just went with it. There is a reason all the ivory tower types love this book and that is because you can literally spend years deciphering all the layers. The book, like all pieces of art, is a product of its time so be prepared for that as well. It helps to have some knowledge of turn of the twentieth century Irish/English relations, world views, even literary styles of the era. I had a duece of a time getting through the collected works of Poe because so much of it was in German, French, or Latin (you know people in America used to learn Latin in school, how lame ;) ). I have rambled for way to long so I will close with a point. Many people don't understand modern classical music because they don't understand its place in history. Many people don't understand Jazz or Punk or Hip Hop because they don't understand their places in history. Ultimatly Ulysses will be like many other works of art in this regard. Take your time with it and relax with it (you are not being graded on how many of the top 100 of whatever you have read you know). You may not really like it after having read it and thats OK, but don't be a close minded neigh-sayer just because its not your style. I don't really like Russian novels, but I see their quality, just as I see the genius of Pollack, Whorhal, and Basquiatt (probably missed at least one of those names) but would rather hang a Munch or Picasso. To each his own just don't be pretentious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In 2000, the Modern Library came up with a list of the one hundred greatest English language novels of the 20th century. Topping their list at number one was Ulysses, by Irish novelist James Joyce. After completion of this novel, I can conclude that they have made a wise decision.Ulysses follows the lives of two Dubliners, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, on a single day in Ireland. Leopold Bloom is a lonely middle-aged Jewish man who has a wife, Molly and a daughter, Milly. He also had a son that died as a child. Stephen Dedalus is a young school teacher who has seperated himself from his old drunken father. During the day, Stephen and Bloom make their seperate ways through the hectic streets and taverns of Dublin. Along the way the encounter various characters (such as the Citizen and the Anonymous Narrator) that act as symbols for Dublin society and the world in general. By the end of the novel, the theme has been understood. Like that of Homer's Odyssey (hence the name of the title), Leopold (Ulysses) has gained a son in Stephen (Telemachus), and Stephen has gained a father in him.Ulysses is undoubtedly Joyce's masterwork. He takes command of the English language, as well as nearly a dozen others, throughout the course of the novel. Various literary styles are exhibited to fit the theme of each chapter. For example, to show the busy workplace of a newspaper office, Joyce begins each section with a headline that sums it up. A complete five act drama is even included in a single chapter of this novel. Joyce's methods of characterization are also very obscure, yet brilliant. Characters are not characterized by their actions or by dialouge, but by their thoughts and fantasies. This allows the reader to see each character's hidden emotions and fears. These inner monolouges may be triggered by the smallest occurrence, then escalade into the meanings of life and death.I would only recommend Ulysses to an experienced reader with a lot of spare time. This novel is 783 pages long and takes roughly thirty to forty hours to read. Joyce's various writing styles, although genious, are very difficult to read. So, if you think that you can get past these obstacles, should you read Ulysses? There is a simple answer that you will only understand after completion of the novel: Yes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The lovely, talented Erica Jong confessed to having skipped large parts of this momentous work, yet told people it was her favorite book. Hemingway did it a similar injustice--Ulysses deserves to be read, reread, and studied as infinitum. Joyce devoted eight years of hard work to it, and nothing like its stream-of-consciousness narrative has been seen since. Scholars take note--Faulkner never read this book!Space prevents me from gushing the way I would like to, but look for the passage in which Stephen Dedalus and Poldy Bloom are getting blasted in Dublin as a baby is being born above them, and Joyce's language begins with the Angleish of Beowulf and travels through time, touching downe with Chaucer and Sir Thomas Browne, among others. In truth, it's hard to believe that a single living human being actually sat down and created this out of nothing; to my poetic heart, it has always seemed as sacred and immutable as the sea or its stars..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It has taken something like a month, but Ulysses is finally done. I have conquered one of the Literary Behemoths (with Moby Dick and Middlemarch often considered as the other 2 of the Great Big Scary 3).Many aspects of this book are very, very challenging, and in my opinion you may want a little exposure to Joyce (like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) before you attempt this book. The other thing I strongly suggest is the new book Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd. Kiberd is essentially THE Joycean and spells out important literary concepts for each chapter of Ulysses.There are so many things the book brings up, but my personal favorite discussion has been the balance between art and obscenity within the eyes of the law.I remember touring NYU when I was between junior and senior year of high school. Right there, in the middle of the Art Department main office, was a black and white photograph of a woman sitting on the toilet. I was shocked. She had a faraway look in her eyes, and she was clearly thinking about something else-- the grocery list, all the things she had to do, something overwhelming. I was... confused but mentally intrigued. I had never seen anyone on the toilet before, and it's not something I actively think about other people doing. Ulysses is a lot like that. Almost as soon as Leopold Bloom, the main character, is introduced, we see him on the toilet. It's not particularly gross or graphic, but it's a private moment and there the reader is-- hovering. The book spans the course of one day, June 16th, and we see Leopold do pretty much everything. He eats, farts, has lustful thoughts... sure, some of the lustful thoughts might be creepy out of context, but in the 700 pages of context given, the reader becomes aware that this persistent lust is mostly due to the fact that he and his wife don't get down to the hanky-panky very much since their infant son died ten years ago.Joyce shows every aspect of life in such away that the reader realizes exactly what it it to be a human, full of conflict, obsessive thoughts and bodily needs (that goes back to the eating and farting). Just be prepared, because you have to find that beauty among a load of experimental styles and prose that can get very heavy at times."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ignoring the fact that I've had it a year and only made it to page 100...the format of the book is a bit odd. It's quite a large book, and the organization of the text on the page is very overwhelming. It's like a big, poorly published textbook. Perhaps this is what Joyce wanted..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce's 'Ulysses' is a huge book, a leviathan undertaking that could take a working person six months to finish. Here, with the expert and loving attention of Donal Donnelly is outstanding, and it gives this tome the respect it certainly deserves. It's worth your money and your time, and for the 43 hours you'll invest in listening to it your come away wiser and certainly more appreciative of one of the world's finest writers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All Joyce fans know about the strange history of the publication of Ulysses. This copy is a good size, fits in a bag easily, and is easy to carry. Some editions of U have a table of contents with the Greek parallels noted--did Joyce do this at some point? Anyhow, there is no table of contents (which it typical for most editions). This makes it difficult to study, esp. to link it with annotations. I find myself going from text to text trying to find my place in U and the annotations (I use Don Gifford's text). If you aren't willing to put in the time to study the text, I would suggest a text with a table of contents, if you know U and/or like the game of the book, I would highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you've ever wanted to join the intrepid few to have done \\"Ulysses\\" from cover to cover - but have found the task too forbidding - then this is probably the easiest and most palatable way of accomplishing your wish. The two narrators bring the work to life in a way that the printed work can only hint at; with the aid of their command of a dizzying variety of languages, accents, and dialects, you grasp (fairly often at least) what the flat-looking verbiage of the text only intermittently suggests.There are, however, inherent problems with a spoken-word reading of this work. The flitting from thought to thought that characterizes much of the text is slowed down and made too deliberate. The stream of consciousness is slowed to a trickle. Eighteen hours is stretched out to forty two in this reading and the sensation of a flurry of impressions that an ideal inner reading might capture (in Heaven?) is missing. In practice, however, only somebody utterly familiar with all the recondite allusions of the text could possibly read it so rapidly and you will probably get through the work more quickly by hearing this version than by reading it silently.I thought the \\"Circe\\" episode was the most compromised in this reading. It seems to go on for ever with the narrator having to announce the identity of the speaker every couple of sentences and the sense of whirling delirium goes missing because it drags so much. I don't know if this problem can be solved but I wonder if an ensemble of voices in this episode might more closely capture its atmosphere. Another gripe is that Donal Donnelly has a tuneless singing voice and the many musical snatches lose their point as a result. Joyce was highly musical but you'd never know it from this audiobook.But I moan too much. \\"Ulysses\\" is highly problematic - I would say self-contradictory - and I can't imagine any version in any medium could possibly elucidate it completely. This version comes relatively close to giving it point and for that I'm grateful. I've finally \\"done\\" Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since there is virtually no info about this book on this page, here is a brief description. This is a facsimile of the Shakespeare and Company 1922 edition of James Joyce's Ulysses. It is hardcover, and bound in cream-colored cloth. The book was published by Ann Arbor Media Group in 2005. The only other facsimile of the first edition (at least, that I found here at Amazon) costs considerably more. Basically, this is a cheaper option if you want the facsimile. The book is attractive and the text is nice and clear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is said that \\"Ulysses\\" is one of those books no one has ever read. Certainly, simply sitting down and trying to read it cold turkey is much too daunting for anyone who is not a literary scholar (and even some of those, too).The way I did it was to listen to these wonderful CDs while following along word-for-word in the Gabler Edition, published by Vintage, which is the version used by Irish actors Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie. (Purists may cavil that this is not the approved edition, but it's one that matches the audiobook.) The reading is very clear and understandable to non-Irish listeners, and journeys through Gaelic, Latin, French, and even a bit of cat language, if I heard right.Yes, indeed -- one chapter every day or two, followed by an analysis by a professor from one of those CD/DVD college lecture series, and I not only finished the thing but understood it rather well, enjoyed it immensely, gave it as a birthday present to a friend, and now plan to take a second run-through.I must caution that the book and the audio should be used together, or the reader will get lost in the stream-of-consciousness writing that seems almost schizophrenic. In other words, it's not to be listened to in the gym while jogging on the treadmill (I found that out pretty quickly)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim Norton, the actor reading this rendition, is fabulous in all his characters.

But it's worth it!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To read Joyce's ULYSSES takes the preparation and dedication of a scholar, but the rewards in successfully completing the challenge of this masterpiece are immeasurable , in not only experiencing Joyce's prose genius, but also in the sense of personal triumph which accompanies it. If reading this tome while flying, don't be surprised if an attendant comments on your \\"light reading\\". A summer novel for the beach, it ain't. Start preparation with a visit or revisit to Homer's ODYSSEY which forms the circuitous modern adventures of Leopold Bloom in this one-day Dublin \\"odyssey\\" paralleling Homer's hero Odysseus. There are many excellent critical treatments of ULYSSES, which are recommended as guides once the ODYSSEY episodes have been (re)familiarized. These critical guides are not in the nature of the high school/college crib sheets CLIFF'S NOTES, which are to be avoided as the plague, but are scholarly treatments linking the classical approaches with those of Joyce's Bloom. One is advised to read one chapter of Joyce first, consider what was read and how it connects to characters and actions in Homer. If foggy, or puzzling, the treatment of this chapter in the critical treatment should be visited. Then the Joyce chapter should be reread and contemplated. So, on to the next chapter. Sounds challenging and time consuming? Yes , but what a reward awaits those who persevere. Understanding and the layered richness of Joyce will unfold. And then, you are off on the ride of your life. Enjoy. One might also rent the movie O,BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? after the ODYSSEY refresher since it presents a Hollywood comic approach to Odysseus' adventures.

Although I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the different passages, there are still many that are incomprehensible. I have only scratched the surface of this magnificent work. The book, based on the Odyssey, follows a day in the life of the ordinary/extraordinary Leopold Bloom as he wanders through Dublin. There are many historical and literary descriptions and allusions that make that day come alive. Many of the supporting characters, especially Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom, are fully realized. The final stream of consciousness passage ends with what I think is a triumphant line.If you want to tackle this book, take your time and think."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The electronification of James Joyce's Ulysses hasn't quite got it yet: this Kindle edition is full of typos and odd punctuation. If you're planning on reading Joyce, you'd be better off with the hard copies for now; with maybe a free e-edition on your Kindle to supplement it, for those times when you're standing in line at the grocery store and can't be bothered to carry around 2 pounds of excellent literary deadweight."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those books that's a classic for good reason. Unfortunately, as we're taking James Joyce, it's a difficult read what with his traditional flair for making the English language do some incredible gymnastics coupled with obscure references.

It's kind of amateur."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Forget everything you've ever heard about Ulysses. Some people love it, some people hate it.I found that once you get into the flow of reading it, Joyce has a way of representing thought that feels more like you're thinking than reading something. That's what they mean by stream-of-consciousness. Sure, it's old. Sure, it's dense. You probably won't understand every single sentence or word in this epic, but try it. You might like it. It's a fun - yes, fun - book. Joyce jokes around. He is witty, unique, and yes, nonsensical.I loved this book. Not everyone will, but drop your fears and read it. Its difficulty is overhyped. You'll never finish it if you don't start it. It's definitely one of the more rewarding books I've read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a daunting and difficult prospect, contemplating the reading of ULYSSES. Much like Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, this is a book more quoted than read. It comes freighted with the most serious of professorial endorsements and a reputation for \`difficulty' hardly belied by its length.Does it justify its reputation as difficult? Yes. Does that hamper one's enjoyment reading it? Hardly at all. Jonathan Franzen's intervention in a debate about the differences between obtuse and clear writing is hardly helpful when considering ULYSSES. There should be a place for the products of literature, as for any art form, which requires the active participation of a reader, without succumbing to the charge of \`elitism'. Most great writers teach their readers how to read. The same applies to Joyce and ULYSSES (does the same apply to FINNEGAN'S WAKE? I don't know. I'm too scared to read it ...).My advice to any would-be reader - don't be intimidated by this book's reputation. Don't worry if at points, you find yourself confused or lost. Yes, there's a chapter in which Joyce recapitulates the evolution of written English to mirror embryonic development in humans. And yes, the chapter commonly known as \`Circe' is a bit long-winded. Despite that, the novel is a joy to read and to spend time with. Joyce's concerns in writing one day in the life of Leopold Bloom are life-fulfilling. There is tremendous joy, wit, fun and compassion in his portrayal of this most (un?)usual of heroes. It may help to avail yourself of the many resources available on the web. I found a lengthy pr&eacute;cis of each chapter particularly helpful at the start of my journey; and found that, about half-way through the book, I didn't need it any more. It is true that Joyce relied on allusions and references that are now all-but-lost to any modern reader. Again, don't worry. Any annotated edition will carry you through; and/or you'll find that the need to know each reference declines the further you journey along with Bloom.Have courage and you'll be rewarded. The book is life-affirming and very down-to-earth in its concerns. Joyce borrows the structure of Homer's epic in order to lampoon its myth-making and to play with its martial obsessions. Bloom is no hero. And that's the point."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can't watch The Producers now without thinking of James Joyce.

It is highly praised by some, and it is loathed by others. In this case there can be no middle road. If you like a good, gripping story, then this is not your cup of tea. If you like literature for the sake of fine language, then you are on the right track. Joyce is not out to make the journey through this book easy, in that respect one may get the idea that the story of Ulysses is really the story of the reader's struggle through the book. But there are much riches to be found in it. Perseverance is the key. A reviewer here thinks the GertyMcDowell part to be the best, indeed it is the most readable chapter in the book because it is a parody of cheap 'women's' literature. The other chapters have their own strengths, and it is not unimaginable that each reader will have his or her own favorite chapter (for example, Molly Bloom's incredible soliloquy at the end of the book, or the eerie 'play'-chapter). Go click and buy this work of art, try it, and if you hate it, put it away and return to it in a few years. You may find you savor it then."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I not only read this book, I was taught it. It was the subject of my thesis at Berkeley. However, I would not presume to know a great deal about it. I think I will learn even more the next time I read it.Is it the greatest novel ever? Big question. I haven't read every novel, so I can't say. It's the best novel I have ever read.The novel is much deeper than most people believe. I would think to read it on the surface level only would be pretty boring, except for the lyrical style. But the real brilliance lies in his intertwining several allegorical levels with the action (if it can be called that). Too complicated to go into.Suffice it to say this book is about Everything! and Everyone! The universe contained in one ordinary man in one ordinary city on one ordinary day. We are all warriors and adventurers while at the same time stepped on by cowards and beat up by triviality. We are Leopold Bloom. Didn't you know?Apart from the mind bending, headache inducing allegory, what sets Joyce apart from other twentieth century novelists is the way he makes the English language into music. Joyce truly exhibits the shear beauty of words, creating nothing less than a symphony filled with harmony, dissonance, rythym and syncopation, noise, peace, passion, hopelessness, beauty, and terror that you can hear if you listen and if you let your mind let the words pierce that well disguised wall of cynicism.It's a romantic adventure about the best and the worst in all of us.Helps if you read it with the New Bloomsday Book. Hard to make it through it without it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was inspired to give ULYSSES another try after reading Bartholomew Gill'sDEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR, a detective story whose plot is closely tied to Joyce's great novel. One of Gill's characters gives the advice to let the words flow like music, over you and through you, and not to get hung up in the details. Good advice, I found. If read quickly in this way, ULYSSES is more mesmerizing than it mystifies, and constantly exhilarating despite its occasional tendency to exasperate. I fully expect that a second reading will require a full summer rather than a mere week, and demand the use of a dictionary, a map, and a detailed reader's guide, but a first pass without any of these can still bring enormous pleasure.I did find it almost impossible, however, to read for plot. Although the events in ULYSSES are rather simple and are confined to a single day (Thursday, June 16, 1904), so much is told in flashback or in the imagination that it becomes hard to separate the various strands. I found it helpful to refer to the online Cliff Notes after reading each chapter just to confirm what I thought had happened. And, in real terms, nothing much does. Two men, the young intellectual Stephen Dedalus (Joyce's alter ego fromPORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN) and the fortyish Jewish salesman Leopold Bloom, wake up, leave the house, wander around Dublin for most of the day, crossing paths occasionally, only to come together towards the end of the book and part again before the story ends in the small hours of the following morning. But the plot is only one of several threads that Joyce uses to organize a novel that contains as much of life as he can cram into it; among the other devices that shape the book are parallels with the ODYSSEY, the geography of Dublin, an almost Freudian penetration into the psyche of his characters, an ever-deepening humanity, and a large-scale structural organization akin to the movements and thematic connections within a piece of music.Joyce's language is musical too, and should probably be heard rather than read. His set-pieces -- such as Molly Bloom's famous erotic soliloquy in the Penelope chapter [18] that closes the book, Leopold Bloom's parallel fantasy at the end of Nausicaa [13], the Viceregal procession at the end of Wandering Rocks [10], or the numerous passages of Homeric invocation that punctuate Cyclops [12] -- show his magical ability to weave a spell with words and his exuberant delight in doing so. But there is no single Joycean style; one of the joys of ULYSSES is that each chapter introduces a distinct style of its own. The classical passages in Cyclops [12] are answered by long early-British sections in Oxen of the Sun [14] in which no latinate words are used whatsoever. The intellectual legerdemain of some of the Stephen Dedalus chapters is balanced by the down-to-earth barroom conversations of Leopold Bloom's friends. At different times, Joyce uses the language of magazine stories, the Catholic Church, political rhetoric, or scholastic debate. He includes densely-argued prose, free verse, snippets in six or seven languages (ULYSSES is not merely Irish but cosmopolitan), quotations from opera and street songs, and even two pages of musical notation! Wandering Rocks [10] is composed of brief fragments, like verbal snapshots of Dublin at a particular moment. Ithaca [17] is cast in the form of a catechism that addresses subjective emotional issues with the detailed objectivity of scientific analysis. Circe [15], the longest chapter of all, is a masochistic nightmare written in the form of a play script, or rather a movie scenario years ahead of its time.More than anything else, I found myself reading ULYSSES for the sheer delight of its many styles, and hugely enjoying even those parts that I didn't understand. There are many more treasures to be found in the book, I am sure, but this was more than enough for a start!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The reader of Ulysses is forced to continually reassert his perspective and understanding of point of view when reading the text. The narrative frequently shifts in perspective between Stephen, Bloom, the citizens of Dublin and a faceless narrator operating on levels internal and external. Language is used directly in speech and substantiation, as well as symbolically in mental thought and acquires transcendental meaning in grammatical and spelling reconfiguration.Stephen's typological character is self-defined in Telemachus as that of a servant. As he explains to Haines, \\"I am the servant of two masters... the imperial British state... and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\\" Whether this servitude is literal or self-inflicted, we do not know. We know from Mulligan's remonstrations of Stephen's actions at his dying mother's bedside that Stephen has struggled with the Catholic faith. We know from Haines' knowledge of Gaelic over the milkwoman's that there is a level of intellectual and political dominance in place. We also know this from Haines' self admission, \\"We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\\" This is exactly a point where a reading of Ulysses accompanied by a fair knowledge of the political relationship of England to Ireland and an understanding of the rise of Nationalism during the time in which the novel was placed could add a good deal of understanding to the depths of the characters relations. This will continue to be the case throughout the novel as there are countless allusions to the history of the church and Ireland. There are frequent references by Stephen of historical heroes such as Pyrrhhus, Moses and Parnell who were frustrated while trying to lead a certain people out of bondage. The purpose of these references culminates in the important discussion between Stephen and Bloom toward the end of Ithica about Moses Maimonides and the chanting of the 113th psalm which celebrates the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt. These historic and theological references are important counterpoints to Stephen who in Telemachus declares himself not to be a hero. Though the narrative of the first few chapters can be followed fairly consistently without historic knowledge of this kind, in the later chapters the narrative will cease to make much sense when references are cited and counterpoised to create specific intellectual and sociological meanings in the lives of the characters. Once a fact or idea is raised it will surely resurface at a later time in the thoughts of a character and will be mulled over ad infinitum. It is the discourse of the narrative that gives the best illumination into the classification of characters.Not only does Joyce span the forms of narrative from dialogue to subconscious hallucination, but also he twists the structure of language and words themselves to reassign meaning to language tools whose original purpose was to have a definitive meaning. Consider the final functional unit of the novel. Molly begins her soliloquy with the internal declaration, \\"Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed.\\" The entire soliloquy could be labeled as the indicial knowledge which feeds into the question: will Molly bring Bloom's breakfast to their bed in the morning? However, in the course of this long final narrative the question is eclipsed by the question: will Molly continue to be unfaithful to Bloom? Directly after this is established, it is tempting to speculate about the meaning of the narrative rather than cling to the rules of understanding its structure. Before this point in the narrative we have only had a very short encounter with Molly. The most we have gathered about her character is that of an object of desire. This image is both reinforced and destroyed by her final soliloquy. The answer concerning the original question of breakfast appears to be in the positive as Molly has expressed disappointment in her lover and a remembered passion of her vow to Bloom. This speculation gives a more refined meaning to the narrative as a whole implying a cyclical nature to Dublin life. Molly will bring Bloom his breakfast and he will leave on another journey throughout Dublin leaving her to remain in the bedchamber as an image in the lascivious imagination of the world. This seems to be the consensus of overall criticism of Ulysses. But, as it seems the day of Ulysses was the first day Molly had an affair, this suggests daily life isn't as static as it might first appear and people have the propensity to break from their assigned roles. This is especially true as with Stephen, whose role was to find a father figure or a \\"home\\" in the novel, but Stephen leaves him/it when the discovery is made. Creating final and definitive answers to Ulysses meaning is impossible and we should remain aware of this in conjunction with our methods of reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the second time I've read &quot;Ulysses&quot;. It is a 'hard read' even for me, a good reader; my consistant criticism against Joyce is that he intentionally works to hide his arguments, his characters, and his thematic material behind a mind-boggling wall of style in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;, though his earlier works are quite approachable.Too bad. The book is actually quite deeply human, and funny as hell. Bloom is a decent, bungling 'hero', a human like all of us. He's got his strengths, his weaknesses. I see him wandering flat footed in his black slacks like Charlie Chaplin through the crazy, jangling streets of Dublin. The night-town scene is a burlesque with a keenly penetrating, humanistic mind firmly at the helm. The barroom brawl a riot, especially with the dual narrators; the uneducated clod of low intelligence, and the archaic, mythic intonations of the blabber mouthed rhetoritician.He muses on the wonder of existance; how we, living, dead breaths breath. How man and woman come together, making love and making babies. How, ultimately, we are all connected, umbilically to the past through our connections with the Tribe of Man.&quot;God loves everybody,&quot; says the comic, absurd voice in the barroom scene. It is funny. We grin, chuckle at the absurd voice. But it is true. It is Joyce's central theme.Unfortunately, what he's mostly done is kept a ton of scholars busy writing 'commentaries' for a book that is revelant, all too human, and funny as hell... Perhaps even more hillarious than &quot;Catch-22&quot;... but that's debatable.I give it five stars because I happen, through the graces of a good education, to be able to understand it. It is towering and complex. If you're willing to work, go for it. It will take you some time; took me two solid weeks of work. Still, when you're through, there's a sense of mental satisfaction. You feel like you've solved a great logic puzzle. However, don't just read it for themes; try to recreate the scenes and dialog in your mind. This isn't easy, granted. Joyce's style makes it tough.. but do! The rewards are immeasurable. Once you see these characters as real, solid characters, not as abstractions, the lights begin to shine, and you understand how Joyce sees the mythic/ religious shining through our chaotic, jumble of the modern world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is five or six times the length of most novels, has an army of minor characters to keep up with, and contains a vocabulary that makes prudent keeping handy a good, unabridged English dictionary. (Never mind the German, Italian, French, Gaelic, Yiddish, etc., or the allusions to classical or Irish mythology.) A damned difficult book, it's true. But it captivated me. ULYSSES is by turns crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. During Bloomsday, the people of Joyce's universe eat, ogle women, defecate, bet on horses, worry, work, make love, lift their petticoats and wiggle their behinds, attend funerals, beg, give alms, pray, blaspheme and discuss every subject worth breath from the disposition of Shakespeare's second-best bed to God being a shout in the street to sex in all its manifestations. Yes! O yes! I have never seen anything so rich with the texture and feel and vivid details of life. Add to that Joyce's use of stream of consciousness and interior monologue to draw the reader into the tale with the characters (something no novelist before Joyce, not even Henry James, could pull off) as well as blindingly beautiful stretches of sheer poetry and you are looking at magic. Read this. Truly beautiful things can be as difficult as they are rare."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Definitely buy this Jim Norton version. Do not get the Donal Donnelly version that one reviewer recommends -- I followed his advice and it was a huge mistake, now I am purchasing the Norton version. The Donal version is haltingly slow with disruptive pauses between each word, even in dialogue. It's so bothersome -- the reading is like a 3rd grader would read. This Jim Norton version runs over 27 hours, but the Donal Donnelly version runs over 40 hours -- the extra time? It's spent in awkward pauses that break the flow of the language and the dialogue -- you totally lose the beauty of Joyce. Don't make the costly mistake that I made -- buy the right one the first time. Now that I have this Norton version, I can happily sail through Ulysses and appreciate Joyce's supreme writing. If you really want to get through this novel, the audio is a tremendous help to play along with you as you read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&quot; &quot;Ulysses&quot; begins with an easily understood sentence, identifiable actions and objects, and little of the puns, ambiguities (well, except for what word &quot;stately&quot; modifies) and symbols (ok, maybe the cross on the bowl of lather) for which Joyce is read, and, perhaps just as often, not read.I think it's well worth reading; in fact, it's probably my favorite book (so far), one to which I return often. I think the key to enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely comprehensible inner dialogue. I recommend decoding these selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like, the sound soup without total comprehension. In addition to Joyce's mastery and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity. Criticized by some as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of the &quot;common&quot; person.I can also recommend some books to negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy). (All of these available at Amazon.) While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity. In fact, appreciation of ambiguity is just one of the book's many facets. Just embrace and enjoy &quot;Ulysses&quot;; it is one of the funniest and wisest books you'll read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, this is clearly the most thought out book I have ever read. You go through it, and you pick out any part and say, why must he be so wordy about two people getting a guinness, but you realize that he is putting all the mythical overload into trivial events, and that while it is absurd, it is true. If you can read this book in a class, that would be best, but at least be sure to have a complete guide so that you can get some of the allusions. You don't need to catch EVERYthing. It is very show-offy, a bit like Joyce is trying to just pack every single piece of information he's ever picked up into this novel (or whatever you'd like to call it, I think it is a novel, though). This can be annoying, but it is amazing. And I think that was his point, to describe his world and everything in it, through the story of a common man, whose heroism so deeply embedded in him is overlooked."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've just now downloaded this version (Ulysses [Annotated]), so I can't say how it compares to the other Kindle versions as far as missing text, or any of the other formatting complaints. I can say, it does not appear to be annotated. And indeed, if you go to the actual publisher's site (digireads.com) they do not list it as being such, nor do they mention annotation anywhere in the product description.I know Amazon probably has millions of product descriptions to sort through and try to make accurate. But I'd rather have a vague description than one with added details that prove purely erroneous.I also think their practice of automatically cross-referencing the reviews for different editions of the same book is incredibly unhelpful. Bottom line: this version does not appear to offer any immediately discernible advantages over the free version; save your $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"At the end of one of \\"Ulysses\\" most unpleasantly challenging chapters, \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" Joyce throws out an offhand comment which might read as a sort of gauntlet to anyone who fancies him or herself as a capable reader: \\"Just you try it on.\\"People have been \\"trying on\\" \\"Ulysses\\" ever since, and if my experience is any indication, the result is an infuriating and intoxicating read, not always both at once however. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's terribly self-conscious and clever, serving no purpose except allowing self-aggrandizing deconstructionists and post-modernists a chance to strut their stuff and feel like they have something over the rest of us.I want to be clear in saying I regard \\"Ulysses\\" as a supreme example of craft and literary brilliance, but I don't think it is the great English-language novel, only maybe the most important. J.D. Wombacher said it very well in one of the earlier reviews: \\"My own view is that Ulysses is an example of a writer not doing his job.\\" If a writer's job is to create a novel in such a way as to let the reader in, this is not only a valid sentiment, but a boldly honest one.You start out thinking this isn't going to be as bad as every says. We watch an awkward young man named Stephen deal with his supersmug semi-friend and an annoying British interloper high atop the city of Dublin, in Martello Tower. Stephen is aware of the fact his \\"pal\\" Buck is really a bit of a user, and patronizing as hell, and in subtle, clever, and often funny ways, Joyce lets the reader see how. Then we watch poor Stephen alternately try to instruct a bunch of Anglo-Irish brats and deal with a supercilious headmaster, who fancies himself an expert on everything from livestock to why the sun will never set on the British empire.Then Stephen goes to the beach, and what follows in the third chapter, \\"Proteus,\\" is something that would make any good editor cry out for a rewrite. Joyce noted that his writing skills by the time he got to \\"Ulysses\\" were of such an advanced degree that he could do anything he wanted to with the English language, but there's ample evidence in the finished work that such absolute power can corrupt absolutely.At least Joyce seems to realize this, too, somewhat. He shifts the focus to another social outcast, a Jewish advertising salesman named Leo Bloom who busies himself with the stream of life around the fair city of Dublin so as to avoid going home, where he knows his fat wife is about to carry on an affair with a callow bounder.The results are some of the most affecting chapters ever written, each one slightly askew from the next, but forming a kind of whole that takes into account the whole history of literature, while advancing that history into unexplored territory with stream-of-consciousness narratives and multiple perspectives. Chapters like \\"Wandering Rocks,\\" \\"Sirens,\\" and especially \\"Cyclops\\" work on so many levels they make the head spin, and Joyce the humorist (he claimed one of his principal goals in writing \\"Ulysses\\" was to make the reader laugh) rivals Twain in his humanistic humorousness. Witness this sardonic exchange in \\"Cyclops,\\" my favorite chapter.\\"Dead?\\" says Alf. \\"He is no more dead than you are!\\"\\"Maybe so,\\" says Joe. \\"They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\\"But do we really need the mindgames of \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" or the play-form phantasmagoria of \\"Circe,\\" which lead us into blind alleys and throw enough red herrings to kill us with mercury poisoning? People say you need to read the Greek legend this all is based on, and I didn't, but I don't think I'm alone in finding this tangent strained. When Stephen finally ditches his false friend, he does so off-stage as it were, and it is never explained what transpired. Critics have their ideas why the connection between Stephen and Bloom, once made, is so vital, but it eluded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did.The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games. That leaves out the rest of us.I'm glad I read this book, and hope God grants me the time to read it again someday. But don't believe the hype. Read \\"Ulysses,\\" but don't sweat what you don't get. Many of those who say they do \\"get\\" it are kidding themselves. Better to be honestly perplexed, and humbled by the experience. Humility has its virtues, and Joyce might have benefited from it more in writing this, creating a real masterpiece for the masses rather than an ivory tower to which only he held the key."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is not a book out there that is more frustrating than James Joyce's Ulysses...unless, of course, it is Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. The problem lies in the fact that this novel is such an amazing piece of art that the reader can feel like Joyce forgot all about him. It is almost impossible to read by oneself with it's seemingly garbled maze of words and phrases and madness. However, this is what makes it such a joy to read. Imagine that an author decided to do away with any and all rules concerning fiction and to write a book that was it's own entity, showing you what it wanted to show you, telling you what it wanted to tell you and acting like its own character. This is what Joyce has accomplished with Ulysses. I was fortunate enough to read this book in a class, four months of nothing but Ulysses, and I have to warn would be readers that I don't think I would have made it through without expert guidance. I would advise anyone wishing to tackle this literary giant to gather some book loving friends, and a guidebook or two for Ulysses, and to take it very slowly. Read a chapter a week and then meet up with you group to discuss and puzzle out what you have just read. I am willing to bet that your weekly conversations will be a greater work of art than any book out there, and I think that Joyce would have liked that, would have enjoyed sparking debates and conversation, its probably the main reason why anyone creates anything; for it to be enjoyed and shared. The story line is simple, you have two main characters, Stephen Dedalus, the brilliant but alienated loner. You have Leopold Bloom, a simple man who is as alienated as Stephen, but not for his mind, for his cultural background and meek manner. The entire book takes place over the course of one day in Dublin, and after the first three chapters the entire book simply follows Bloom around during a day when he knows that his wife is having a romantic meeting with her lover. It is hard to sum up such a giant book in a few sentences like this, but basically Bloom is trying to set his life back on track, trying to reconcile himself with his wife's betrayal, and trying to reach out to Stephen who he feels could use a loving family. Of course, you could read this book and not find any of what I am saying in there, but the beauty of Ulysses is that I would love to hear what it is that you found in this novel as much as I would love sharing what I found."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There's probably not much about Ulysses that hasn't already been said, but having just spent well over a month of my free time struggling through this book I thought I would put my two cents in.In my opinion, Judge John M. Woolsey's synopsis in his 1933 ruling on the work's obscenity charge sums up the book almost perfectly. It is indeed an astonishing achievement and a literary tour de force. It is, as he says, by turns brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure. And of course it is unprecedented in its exceptionally honest treatment of sexuality.I really can't agree with his contention, however, that every word of the book is purposeful in its contribution to the whole. In some ways, particularly the incredible realism of its characters' interior monologues and its ability to make a particular place and time come alive for the reader, Ulysses is perhaps the most well-written novel I've ever read. In other ways, namely Joyce's frequent inability to resist showing off his erudition and mastery of language, it is one of the worst and often cries out for editing. While there's not a word of Hades, Wandering Rocks or Penelope I would change, some other chapters (e.g., Cyclops, Oxen of the Sun, and Ithaca) become downright tedious despite their conceptual ingenuity and flashes of brilliance. Additionally, the book is sometimes cloyingly self-referential, plausibility too often bows to symbolism, and many of Joyce's allusions are so esoteric or ambiguous that they can only serve to distract the reader. While it has faults (and despite the book's deification in literary circles, I can't see any other way to characterize many of its quirks and stylistic excesses), Ulysses is nonetheless well worth the exceptional effort required to read it due to its penetrating and poignant illumination of human desires, delusions and relationships. As an added plus, at many points it is nothing less than hilarious.Personally I found it very helpful to listen to a recording of the text on audio to get through the book (the version narrated by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie published by Classics on Cassette is extremely well done), as twice previously I had attempted to read it without such support and couldn't get beyond six or seven chapters. I would also suggest having at hand an unabridged dictionary, a book of scholarly annotations, and especially Harry Brimes' Bloomsday book for those passages where, despite your best efforts, you still can't figure out what the heck is going on (occasionally Brimes can't either).Four stars may seem niggardly for a masterpiece, but I'm comparing it with King Lear and The Brothers Karamazov. If you're an Irish Catholic literary scholar with doctorates in western religion and etymology and an upcoming sabbatical, by all means add half a star."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"On June 16th, 1904, a young James Joyce met his future wife for the first time. Ten years later, in 1914, he began what would become one of the greatest epics of modern language, Ulysses, setting the entirety of the events within that one special day shared by him and his wife, offering it to the world in an alternately joyous and tragic, comical and dense tribute to life and to living.The story cannot be summarised without reciting the book itself, an exercise that goes beyond the scope of this review. Suffice to say that the novel follows Leopold Bloom as he makes his way about Dublin, and Stephen Dedalus as he wanders from place to place. The two eventually meet, and the book finishes. Then again, that description is like saying Moby Dick is about a whale and Gravity's Rainbow is about a rocket. Technically true, but how much detail and texture do you miss with such a soul-less description?Ulysses has since grown beyond itself, garnering a reputation that scares away most readers. Considered an 'ivory tower' book, a 'professor's dream', it should be admitted that there are very difficult sections. Whole chapters - most of which are quite long - can be extremely tedious to read, becoming bogged down in medical or legal terms which serve mostly to confuse and distract the reader. But then there are chapters of amazing insight, clarity, wisdom and skill - thankfully more than there are difficult. The Cyclops chapter is sheer genius, a 120-page play that moves from bizarre to hilarious to sublime and back again. By itself, it is almost worth the price of admission, but there are many more that are just as amazing. The question and answer chapter of Ithaca is sheer genius, and Molly's monologue, right at the end, while texturally dense, flows and runs like a river.The language used ranges from flowery to technical to simplistic to overly complicated to deliberately obscure to beautiful. 'Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide' is beautiful, whereas 'What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?' is difficult. Of course, there is always the famous 'The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit', quite possibly one of the most gorgeous sentences written by man.Another interesting technique Joyce uses is his willingness to deny the luxury of perfect sentence structure or grammar to better convey the mood of the characters, or to greater achieve those wonderful sentences. He merges words, removes words, adds words, mirrors sentences within themselves, juxtaposes letters, words, paragraphs, all in an effort to create passages of absolute delight. Tens of pages will fly by, each one filled with wit, insight, beauty, depth. At times, it is safer to simply let go and trust that Joyce knows what he is doing, that you will be taken where you should go.However. This book can be very difficult, as I said above. Fifty pages of dense, verbose prose with little to no indication of what is happening, who it is happening to, or what sort of reference can be applied so as to make sense of it in the greater scheme of the novel, is common. These parts can be tricky to get through, but I strongly advise you to continue. Happily, the first few chapters are very easy, and very beautiful. It is only around the 210 page mark that Joyce ramps up the difficulty, which culminates in the Wandering Rocks and Siren chapters. But bear with it, and enjoy it for what it is.In the end - and I hope I have made this clear - the novel is a difficult one, requiring a lengthy time commitment, but in the end, the efforts are more than rewarded. Having just turned the last page, closed the book and put it aside, I am itching to take it up again, to follow Bloom and Dedalus once more through their beautiful, wonderful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought theUlysses (Gabler Edition)edition of this book recently as we were reading Ulysses as part of an online book club. The advantage of that edition is that it is popular edition and also has line numberings so that as part of a group you can immediately locate a piece of text.Then I discovered that you could get a free Kindle edition, so I downloaded the free Kindle for computer app from Amazon, and got this edition. Later I bought a Kindle.I am somewhat surprised at the one star reviews of a free product, the leading one of which is based on a flawed premise, lack of comparison to an actual published text.This reviewer does not compare the Kindle text with an actual book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, finding inconsistencies and saysUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] is different. Ulysses annotated is not Ulysses the book, it is a reference book about Ulysse, and if you imagine it, it operates like a phrase dictionary and explains the references and allusions in the book, but it is not the book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, not a direct comparison with an actual copy of the book, and comparison with an entirely different book. Really?I have compared this with the Gabler and picked 20 lines at random from the book, and then searched the Kindle edition, and read the surrounding passages. Except for one case in the Gabler edition which has musical notation and lyrics to a song the text was 100% the same.Obviously, there will be inconsistencies between versions of a book that has many editions. That does not mean that just because this edition is free and has minor inconsistencies it is worse than other editions. Nor does it mean that large amounts of text have been deleted because it's free. No, it's based on an actual text. In fact Joyce edited and added bits and pieces to the text over the years much to the chagrin and frustration of his publishers, so you can expect minor variations between editions, yet they may be 95-99% similar.In fact, there are certain advantages to having the Kindle edition. If you have ever read a book and you are trying to remember something about a character, you can type in the characters name, and you will immediately get all the references in the book. If there is a word you do not understand fully, by pressing a button you can immediately get the full meaning of the word. You can check for popular highlights, and it willl tell you how many people have highlighted which passage. For example \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible.\\"There are certain passages that no dictionary will help you with, and that is why you may need a companion book, such as Ulysses annotated, which explains the many allusions, whether to Latin, parallels with the Bible, with the Odyssey which this story loosely parallels, to Latin, British Rule, historical context, local maps, Hamlet, mythical search for the missing father, Shakespeare and the Bible.The further you get into this book the better it gets.At once this book is inpiring yet challenging, sometimes perplexing yet ultimately rewarding. Full of inventive wordplay that sometimes defies instant comprehension. I have read entire pages that turn out to be word salad at first. Every chapter has a different narrative style, such as inner monologue, narcissistic, catechism, stream of consciousness. Sometimes this book is brutal to read, sometimes a joy. I can understand why this book is so influential, and the words nibble at the edge of your consciousness forcing your mind to expand itself. This book has changed the way I think about writing, as I have never seen som many different narrative devices used in a single book before. The final chapter with Molly Bloom in bed, with its runon sentences is simply hilarious.I encourage you to get this edition. Why not? It's free. Free to buy. Free to read. Free to enjoy. The Kindle format gives you advantages over people who have read it in the past, and offers interesting, new, and quicker ways of navigating the text.And you can go get free online chapter summaries of chapters to speed your comprehension.I hope you found this review helpful."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Looking at the sample chapters of the 99c MobileReference edition, I notice an entire missing paragraph (after \\"and chanted:\\").

But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.In Ulysses, James Joyce uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple Irishmen (Stephen Dedalus and his friend, Leopold Bloom) and the people with whom they interact. Joyce's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off. While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out. As Ulysses meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc. The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form. How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, &quot;What was that?&quot; But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...It is impossible to sum this book up. It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day. A few people... 1 day.Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, &quot;I have no idea what is going on here.&quot; While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Ulysses, I was always able to appreciate Joyce's writing, even if the individual words were all I understood. For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Joyce's beautiful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks.

Very well produced, even to the extent of reversing the audio in Circe where 'The Voice Of All the Damned' proclaims the mighty: Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella!Music tracks introduce each section, with songs appropriately chosen for the episode.

Then read the book about it by Stuart Gilbert, and reread it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It has been said that the title should arrest the casual onlooker as if it was read: The Bible. Ulysses is James Joyce's Bible. What does one gain from reading this novel? Joyce has such a command of our language that it becomes putty in the hands of an artist. Each chapter has its own technique. Joyce wears a different mask for each section so that the reader sees the history of the English language unfold before him. Joyce remains the super-artist however, peering down from his overworld of the ulimate artist. Reading Ulysses will make all modern fiction seem to be the ineluctable flotsam in the path of the Joycean mothership. So who is Ulysses the character? What is Ulysses? Odysseus? Odysseus is the beloved Greek figure who appears in the form of Leopold Bloom. Ulysses was the despised, bloodthirsty, Roman rabblerowser who ended up in one of Dante's jivin' circles. Bloom is not Ulysses. Ulysses is something else. Everything else. A three in one of Bloom, Stephen, Molly; Father, son, mother(holy ghost); Scientist, artist, lover; the meeting place of lust and compassion: Word known to man: Love.

The most spinalcrushingly dense text this side of the Marquis De Sade and Rabelais, Joyce evolves the subconscious greatness of Bloom by using thousands of references from 20th Century Industrial Europe and weaving them into million mile high levels of plot and thought. Joyce carries subtlety and grace with each poetic sentence and each step of character development; you don't just read, you experience, you live within this world. Immerse yourself in the essence that is Ulysses, whether your teacher assigns it to you or not"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the story of one day in the life of Leopold Bloom, an Irish jew. The novel follows his travels and ends with his meeting of Stephen Dedaulus. By reading the novel, the reader is able to see Bloom's character fleshed out before his eyes, as well as to tap into the personalities of the numerous other characters on the busy Dublin street. Symbolically, the novel parallels Homer's Odyssey, depicting the great &quot;journey&quot; that Bloom travels in one day.Although Ulysses is difficult to read, it is not impossible to complete. However, before even attempting to read this novel, it is best to have previously read several other pieces of literature to aid in the comprehension of the story. You should first already be familiar with Joyce's writings; read both Dubliners to get a feel of Joyce's style, and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young to fully understand the maturation of Stephan Dedaulus' character. Next, read the Odyssey, preferrable a verse translation. I'd recommend Robert Fagles version. Finally, it is also helpful to have read Hamlet, be familiar with both the Old and New Testament of The Bible, and know a little about early 19th century Irish history.Even if you are a literary scholar, you will probably still find some parts--probably even whole chapters--confusing or even incomprehensible. One unique characteristic of Ulysses is its style. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not completely written in the stream of consciousness style. Instead, each of the novel's chapters has a characteristic style, ranging from straigt narration to an almost 200 page long play. This can be a bit aggravating for the reader. Another confusion of the chapters is there exact parrallel to the Odyssey. Each chapter does have a parrallel chapter in the Odyssey but while some similiarities can easily be distinguished in the plot, other parrallels are only apparent in symbolism and style. Because of these difficulties it is best to read the CliffsNotes on this book while reading the novel.Overall, I can tell you that Ulysses is quite interesting in some parts and very very dull in others. If you are a fan of literature, I would recomend reading it sometime. Truefully, Ulysses was good but not as great as it thought it would be. My favorite parts of the book were simply the ones that helped to reveal Bloom's character. I got annoyed by the fact that too many other characters appeared and were characterized but actually had very little to do with the story's plot. The plot itself is a bit weak and Joyce is a bit too over-indulgent and is purposefully confusing in describing some of the action of the story (its 783 pages!). Also, in order to understand all of the novel's symbols you would have to read several literary references and this would take forever. I also think that Joyce sort of went a bit too far with literary styles. Some were good but others not so much. I liked the narrative and stream of consciousness chapters, but personally thought that the play chapter failed to convey its message and was meandering. And why wasn't there a chapter in epic format (as was the Odyssey) or other form of poem (Stephen was supposed to be a poet). Finally, I do not believe that Ulysses was universal enough to be considered a masterpiece. One of the great aspects of world literature is that it is supposed to let reader from other countries understand what it is like to live in the country in which the novel takes place. Joyce did try to achieve this goal, but he presented many viewpoints about Irish politics and facts about political figures (Parnell) with even trying to allow the non-Irish reader to understand these people or concepts.Dispite its problems, I would recommend reading Ulysses but if there is any other book you would like to read, read it first because Ulysess does seem to drag on forever. Don't expect to understand all of Ulysses or be excited about unraveling its symbolism. In order to understand most of the symbolism you have to read the CliffsNotes and this kind of ruins the fun of self discovery. The book is not as contreversial as I thought it would be--really the only parts that would warrant censorship are contained in the last chapter (Molly's monologue) but these are rather provactive. Overall, the plot of Ulysses does not neccesarily always make the best story nor could I actually call it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but the book is interesting if you are a fan of Joyce and have the time to spend on it. It took me just short of three weeks to finish it. If you are just reading the book for fun (not for a class) I'd recommend reading it over summer or a holiday because it is definately not a light or short read by any means."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique.

It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul.

To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is a book well worth reading in any form. It is a beautiful story that compounds an epic journey into the sights and sounds of one day. This edition is a good place to begin reading Ulysses because it is a reprint of the first text as it appeared in 1922. While this text has many errors, many noted by the author himself, it is still one of the best representations we have of Joyce's intentions. The editor Jeri Johnson also contributes commentary that is invaluable to those people like me who are first starting to read Joyce. With Oxford University Press as the publisher what is there to doubt?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"(This is for the leather bound version of the book.)One of the greatest works of literature in beautiful, leather bound format.

Enjoy it on your e-reader. Probably adults will be more inclined to enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, the way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not nearly as difficult as it is proclaimed to be, this book seems to have taken Nietzsche's advice to heart: A great writerwrites at such an elevated level that most people cannot understand him. This is absolutely true of Ulysses, as the convoluted meditations of the characters and abrupt jumps from reveries and memories to actual events do a marvellous job to perplex the reader.Content: Countless riddles, allusions, metaphors, even intended misspells complicate the reader's life but hardly make this philosphical novel unreadable. Yes, philosphical novel, something you can meditate on after reading. Also, it seems that James Joyce has decided to intertwine modernism, Homer, Irish history, human ethics, and his view on religion and life alltogether, in parts creating a pulp of dense bombast. The modernist techniques are somewhat amusing at first, but after advancing deeply into the book they seem nothing more than ostentatious display by Joyce of his masterful writing ability. There are some faint references to sex and bodily functions, but so subtle as to leave me in mystery of the reason for its ban. Disseminated over a variety of subject, Ulysses does not fail to include relgion and allocate to it a share of the onus. However absurd the concept of religion is, it does serve a purpose in a few of the chapters. Also, Ulysses is famous for its blatant Homeric parallel: each chapter of Ulysses modeled on a Homeric adventure or character. It is truly amazing how the two are combined. To understand the content of this literary behemoth with more insight, one might consult either Pinkmonkey.com (free) or Cliffnotes, both equally helpful.Characters: The characters could have used a lot more dimensionality. Frugal on polishing their facets, James Joyce seems to be using them as puppets to mouth his philosophy and not much more. Usually a protagonist attracts empathy of the reader, but Joyce did a poor job with his characters as they seem very distant in their meditative drivel. In other words, there wasn't a single way I could relate to them. Even Joyce's flaccid attempt at adding flaws to their character by assigning obscenities, made them no more human or real. Perhaps simplifying the embellished bombast would have helped in understanding them.Overall: Despite its many flaws (e.g. length, verbosity, etc...) there is no other book that deserves your attention as much as this particular one. If you will just find perseverance to bear through Joyce's daunting baffling narration, you will be delected to have found it (perseverance) to finished such a marvellous literary accomplishment. Having said that, I favor \\"The Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man\\" by Joyce over Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"... The critics rave about Ulysses. Many readers who've slogged all the way through proclaim it to be the greatest book of the 20th Century. Put me in the camp of those who thinks it's a pile of gibberish.It's the only book I've ever read that still had me scratching my head after three chapters. Is it a novel? A series of unrelated short stories? A poem? Apparently, only intellectuals can tell.I was taught that writing is the process of communicating with readers. This book fails miserably at that. I honestly can't summarize the plot. I didn't understand it. Maybe I'm stupid, but I think the fact that Joyce repeatedly breaks into long stretches of French and Latin and his own made-up words--none of which I understand--has something to do with it.I give the book two stars because of Joyce's obvious mastery of vocabulary, and because maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too ignorant to comprehend the genius. But I doubt it. To me, reading enjoyment shouldn't be this hard. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The book is simply wonderful, and there is nothing I can say that is more eloquent or unusual than the other many reviews before me.The only thing I would like to mention, is my thoughts on the end. That one, long, run-on sentence. To my mind at least, it felt like he understood perfectly the way a woman can think.Of course I'm generalizing, but I read a review written by a man who'd read the first 50 pages, then skipped to the end to find that flow of thought, and thought it was perfectly weird.I felt sorry when I read that, because the way the thoughts swirl in and out and round about and seem to build with 'fervorency'(is that a word? did I spell it right?), is exactly the way my thoughts wander on occasion, and I marvelled at the way Joyce seemed to be privy to that sort of, what I consider to be, 'female' thought.It was beautiful. I enjoyed it more than I can say. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple things: First off, everyone's heard of Ulysses, and everyone has their own notions of what they expect from a book, what they expect from Ulysses in particular, and how they feel about experimental literature in general (though by today's standards Ulysses appears vastly less experimental than, say, Finnegan's Wake). So basically, if you don't think you'll like Ulysses, you probably won't. And no, it's not a casual read. If you're willing to do some homework, though, which in my case included some Homer, Shakespeare, Freud, and Irish history (though I could go on), it just might be worth your time (lots of time) to slog through all 900+ pages of the thing. But that's just my two cents.The real reason I'm writing this review is to steer people away from the 'reader's edition' of Ulysses--that's the reason for the two stars. This is not the novel as Joyce intended--it is an adaptation by Danis Rose, and reflects what he (Rose) thought was 'accurate.' Though the changes he makes are minor--and, in all fairness, may correct oversights made by Joyce--I am offended by the idea that an editor has the ability to take an important and influential work and make changes as he sees fit. The fact that this edition was ever put to print debases the role of the artist (any artist), and reflects the increasing trend toward commercialization and dumbing-down of art in favor of turning a profit.So--is Ulysses the greatest artistic achievement in any medium, ever? I don't know, and whether I think so is irrelevant anyway. But if you want to find out for yourself, please, PLEASE, at least read Joyce's words, not Rose's."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book -- the physical object, that is, and not just the text. (Because if you're willing to pay this much for a copy of &quot;Ulysses&quot; you obviously take that for granted.) The volume is larger in size than typical hardcover books today, meaning that the type is a decent readable size and the margins are generous (for the note jotting fiends among us). Great care has clearly been taken in the choice of paper and the sewn binding, which allows the book to lay flat during reading and insures years of re-reading. Although there is no dustjacket the cover is made of very durable material; various cover protectors can be found to stand in or, for the really paranoid, a slipcase can be made or found. It should be added that the text is presented as originally published, so there are no notes or glosses to help the first-time or casual reader; neither are the episodes keyed to any of the line numberings found in other editions. However, those wishing to refer to notes would be best off buying one of the helpful readers' companions by Gifford or Blamires anyway. In relation to other available editions, this one occupies a vast middle ground between the throwaway mass-market paperbacks on the one hand and the out-of-reach collectors' editions on the other. The book's durability and elegant though understated presentation should prove most attractive to those readers who intend to read the text again and again, whether for pleasure or for study. In short, this volume is a keeper."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can this book be compared to others when it is so different? It has very little exciting plot. From what I have read of Joyce he has little imagination for pulling the reader to the edge of his or her seat, and keeping the reader up for hours past his or her bed time waiting to see what happens next. He does, however, have great knowledge of english language among other things, and uses it well. I LOVED reading this book, but not because of how much better it is than all other books (because it isn't), but because I couldnt wait to see what all of the fuss was about! You should definately get it for the same reason. By the way, Random House, the company that rated it number one has sole publishing rights to Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are a few things you need to understand Joyce. A willingness to set aside race hatred is one. The ability to follow a poet even though he uses a number of different writing styles and narrative techniques. The capacity to explore religious ideas which may not rigidly conform to your own fundamentalist views. And most of all a heart which can feel compassion for all humanity, not just your own myopic tribe, sect, or church. If you have just one of these qualities you will find an unforgettable, life-altering adventure in between the covers of this book. If there is any book out there that has the power to restore one's love for the human race it is Ulyssess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is a mistake to try to read this book along side the Gilbert &quot;skeleton key.&quot; It would be like simultaneously looking at a painting and reading a book on the details of the painting and why we should like the painting.It is not the easiest book to get through. It is not Mike Mulligan and the Steam Shovel or any of the Lord of the Rings books. This is heavy stuff because this book pushes the written word to where it becomes art. The uncreated conscience of someone's race, perhaps.I have read it a few times. I have read certain favorite chapters (like Lestrygonians) at least a dozen. I pick it up from time to time and it is a joy. Aeolus read aloud by someone who knows what they're doing is quite funny.Read the first chapter. Read the Burgess book. Relax. This isn't a book to be consumed like a can of Busch. It is meant to be sipped and appreciated.I can't think of what other book could top the century's greatest works. Some other people prefer Busch. Nothing against Busch, but this book is like none other."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a question that has come up many times. First of all, let me make it clear that I haven't finished Ulysses. I'm in the middle of it, but I feel that I can give a fair review with the amount of it I have read, and I want to review it with it fresh on my mind. Ulysses is not the best novel ever made. Since there is nothing else like it, you can't compare it to anything. It isn't revolutionary, and it doesn't teach the reader any valuable lessons in life, like the Lord of the Rings, Catcher in the Rye, or to Kill a Mockingbird. However, it is insanely enjoyable. The monologues of thought and conversations, as well as descriptions, are beautiful. I can't recommend Ulysses to anyone, however, because I'm sure alot of people hate it. It's difficult to understand (at parts), and contains many cultural references (to Ireland), which confuses the reader even more. Something similar to Cliff's Notes might help. If you have read books challenging on the philosophical level before, I can't imagine a better choice for your next novel than Ulysses. (unless, of course, you haven't read the Lord of the Rings or the Catcher in the Rye :oP)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Few booka are as gripping, confounding, and ultimately satisfying as this vast novel. A true MUST READ for anyone serious about English literature or looking to grow a few new brain cells. Easily one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you didn't read Ulysses, you would never know what the English language is capable of expressing. Ulysses is like no other novel I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, but you come out loving Mr.Bloom at the end of it. It's very hard to read at first, but helper books such as Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated and Stuart Gilbert's book point out what techniques Joyce is using. I think Ulysses is like a cult classic - you either get hooked on to it, or you get turned off by the abstruseness. So don't give up easy, and you will enjoy it once you start realizing the intricacies of of Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, James Joyce's seminal work,has had a profound effect on millions of readers. Ulysses is both crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. It shows the reader a glimpse of one man's struggle to define himself amidst the chaos of modern experience. Ulysses is, perhaps, the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature of the 20th century.Also recommended: REDEFINING THE SELF: SELECTED ESSAYS ON SWIFT, POE, PINTER, AND JOYCE by John Condon Murray"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Simply put, this is the ultimate novel.

Well, a great pioneering work such as this would probably have to take chances or it wouldn't be the work that it is. But suffice to say, when it all comes together properly it can blow you away. My favorite sections, \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" and \\"Penelope,\\" seem to me to be unequalled in their raw intellectual and psychic power. Like the epic upon which it is based, \\"Ulysses\\" spends an inordinate amount of time and emotional energy on the nature of the marital relationship. The great tension of \\"The Odyssey,\\" the question of whether Odysseus can get home in time to keep his wife faithful, is turned on its head in \\"Ulysses,\\" where the wanderer makes a conscious decision to stay away from his unfaithful wife but is doomed to continue to wonder resignedly how he can resolve their sad situation. Don't be afraid to consult Cliff's Notes your first time through, but don't try to catch every nuance either, or you'll go crazy. But this is one book that will truly haunt you no matter how you approach it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If I hadn't read the book, I think I would simply on the basis of the controversy within this review listing. I think the people who gave it one star should forgive the book it's difficulty and direct their hostility away from it's five-star constituency. Personally, I find the difficulty of the work to be one of its many rewards. But its difficulty really starts to fade after a couple hundred pages as you get used to Joyce's protean style, and settle into Leopold Bloom's head. For those who deride the book's fans as pseudo-intellectual sycophants, I just want to say that most of the pleasures I derived from the book were not intellectual at all. I found it a very moving and uplifting story of the heroism inherent in the simple affirmation of going through an ordinary day. That Joyce implements the whole cultural arsenal of Western Civilization to conduct such a simple story is the evidence of his genius, and if that is too intellectual, I still feel richer for wading in the depths of his book. For it really contains all, or at least it seems to--the epic scope of the book dwarfs the reader coming into it. I certainly wouldn't read this book in order to feel intellectually superior to anyone. I imagine those who enjoy it rather feel humbled from the process. At any rate, I loved it. It is a treasure, the most amazing and titanic example of literature moving forward ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am on the last 100 pages of - what is in all liklihood - the hardest book I have ever read. How I feel about the book is still in question. Some parts I have found very poetic, lyrical, truthful, and yes! even slightly titillating; but, I must say, the vast majority of the book I think is not so much as boring as it is protracted and useless. However, with all due credit to Joyce, it's always honest. Very honest! I found Joyce's other work &quot;Portrait of the Artist...&quot; far more readable and inspiring. So, I don't thinks it's being unfair to Joyce when one says that Ulysses is extremely over-rated. Furthermore the novel seems to have a sort of literary snob appeal for those pseudo intellectuals (and/or Joyce-devotees) who feign some sort of intellectual epiphany from the experience of reading it. For them, yet perhaps another way to separate themselves from the &quot;unappreciative, uninitiated, unenlightened reading masses.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ulises, es un libro maravillosamente disenado, esta bien de que el autor sea tildado de pedante por haber puesto en el libro cada cosa que se le viniera a la cabeza y hacerlo un poco duro de seguir, pero el libro tiene su valor y no en vano ha siso alabado desde que salio. su complicada estructura se presta a analisis de diferentes esferas de la mente humana. se puede ver como una asociacion de ideas y se necesita de una gran memoria o de una libreta para poder encontrar las referencias o leitmotiv del libro que estan donde menos las pienses. cada capitulo de ulises representa un estilo de narracion y cada uno es una pequena obra en si independiente de las demas. que no encontremos el significado inmediato no significa que sea malo, sino que el autor no estaba pensando en dar a su obra un significado,ese surge mientras lees la obra. los capitulos parecen no tener secuencia logica y los personajes parece que hablan disparates pero si miras bien y lees con calma puedes ver que hay un hilo conductor de la historia, linda parodia de un clasico. cada capitulo es una referencia a la odisea, aunque en algunos de ellos no esta claro a que se refiere hasta el final. es una obra para gente que quiera aprender que las mejores obras estan escritas para satisfacer no a un publico sino a uno mismo y cuando el escribia quien mas disfrutaba era JOYCE LUIS MENDEZ"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses begins where A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man left off. Stephen Dedalus has left Ireland only to return to his dying mother. Just because you've read and understood Portrait, don't expect Ulysses to come quite as easily. It's rough going in spots but well worth the effort of getting through. In the process you will be taken through 783 pages that encompass less than a twenty-four hour period in the life of Stephen, the Blooms and Dublin. And what a day it is. Everything you might imagine happens, and much more than you ever could imagine also occurs. From the uneasy start of Stehpen's day to his boring job as a teacher he plods through his mind as he tries to plod through his life. In the course of the day a man dies, a woman gives birth, Stephen finds himself at the library discussing his theories of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and that paternity may very well be legal fiction. Also during this same day Leopold Bloom is going about his routine business in Dublin and finally fatherless Stephen meetssonless Bloom. They venture off into the night world where the present and past hallucinate in a theatre of the mind living nightmare that culminates with Bloom taking Stephen under his wing. And while all this was going on, Mrs. Bloom, Molly has had her own sort of day. The Blooms have an odd relationship yet manage to maintain a bond through their thoughts that neither of them does well in putting into words to one another. Whatever they do, they do with full thought and awareness of the other. What makes this book so terrific is the wide ranges in style that Joyce uses. Each episode is like a novel in itself. There is no boredom or tediousness to get through, the main thing that makes it difficult are the constant allusions and references that Joyce makes that may have you wondering at times just what is going on. There are a number of good books to refer to while reading Ulysses and they can make it easier, but even without them, it's worth plunging forward and reading it all. The novel covers everypart of human existance from the banal to the sublime. You will not be in doubt as to what these people are feeling or thinking, their stream of inner consciousness takes up most of the book. And what's great about that is in finding out what these people are about you can learn something about yourself that you were not previously aware of."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having tried and read many sections of this one, but never from beginning to end, plus having read innumerable reviews, and browsed thru all kinds of analyses of it, I can only conclude that it is generally way over-rated..Think of all the near-unknown great books by authors who are hardly recognized, who have written mythological, historical \\"Days in the Life\\" Novels..OK, so Molly gets excited at the end, and we witness a shaving scene in the beginning, with everything in between. Even as a fairly knowledgable literacy person, it is about impossible to read this without a reference guide. All in all simply very over-rated..However, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is a beautifully done book, truly worthy of its lofty reputation, so my suggestion is to read PORTRAIT , plus the stories first, and if frustrated by this one, simply move to something else! There are literally thousands and thousands to choose from!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would have to say that I have easily read close to 1,000 books in my lifetime. I would also easily have to say that I have never read a book that was as incomprehensible as Ulysses. I really do not believe that one has to have cliffnotes or any type of 'helpers' to read and understand a book. Yet, I firmly believe that Ulysses should be accompanied by several texts explaining page by page what you just read. It was so disjointed and difficult to comprehend that I was beginning to question my sanity in even attempting to sift through it and find a plot. I would not recommend it to anyone and I feel sorry for English majors who are forced to read it. I chose to read it and would not make that choice a second time."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I see that this printing is out of stock. May it stay so. Ulysses is the most beautiful book I have ever encountered and I would urge everyone to become familiar with it and add to their familiarity for as long as they live. That being said, the magnum opus of scholarly works this book has (and will continue to have) added is such that much of it constitutes a forever living and growing part of Ulysses itself. As such, some consistency in pagination is crucial as there is a long established convention of referring to specific lines, words etc ... that is employed by any and every Joyce scholar on the planet. Past reprints and revisions of Ulysses have either maintained the original pagination or indicated in marginalia a mapping to the original. Why Penguin would completely obliterate this (and by extension make the cannon of Joyce scholarship almost unusable) is beyond me. If you want to read Ulysses and have no opportunity to benefit from the insight of others (including those that Joyce worked with on this) then get this book and try to enjoy it in a bubble. Otherwise, it would behoove you to get a printing that respects this book and the reader for what they are."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the British were right to repress the Irish: give them a little freedom, and this is what they do. Every redblooded fellow, of course, has appreciated an analogous phenomenon in Catholic coeds, but here, we had hoped, the subject might be literature, and more than rampant effusiveness might be expected.Don't get me wrong; I don't despise length or density. My favorite book as a kid was _Moby Dick_. I have read _Anatomy of Melancholy_ cover to cover (once: phew). My favorite novel now is _Magic Mountain_. And every several years I reread Boswell. Neither do I mind a little murk: my favorite McCarthy is _Sutree_ in preference to the one about the pretty ponies. I don't mind a degree of exigetical tussle in my reading either. I have been a English teacher for thirty years, so I have ruined more literature by careful analysis than any other cowpoke in the saloon, I reckon.Some here - preening with professorial preciosity, I think - have opined that those who do not appreciate this work, crippled by an unsophisticated need for plot, cling and suckle, eyes closed, to silly old books telling tales suited to their larval sensibilities. Well, plot or not, dull is dull, I say. Plot may be many things - a string for beads, and armature for papier-mache, a rational basis for irrational digression - or it may be absent; but the notion that playing around with plot is so terribly nouveau, and therefore so incumbent on those who would be literarily hip, is preposterous. Think of Sterne, Rabelais, Melville.Some fool even asserted that it is brilliant for a book to be tedious, for life is so, and thus a book as militantly tedious as this is true to life in a way that an interesting book could never be. What desperate rationalization is this?The first time - age 19 - that I tried to read this book, I failed to finish it. I made the attempt because it is a book \\"one\\" reads. I was \\"one\\" back then, had not yet become myself. In the end, such motivation did not sustain me. I slipped beneath the waves, drowning in a welter of Anglo-Saxon phonemes.The second time, I was a teacher, and was thinking of teaching it. I had just finished reading Will and Ariel Durant's _Story of Civilization_, so my reading muscles were unusually fit, and so I prevailed.This book is clever, sure, but that is just not enough. I love games with words, but such delightful shenanigans work best in shorter forms - in poems - or as divertissements or instruments of nuance in longer works, in the service of some literary enterprise worthy unto itself, such as telling a story. That's my view, and I'm sticking to it, since there is so very much else to read, and life is so very short."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I adore James Joyce, but I must report that in this free Kindle version, the chants / songs / quotations are missing!

I own several editions of ULYSSES includingother first edition facsimile editions but this one is by far the most comfortable and readable. While it isn't as visually impressive as the Easton Press edition of the 1922 Paris text, which retained the design and Mattise illustrations of the 1935 Limited Editions Club version, it is rather more practical. The binding is incredible. This book will open flat and stay open on any page, making it an absolute pleasure to read effortlessly. The page size is the same as the first edition and retains the wonderful generous margin size. This edition is remarkable for the understated elegance of its appearance. The cover is bound in beautiful blue buckram that reproduces the look of the original paper wraps of the Shakespeare and Company edition. It contains the original title page/colophon as well as the charming message from Sylvia Beech. Signiture numbers are also present. All of the wonderful and odd typos (including a few upside down letters, a result of the original typesetting process) are present and the feeling is like going back in time and experiencing the greatest novel ever written just as those first readers in 1922 did. When I first took the book out of the box my initial reaction was that it was overpriced but once I started reading it, the magnificent, exceptional quality of the book became quickly apparent. I started reading and finished it in three days, the quickest I've ever gotten through ULYSSES. Reading this edition is such a pleasure that I really didn't want to put it down. The price of the book may seem a little high but I assure you, if you love ULYSSES then you are certain to treasure this spectacular edition. I will never need to buy another reading copy of ULYSSES again. The book is so strong and sturdy that it shows virtually NO sign of wear after the first reading. The binding is strong and tight and superior to just about anything else I have seen in this price range. I am so grateful to Orchisis Press for producing this incredible edition. I love it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course \\"Joyce's Ulysses\\" taught by James A.W.

The reviews apply to Ulysses rather than the 1922 edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce's Ulysses closely parallels the events of Homer's The Odyssey, but this journey is far more surreal than Homer could have ever dreamt. The story is set in one day, and mostly follows the principal character Leopold Bloom going through the day.Ulysses does not follow typical conventions of literature, and therein lies its beauty and its freedom. The text is littered with puns and seemingly nonsensical and comical language, one of the highlights being the section written as a play in which all manner of chaos takes place. This text may at first appear to be senseless but perseverence will reward those who would spend time examining its language, which is often made up of multiple words, each constituent part of which relates to a wider topic. This is, in a sense, a scholalry text, as it is so much more than a story, and you need to have the willingness to at least attempt to understand the broader referential context, much of which I am also working on. If that seems like too much hard work, then I doubt Ulysses would provide much enjoyment to you, although that's not to say it can't be read without additional knowledge. It does help to know some of the things going on in Joyce's mind and the history/culture of his beloved Ireland.The version being reviewed here is by Orchises Press, which is a fantastic reproduction of the very first edition of Ulysses printed by Shakespeare and Company. The binding is quite tight and the print quality superb. There is also plenty of space for literary scholars to scribble notes. As it is a sturdy edition, this is built to last. There is no introduction to the text or any essays, and some may prefer this. For first time readers, it can be better to read the text without any preconceptions, just like people who would have read it when it was first published. The cloth cover on this edition, as others have commented, appears a little greener than the original, but most surviving originals have aged to appear exactly like this anyway. As it so closely resembles a vintage copy, it is a very exciting prospect to read Ulysses in the same way its principal adoptors did in the early 1920s. As it is not a vintage copy, you do not need to worry about being ever so careful. Of course, it is still expensive and it is best to treat it with care, but if you had a 1922 copy, you would probably keep it in a cabinet, trying not to disturb its delicate state. For owners of the original who would love to read their vintage copy, but too afraid to, this may be a great solution. Ordering this from the UK from Amazon, it took about three weeks to arrive here from the US, and it was a really terrific moment when it arrived, removing the clingfilm and starting reading it. It is, as a side note, quite a shame that UK readers do not favour hardback editions of books. It is quite difficult to buy new editions of classic books on hardback, unless of course, you turn to the second hand market. It is just a shame that the UK does not seem to appreciate premeire hardback editions of classic texts. oh well...In many ways the Orchises Press version suits both collectors and serious readers. Of course, it is more expensive than the paperback version, and recommended only to real enthusiasts. For me, this is a definitive edition because literary essays, introductions and annotations mean very little to me, as I like to derive my own impressions by reading and do my own research on specific things. As an MA Comparative Literature student interested in Joyce, I feel this edition can be used for serious research without the supplementary scholarly material because it leaves you free to have just the text and your impressions.If this edition proves too dear, I believe the Modern Library (or was it Everyman's Luibrary) have an edition currently in print and should be available to order from most retail bookstores. I saw a copy in my local Borders for 13.99, and if you are considering getting a decent hardback edition, perhaps you could go for that edition, as the Modern Library has an excellent range of titles and deserves to be supported.To conclude, Joyce had an extraordinary imagination and wonderful command of the English language. He is a master of the English language and this is one of his most captivating work. Personally I prefer Finnegans Wake because if you persevere with it, past the first 100 pages, you find some side-splittingly humourous puns. In any case, I will leave my fondness for Finnegans Wake for another review. For now, grab a copy of Ulysses and enter the bizarre world of Joyce where the ordinary mundane things become surreal adventures, and language becomes so unfamiliar that it begins to start making sense again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How should one read Ulysses at the beginning of the 21st century? The Modern English Library rated James Joyce's magnum opus the greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. Was their judgment correct? Perhaps (though a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man does not fall far behind). However, Joyce's novel, which traces the misadventures of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and then Molly Bloom, is of course an echo of the Odyssey. It is also an affirmation of the Hebraic and Hellenic cultures in the West. But that is not really how it should be read. Ulysses is perhaps even more difficult to comprehend now than it was when it was first published in Paris through the Shakespeare Book Co., because Joyce alludes to modernist Irish literature, art, and architecture with breathtaking speed (though it is still far more cogent than Finnegan's Wake). However, you must read Ulysses, it is a rich cathedral of European artistry, from Joyce's command over the vernacular to his groundbreaking \`stream-of-consciousness' form. The first section of the novel deals with Stephen, and it can be regarded as a kind of carry-over from a Portrait of the Artist (though a bit more accomplished in form), while the middle section deals with Bloom, one of the strongest characters in the history of Western literature, and certainly one of Joyce's greatest achievements. Bloom is the thrust of the novel. He is the middlebrow that bridges Stephen (the intellectual) with Molly (the tramp), and his observations are the most lucid and revealing about the state of civilization at that time and place. But Ulysses is always funny, and moving and beautiful at the same time. The closing of section one ought to illustrate the strange majesty of Joyce's prose: \\"He [Stephen] turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship\\" (51). This curious novel, which unfolds over the course of a single day, will undoubtedly continue to astound and perplex readers and scholars eternally. The way to work your way through Ulysses if it is your first time, is to be mindful of the details; Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated is an excellent resource for a listing and explications of the more arcane allusions in Ulysses. Hugh Kenner's critical book is also a first-rate work of criticism for those who want further explication of the \`meaning' and significance of the work as a whole. For those who are truly courageous, you can begin to look into the Post-Modernist interpretations of Ulysses from fellows like Derrida and DeMan, but you should be wary of them, as they are often more complex than Joyce was to begin with."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Indecipherable rubbish.I bought this door stop because it is on everyone's list of Great Books.

I actually did manage to more or less read it all the way through, in one long twelve hour night, which I can never have back now. And I don't know about all the nuances and subtleties that it supposedly contains, but the basic thrust of it was clear enough.Ulysses is basically an unbridled attack on the very ideas of heroism, romantic love and sexual fulfillment, and objective literary expression. This is made especially clear by the title's reference to The Odyssey of Homer (Ulysses being the Latin name for the Greek Odysseus)---and the unmistakably unbridgeable contrast between the two books, both in terms of the content of the stories, and their modes of expression.Odysseus is a great man, King of Ithaca, husband of Penelope, father of Telemachus, and a hero of the Trojan war. The Odyssey chronicles his heroic ten-year voyage to return home from the war to his wife and son. Ulysses, on the other hand, is about an ordinary day in the life of Leopold Bloom, a bumbling buffoon, impotent both in life and in bed. In Homer's view, man is a heroic, even God-like, being---and woman is more than a match for him. In Joyce's, man is metaphysically ridiculous, especially in matters of sex, and woman is his equal in patheticalness.And then there is the literary style Joyce employs to spew forth this sewage. While Homer's epic poem takes the form of strictly-metered verse, Joyce switches literary mode, from straight prose to dialogue to stream of consciousness (among other things), almost at random throughout the work, though it seems to degenerate more and more toward the end.If the point of Ulysses were to break free of outmoded and arbitrary restrictions of classicism, it would be admirable. But that's not what Joyce is doing. He doesn't offer a positive alternative to replace the Homeric values (which I think are genuine values) upon which he's pissing. He's pissing on them just to piss on them. It's pure nihilism, and it's disgusting.Ulysses is obscene, not because of any language it uses or its obsession with sex, but because of its thematic content---the ideas it conveys. The book expresses nothing less than an all-consuming hatred of man and any positive values to which he aspires. And that is why I think Ulysses is one of the most vile and evil books ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce had sometimes been called a writers writer. One reviewer even suggested we should give Ulysses the benefit of a doubt, for the same reason we uneducated lay-folk use to accept on sight modern physics or Einsteins Relativity theory. Now I can think of all sorts of definitions for the meaning and purpose of imaginative literature -- to serve as the arcane Cabala for the initiates of a secretive cult is not one of them. If a novel lacks what it takes to reach every conceivable kind of reader, regardless whether it is to be received as a pleasure or a nuisance, than it is a failure, plain and simple. I may detest what I read -- even successful novels dont come with a gun held to your head -- but Ulysses is simply an empty shell, nothing left to form an opinion or taste either way. A bad writer is just bad, because he cant cope adequately with his task. But there is also a possibility that I may detest a good writer for the waste of skill and talent on something I deem to be an unworthy or badly misguided effort. So even if I may not like what he has to say, I can still be impressed by the beauty and cogency of his delivery. I dont like it, but the man has something to say, and he says it well. But this here is different: can anybody tell me what else it possibly could be than the vain demonstration of stylistic skills from the portfolio of a great talent -- with absolutely nothing to say? God knows, I am all for a reader who pays to a good authors work the respect it deserves and pitches in a bit of his own effort. This should entitle a good reader to carry home something worthwhile. However it is not just the Ulysses, I got the same impression from the entire work of James Joyce, even from his early poems. Except for a precious few luminous moments (the travel of young Steven in the train compartment, the damp and creeping cold atmosphere on the rugby pitch in the Portrait) it really amounts to little more than an exercise in the rhetorics of imaginative writing. It must be me, but I cant help feeling something amateurish in all this contrived effort. Call Joyce a genius, if you like, we all know he was determined to be remembered as the outstanding writer of the 20th century. And we do! We remember his legend the same way we remember Cervantes or Kafka before we open their books. An aura surrounds Ulysses, and this awe may even carry us through a few passages and purple patches, but thats where the comparison ends. Take away the halo from Cervantes and Kafka and you still enjoy a robust read -- I doubt the same can be said of Joyce. He had the gift, and he knew it, but even his consummate admiration for Ibsen didnt help him to find for himself a story worth telling, that is a story which would make his talent shine and captivate the reader. Technically, Ulysses is a superb piece of narrative engineering. A myriad of leitmotifs and themes entwine, separate and meet again each delivered in a variety of different voices and styles. So, ok, a letter torn to tiny shreds into the river carries to a corresponding theme five chapters later, a piece of soap bought in the morning becomes an important item in late afternoon, a galaxy of town-folks revolve around each other and do their daily chores, though mostly in pubs, hospital-canteens and hostelries -- a tat one-sided should it ever become necessary to reconstruct Dublin from scratch. So our Mr. Bloom masturbates over the sight of a crippled girl -- the joke to write parts of this particular passage in the pseudo-elegant journalese of a turn of the century fashion magazine is lost on me: is it supposed to poke fun on the clich beset thoughts in the poor girls mind? In fact Joyce ventriloquizes a lot; all over the book the English language is taken through her paces like a dressage horse, nobody can deny the authors brilliance, and sometimes he even presents a superb artistic flash, like the gold coins the principle is handing out to Stephen. Yet even here I see the author glancing sideways under his eyelids: are we really looking? Do we catch the moment? (Kafka did such things in his sleep.) So what does all this amount to, on some 800 pages, except to small change? Yes, Ulysses has style, a whole museum of styles to be exact, and nothing but style. After you finish it, if you make it through, you will leave it behind like a confused dream, and forget it just as soon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading &quot;great literature&quot; over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I requested Ulises, Spanish version, which was advertised.Instead, I got an old English version for the price of the Spanish one.I contacted the seller and s/he never had the courtesy of getting back to me.

Modern readers equate the word \\"classic\\" with \\"boring and hard to read.\\" But most classics have risen to that status because they are timeless, powerful and entertaining - Heart of Darkness, War and Peace, and Red Badge of Courage come to mind (all highly readable, by the way). Then there are the novels that have been made famous because of the academic community's inability to distinguish between obscure genius and obscure pretentious pap. Ulysses falls into the latter category.This work has its moments, no question. I actually enjoyed the final hundred pages. Too bad I had to read 900 pages (hardcover version) of intellectual onanism to get to them. Joyce was a talented writer, but trying so stridently to prove that to his readers is just plain arrogant. His prose makes Faulkner look like Crichton. I was able to follow the narrative less than half of the time. Lest you think that has more to do with my intellect (or lack thereof) than bad writing, you should know that I am a well-read, educated person who makes his living as a professional editor. The point is, if a literate audience can't make (any) sense of your work without referring to a 500 page reference book every two minutes, your novel is a failure.Ulysses is a book for people who think a blank white canvas hanging in an art gallery is genius. Fans of Joyce need to read Tom Wolfe's Painted Word before they can have any credibility defending Joyce's &quot;masterpiece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book, it is masterfully written and there is not a word that cannot be explained. The negative reviews for this book are written by people who lack the patience or education to understand it. There are stacks of books written just for these people; The New Bloomsday Book being the best one. This is not an Oprah's Book Club book, it is Serious Literature, and it is unapologetic about it. It's fine to say that you didn't get it or you don't understand it; but to make these silly \\"Emperor's new clothes\\" remarks is a display of ugly ignorance.Ulysses demands something of its reader. You need a real education--not a job-training college degree, but the experience of having engaged the works of history's greatest writers for your own benefit and on your own terms. You need to have read a great breadth of authors in real depth, and you need to have understood them. You need to know what happened in the Odyssey, you need to know a fair bit of history, and you need to have read a wide variety of authors from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Dickens. You need to be well-read enough that you can understand what's going on without flipping back and forth to Cliff Notes.It blows me away that one of the negative reviews mentioned that someone was made to read this book in high school: I don't think you can possibly be well-read enough for it in high school. If you're not a voracious reader, someone who reads quality classic literature for the fun of it, you are not in Joyce's target audience. There's nothing here to entertain you if you can't keep up; Joyce isn't Mark Twain, giving you an entertaining adventure story to divert you if his larger social points go over your head. He wants to push literature into new directions, and he is very demanding.But if you are capable of approaching this book, the rewards are astounding. This book is incredibly great; the language will floor you, the characters are interesting and engaging (to whoever said that the characters aren't developed, what more could you ask for than Leopold Bloom?), and the book is very funny in parts. If you can read it, you'll be glad you read it.And if you can't read it, don't sweat it. Most people can't. There's nothing wrong with that--plenty of great authors are very approachable to less well-read people, and it's just that Joyce isn't one of them. Joyce wasn't trying to be mean, he was just trying to use ALL of his education to try some things that hadn't been done before. Try Dubliners, which is much more straightforward and readable, or even Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce and his readers are not \\"overeducated\\"--and what a silly, ignorant, impossible concept that is anyway!Just don't take this attitude that Ulysses is for boring intellectuals. With this attitude, you are the one being snotty, not the Ulysses readers. This book is capable of getting some people really excited and engaged; respect it for what it is, don't deride it for what it isn't. This is a great book for people who have read most of the other great books; it may not be the great book for you. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A good version of Ulysses, no doubt, but it is still better to go with the Gabler edition.

Mr. Rose claims to have brought the beauty of Joyce's most famous work closer to being appreciated en masse.

Gone are many (there are thousands of revisions) of Joyce's omissions of puctuation, capitalization and other conventions of grammar. There are documented mistakes that Joyce attempted to correct during his lifetime, and three existing editions are far truer to Ulysses as it was intended. There is no reason to subjugate the techniques of James Joyce so people with short attention spans and speciously pedantic (why correct Joyce's purposeful misuse of grammar) leanings can appreciate. If you simply want to know the story buy the Cliff's notes or ask someone who read the book.

It occurred to me that Ulysses is the greatest hoax of the century, ranking with Conan Doyle's Piltdown Man. Surely, Joyce must have realized that Ulysses was the inevitable &amp; fitting conclusion to the Romantic Age.

Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him -- but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that _Ulysses_ might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks. As for L.

It clearly explained the structure of the novel, the personality of the characters - Leopold Bloom ans Stephen Dedalus -, as well as the outline of the plot - a day in the life of these people.The review is very positive. It mentions that it is a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot; and that it is the greatest expression of realism in literature.

I knew the book was famous, considered by many the greatest book of the 20th Century, and I had a vague recollection of having tried to read it when I was still a teenager. Fully conscious and wide-awake I closely read the first 40 or 50 pages. I can't say I don't remember what I read, but I can say I had no idea where the &quot;action&quot; took place, no idea of who was talking, and absolutely clueless to what any of the characters thought. The experience was completely mind-numbing. I then turned to the last chapter, and turned page after page looking for the period at the end of that chapter's opening sentence. I don't know how thorough my scanning was but I believe the whole last chapter, several pages, is one very long sentence.Joyce is an aesthetic bother of Marcel Duchamp (known for The Fountain, a urinal, now a museum piece) and John Cage (the composer of pieces for prepared piano, where the piano's strings are mangled with trash. He also is the &quot;composer&quot; of violin piece where the performer goes through the motions of playing without making a sound. I don't know if Amazon's audio capabilities can capture the nuance of that piece.) In this &quot;club&quot; we have a composer who writes noise or silence, an artist who exhibits a toilet, and a writer who is incomprehensible...long may they rest in peace.Two positive things I can say about James Joyce is that he has a great sounding name and he gives wonderful titles to his works."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I spent months to read this crappy novel, hailed by modern pseudo-intellectuals as 20th century best (maybe because they are so close to its flimsy thoughtless characters and broken up narration -typical to Post-Modernist 'masterpieces'-). Although better and more sincere compared to its modern literary heirs, Ulysses still is in no way capable to elude its very nature. The thoroughly unreadable ramblings found inside are under no circumstance manifestations of artistic rebellion, being in fact just excuses coming from extraordinarily self-indulgent authors.Of course, some non-indoctrinated people could object and say: this book portrays well Dubliner &quot;middle&quot; society from ITS OWN perspective (not from a critical eye). However, I don't think this was author's intent. His intent was just &quot;getting rebelious&quot;: being &quot;new&quot;, unbounded by (older) rules and responsibility.Why two stars, then?

I'm sure it has tons of allegorical layers but whats the good of that when you can't tell what the hell is even going on.It seems that for a book to be considered great it has to have layers of meanings hidden that are very hard to figure out. But I'm sure that half of these &quot;great&quot; books are written with a meaning intended by the author and then the critics and readers assume that there is some great meaning behind everything so they make up something just to make sure they don't look stupid.

I mean to say that it is a surprisingly civilized discussion between two strongly opposing points of view. At no point, however, does their strong disagreement with each other ever impinge upon their deep friendship. Now, this correspondence isn't complete in this edition. Our editor explains that besides the purposefully excluded period between \\"January 1850 and April 1852 which are of somewhat less importance than the others since they mostly comprise Gobineau's lengthy accounts about Switzerland - all hitherto (1956) available letters are included in this volume. (p. 179-180, editor's 'Note on Gobineau'.)\\" I believe that it is thought that even today that some letters of Tocqueville have yet to be published. The letters themselves go from page 188 to page 336 in this specific edition. It is the 38 late letters that range from 1852 to 1859, and at that only the ones that most especially contain the discussion of their disagreements regarding race and history, that will concern us here. Now, exactly what did Tocqueville find so objectionable?But before we get to that, please allow me a few more words on this specific book, especially since it seems to be long out of print. Besides this correspondence, it contains the material that would have eventually made its way into a second volume of Tocqueville's \\"The Old Regime and the French Revolution\\". That second volume was never finished. Nor is all the material found in Tocqueville's manuscripts and notes intended for this unattained second volume publshed here. The specific book here being reviewed was published in 1959 and John Lukacs was the editor, translator, and he also provided a useful Introduction and the 'Note on Gobineau' quoted above. Now, some might wonder how it makes sense to publish these two seemingly disparate texts in one book. Our editor explains that while the first volume of Tocqueville's 'The Old Regime and the French Revolution', \\"illuminates the scene of France, in the second volume his illustrations begin to spread out from France, first of all to Germany;\\" but \\"their ultimate concern is civilized Europe. I know that the most inspiring expressions of his philosophic propositions about the prospects of that Europe may be found in his correspondence with Gobineau. The complementary connection should, I think, justify the combination of these two separate parts of the Tocquevillean heritage in this volume. (p. 7, Introduction)\\" This is also, in part, why Lukacs' chose to title these texts \\"The European Revolution\\" and not 'The Old Regime and the French Revolution, Volume II'.Now, on to the correspondence between Tocqueville and Gobineau, and the criticism of the latter by the former. Tocqueville denies that racial appearances tell us, scientifically, very much at all. \\"Thus, despite their very different forms, bulldogs and lapdogs successfully mate, while horses and donkeys, similar to the point of potential visual confusion, are unable to produce but the seedless mule. (Tocqueville, May 1852, p.2 22)\\" So, mere appearance tells us that bulldogs and lapdogs are quite disparate, while it tells us that horses and donkeys are almost the same. Genuine science, however, draws a far different conclusion. But science aside, it was always the political and spiritual consequences of Gobineau's views that Tocqueville feared most. \\"...I confess that after having read your book I remain, as before, opposed in the extreme to your doctrines. I believe that they are probably quite false, I know that they are certainly very pernicious. (Tocqueville, November 1853, p. 227).\\" Oh, they are very dangerous indeed. Eighty years after this letter an admirer of Gobineau, Adolf Hitler, would come to power...Another problem that Tocqueville had with Gobineau is his 'materialistic' understanding of history. \\"Do you really believe that by tracing the destiny of peoples along these lines you can truly clarify history? And that our knowledge about humans becomes more certain as we abandon the practice followed since the beginning of time by the many great minds who have searched to find the cause of human events in the influence of certain men, of certain emotions, of certain thoughts, and of certain beliefs? (Tocqueville, November 1853, p. 228.)\\" Tocqueville, we must recall, was a very great historian in his own right, whose writings anticipate the famous 'sociological' turn of the last century. Regarding Tocqueville's 'sociological history', Lukacs (also a historian) says, \\"it has become more and more obvious that, with the social and democratic character of our age, the requirements of historiography have changed, that it is no longer possible to concentrate exclusively on the actions of leading protagonists of the politically active classes, that it is less and less possible to separate what Faguet called 'surface' history from what lies 'beneath' it. And this Tocqueville already knew. (p. 11, Introduction.)\\"So, Tocqueville opposes Gobineau's racism and materialism. What else? Well, Tocqueville says of the pessimism and determinism that he finds in Gobineau, \\"your book supports these tendencies: despite yourself, it promotes the spiritual lassitude of your already weakening contemporaries. (Tocqueville, December 1853, p. 232.)\\" Three years later we find him hammering home the same point again. \\"A book which tries to prove that men in this world are merely obeying their physical constitutions and that their will power can do almost nothing to influence their destinies is like opium given to a patient whose blood has already weakened. (Tocqueville, January 1856, p. 270).\\" But our editor correctly reminds us (Introduction, p. 6) that Tocqueville was no mere enlightened optimist, \\"his judicious criticism of the false optimism about human nature...\\" intimates that there might be some small agreement between our correspondents - regarding pessimism, that is. ...Well, perhaps.Now, Gobineau really does not argue this point, \\"I am not telling people: 'You are acquitted' or 'You are condemned'; I tell them: 'You are dying'. (Gobineau, March 1856. p. 284).\\" Later, in the same letter, to the same European Civilization he says, \\"Establish kingdoms, dynasties, republics, whatever you want; these things may be possible. I am not opposing you. Go disturb the Chinese in their home, polish off the Turks, drag the Persians into your schemes; these things may be possible and even inevitable. I shall not contradict you, but in the final account, the causes of your enervation are gathering and they will continue to gather by these very actions.(p. 285)\\" As you can see, there really is no 'white race triumphalism' here. However, the very next sentence shows his contempt for all others: \\"And no one in the world will replace you when your degeneration is completed.\\" About this last sentence, obviously, one can have severe and serious doubts...Now, why should this 150 year old correspondence be of the slightest interest in our postmodern times? Well, my concern is this: in the nineteenth century devotion to the Christian faith, in Europe most especially, was waning. And Christianity was at that time in the process of being replaced by two very different secular world-views. One was 'scientific' socialism, the other was 'scientific' racism. Both claimed to be modern and scientific and historical while also claiming that the several different religious doctrines then extant were merely old and superstitious and traditional. ...But how does all that concern us today? After all, 'really-existing' socialism has fallen and the 'really-existing' racism that first appeared (as theory) with it fell even earlier at the end of WWII. But my suspicion, my fear, is that with the recent disappearance of socialism, the many people disenchanted with our postmodern capitalist world but immune to the blandishments of traditional religion will eventually find their way back to the racialist camp.This brings us to another major point that I wanted to make and that our editor underlines regarding Tocqueville's letters in the final period (1852 - 1859). It is the seriousness of his commitment to Christianity. According to our editor, Tocqueville once wrote,\\"I cannot believe that God has for several centuries been pushing two or three hundred million men toward equality just to make them wind up under a Tiberian or Claudian despotism. Verily, that wouldn't be worth the trouble. Why He is drawing us toward democracy, I do not know; but embarked on a vessel that I did not build, I am at least trying to use it to gain the nearest port. (Editor's Introduction, p. 28, an unsourced quote, of which I was disappointed to find that there are several in this edition. From something I saw on the internet I believe this quote originates from Tocqueville, \\"Oeuvres Compl&egrave;tes\\", V, (1), p. 289. If anyone knows any different please leave a comment.)\\" It may, or may not, be fair to think of Tocqueville as a pessimist regarding human activity, but he never thought this of the human spirit. His faith prevented that.I will permit myself one more Tocquevillean quote regarding God; that is, the spirit of Christianity. He asks Gobineau, \\"is it not its unique trait to have abolished those racial distinctions which the Jewish religion still retained and to have made therefrom but one human race, all of whose members are equally capable of improving and uniting themselves? (Tocqueville, January 1857, p. 305)\\". Yes, that was the heart of the matter for me while I read this book. With the contemporary evaporation of socialism, the continuing enervation of Christianity, universalism no longer has a vital position amongst people in the Western world. And among our 'elites'? - It is even worse; postmodern particularist nihilism continues to work its way through the Academy. Regarding the importance of universalism, I am in the habit of saying that if one reads the philosophers as Spinoza read the Bible, noting where the sources agree and excluding all else, one is left with two points only: the philosophical struggle towards universalism, the philosophical war against nihilism. ...But where is the universalism in our postmodern world?And those were the concerns that stayed with me as I read this text. Now, in closing, I do not want to leave the impression that I found the text to the never-finished second volume on the 'Old Regime' uninteresting. Far from it. Actually, I enjoyed it more than the published volume. It concentrates on the Revolutions consequences for all Europe, and therefore the world. But this review had another focus. Now, as our editor points out, both the correspondence between Tocqueville and Gobineau and the historical material included here are interested in our future and not merely our past. Regarding this, and pertinent to the direction of this review, Tocqueville, in the course of explaining the rise of Napoleon, will say:\\"The parties themselves, decimated, apathetic, and weary, longed to rest for a time during a dictatorship of any kind, provided only that it was exercised by an outsider and that it weighed upon their rivals as much as on themselves. This feature completes the picture. When great political parties begin to cool in their attachments without softening their hatreds, and at last reach the point of wishing less to succeed than to prevent the success of their opponents, one should prepare for servitude--the master is near.\\" (Tocqueville, The Revolution, Book III, chapter II, p. 138 - 139)When political parties cease to believe in anything but their very real hatred for their enemies, 'the master is near'. My God! It really is too often forgotten how effectively the sober Tocqueville could play the part of prophet! 'The master is near.' ...I fear that this is more and more becoming the situation in these United States. On the one hand we have two extremely antagonistic parties, that when in power, behave in an almost homogeneous manner. And, on the other hand, an electorate growing ever more disgusted with the temperature and torpor of national politics. This is a recipe for disaster, as Tocqueville well knew. To his credit, Gobineau is not blind to these particular considerations, \\"it is from above that inspiration and direction are fated to descend to the people: and when in these spheres of authority there no longer is any belief, no more confidence, no more will, no striving for the good and the better, one may state with all the certainty of a mathematical proposition that power will fall to the first corporal who, in passing, will seize it. ( from 'A Note on Gobineau', p. 187, This Gobineau quote is from a surprisingly unnamed 'posthumously published essay' of 1870.) That corporal, who Gobineau would have loathed, was Adolf Hitler.Loathed? Yes, loathed. The war between France and Germany would have horrified him and Gobineau was never a raving anti-semite. No? \\"And what did the Jews become, in this miserable corner of the earth? They became a people that succeeded in everything it undertook, a free, strong, and intelligent people, and one which, before it lost, sword in hand, the name of an independent nation, had given as many learned men to the world as it had merchants. (Gobineau, \\"The Inequality of Human Races\\", NY, 1915, p. 59)\\" So you see, there are vast differences in degree even between the various 'racialist' ideologies.All in all I found both parts of this book, the history and the correspondence, very satisfying reads. This review focused on the controversy between Tocqueville and Gobineau as revealed in the correspondence between them. It would take another review to even begin to deal with the issues raised in the essays gathered here as the 'European Revolution'."},{"Title":"The European Revolution & Correspondence with Gobineau","review":"There is less of the correspondence than I would have imagined.

Some fare well, others don't prosper. This is what makes Jo's Boy's somewhat somber in nature. Alcott notes the passing of Marmee, and others depart as well. A sadder tale, and a bittersweet end to the saga of the March family. A funny tidbit is the appearance of fans to bother Mother Bhaer (Jo). Alcott afflicts her alter-ego with the same annoyances that the fans created for her after Little Women. One uninvited admirer even cadges a postage stamp from her desk.

Emil has a most remarkable adventure on the high seas that will remind many of classic sailing tales in the 19th century. Nan is interested in medicine and little else. Demi turns out to be spoiled. Daisy is patiently waiting for her love to return.By this time, Louisa May Alcott had become identified more closely with Women's Rights, and Jo's Boys is in some ways a tract piece to advance the cause of equal opportunity for women. I was struck by how modern many of the views are, although the way they are expressed is definitely from the 19th century.She also takes herself more seriously as a writer and enriches the text with references that may not be familiar to many readers.

I had vaguely favorable memories of Jo's Boys from childhood, so decided to read it again on my Kindle. What a half-hearted effort this is! Except for one entertaining chapter in which Jo tries to escape a horde of fans, she's lost all her character. No longer is she the headstrong girl of the first book, or even the comforting \\"Mother Bhaer\\" of Little Men. Instead, she spends the entire book preaching. Long, LONG passages are taken up with her lecturing. Of course Alcott was always preachy, but in this book it's taken to an almost ludicrous extreme.Otherwise, there are too many characters, and few of them are adequately developed. The standouts are Dan, Jo's \\"black sheep,\\" and the \\"lost at sea\\" episode involving Emil. The rest of it is dull as dishwater, punctuated with duller lectures on women's rights and endless literary and mythological references.The only thing I did like about this story is that Amy and Mr. Bhaer have faded into the background, and Jo and Laurie seem to spend much of their time together. It's almost enough to make one think that Alcott regretted her choice to not put those characters together-- or perhaps she simply realized that Laurie and Jo work best on paper together, and have an undeniable chemistry that the other pairings lack.Regardless, Laurie and Jo aren't enough to save this one. Stick with the other Alcott stories, and leave this one on the electronic shelf."},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"I read through the book, yet found it confusing and hard to understand.

If you read it, watch the movie, it is AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"For \\"Jo's Boys\\", which she intended to be the last in her series about the March family, Louisa May Alcott pulled out all the stops. It is with great fanfare that the beloved characters of former books make their last appearance.All sorts of incredible developments are described in the course of the novel--and some of them fairly stretch the imagination. My favorite is the \\"emigration\\" of the whole extended family to Plumfield: Meg has a house close by, Laurie and Amy have a mansion on an adjacent hill, and even Mr. March and Mr. Laurence have become neighbors to the school. Of course, this and all the rest make the story more fun . . . but I miss the old subtlety.The school itself has become a college--a convenient twist that allows the characters from \\"Little Men\\" to still be in the same area years after they ought to have moved away. Though not all the Plumfield students make a second appearance, Alcott's famous favorites remain.A decade later, Demi is having trouble deciding on a career and declaring himself to a certain young lady. Tommy is in pursuit of his childhood sweetheart, Nan, who has vowed to be a spinster for life. Nat is sent to Germany, far away from his beloved Daisy, for musical training. Emil is shipwrecked, Dan tangles with the law, and young Ted gets into scrapes worthy of his namesake's youth. There is enough \\"lovering\\" and \\"spooning\\" here to make up for the lack in \\"Little Men\\", but some characters brought in for the romance are ex machina.\\"Jo's Boys\\" is also agonizingly preachy. I don't just mean the campaigning for women's suffrage and against alcohol, but also all the sermonizing about mastering one's faults, appreciating others' virtues, testing the strength of love by waiting, etc. Mrs. March's three surviving daughters try their best, but they cannot equal her talent for lecturing without putting people to sleep. The story positively drags when the moralizing begins.At least no one has to forsake his or her castle in the air, this time around. Even though Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie had to give up their artistic aspirations, being deficient in \\"genius,\\" the next generation of dreamers does not suffer the same fate. Few of them are made to \\"grow out of\\" whatever made them so wonderful during childhood.

But although Jo still worries over her flock and continues to moralize, she does come to the realization that there is only so much a mother can do, before letting her children go off into the world alone and trust that they will remember everything they've been taught.While this book brings with it the characteristic bustle and color of the previous two, there is also a certain sadness. It's apparent that Plumfield reached its height during the years the Bhaers' children were small, and a certain emptiness rings throughout the pages. I felt almost as sad as though I were bidding farewell to real friends, never to see them again; but simultaneously, it's a sign of a true writer when someone can make you feel that way."},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the sermons. This book is even more littered with preaching than Little Men and Little Women, and that's saying something. Probably a good 20% of this book is skip-worthy for that reason.Alcott was always prone to littering her works with literary and artistic references (calling Amy \\"Raphael,\\" and whatnot), but she seems to have gone dramatically overboard in this book, with references to almost all of Goethe's various fictional characters, George Eliot, Charlotte Bronte, Florence Nightingale, \\"Miss Cobbe\\" and \\"Miss Phelps\\" [?], and more, and more, and more. There are a lot of currently-understandable Shakespearean references, but a lot of the references are to obscure or long-forgotten people. It seems more like active name-dropping or literary snobbery [i.e., \\"Look how many literary references I can pack into my books!\\"] than actually adding to the story.Otherwise, the followups are good; it's interesting to learn about how she perceived her characters at ten years older...though Teddy, and his cousin Jo (Baby Josie in \\"Little Men\\"), have turned out to be clones of the original Jo, practically. Overall, this book is not really a worthy effort. But read it if you need continuity and closure."},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"This is a great children's books- I think it scores low with many Alcott readers however because although it is generally good, it is not GREAT like her other books.As the third of the \\"Little Women\\" books (1: \\"Little Women\\", 2: \\"Little Men\\"), \\"Jo's Boys\\" features the children of the original March sisters, now grown up themselves and having their own issues of romance and careers. The books of this series are all appropriate reading for young teens.Some people say the moralizing in this book is more than the others- but Alcott put a great deal of cautionary tales in all three. Still, a sweet story and anyone who has read the first two will definitely want to read the last."},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"This book is a sequel to Little Men and is about the same characters. The childish bond between both the boys and girls has been replaced with a stronger bond of affection. Little Josie has finally grown and wants to be an actor, little Ted has his friend, but will Nat truly be able to marry Daisy? The childish affection has turned into real love, but will it always remain? Will Dan get out of jail? If not, what will happen to him? All these questions will be answered. This book takes the lives of all the characters in Little Men and goes until the end of their youth. BUT BEWARE, THIS BOOK CANNOT BE READ WITHOUT FIRST READING LITTLE MEN. This will be appropriate for children, but I recommend it more around the age of 10 and 11. I myself read it when I was 8 or 9, but I understand it better when I read it now. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"This being the conclusion to the March family sagas..i'm sorry to say didn't &quot;thrill&quot; me as much as the other two installments.

It's a very good book however and i would reccomend it to anyone who needs closure."},{"Title":"Jo's Boys (Library Edition)","review":"Well, it certainly can't compare with Little Women or Little Men, but it is still a good read.

Coverage of Mediterranean seafaring cultures is educational and unbiased. African and Indian trade and Portuguese intrusion was new to me. the story telling style made it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Running Away to Sea: Round the World on a Tramp Freighter","review":"Running Away to Sea attempts to take the reader on an around the world journey. While I'm sure Douglas Fetherling made the actual trip, he left the reader at home.Mr. Fetherling has done his research on all the places he visits. He knows, and relates, the history and recent political climates of the countries, islands, and areas he passes through on his round the world trip. He spends comparitively little time describing his trip and the people he meets aboard and ashore. When I picked up this book I expected some real escapism. To have my imagination transported to the far away places that I daydream about. Sub-titled, Around the World on a Tramp Steamer, I was ready to relax while I leaned on the starboard rail and watched the world go by. I was ready for adventure and unforgettable characters. Unfortunately I got a history and current events lesson. This is, of course a well written book by a seasoned author. It just wasn't what I expected."},{"Title":"Running Away to Sea: Round the World on a Tramp Freighter","review":"It's always been a mystery to me how someone who is writing a book in which he is the main character, can make that character (himself) come off as unlikeable or seriously unpleasant. After all, as the author you do have a certain amount of control over the character, if not over your actual self.The idea behind Douglas Fetherling's book is irresistible: an adult runs away from home by taking a round-the-world trip on a small freighter. Who hasn't fantasized about leaving home, family, and responsibilities, even if just for a while? And the set-up is full of possibilities: a sullen Russian crew, about a dozen other passengers with various backgrounds, and stops in any number of exotic places. Top it off with some kind of an epiphany for our hero and voila!But Fetherling has taken all these possibilities and apparently refused to improve on what really happened. Because what we end up with is an anti-social hero who despises all his shipmates. He admits that he is having trouble with the idea of becoming a grandfather soon, still in his late forties. He has never really liked being married, he declares (and evidently doesn't care what his wife thinks about him announcing that to the world). The constant vibration of the ship's engine makes him feel perpetually \\"goatish.\\"Fetherling is generous with his research, though, and each port of call gets us a history lesson. It would have been fun to read more about his adventures in port, even if he had to make some of them up.When he finally returns home, he announces to his wife that he has decided to stay with her for now, evidently resigned to becoming a grandfather. But I wonder if his wife was any more impressed than the reader. And I wonder if any of the other passengers or crew has written their own book about the voyage. It still seems like a great idea for a book."},{"Title":"Running Away to Sea: Round the World on a Tramp Freighter","review":"I found Running Away to Sea somewhat patronizing toward the reader, but still readable. Fetherling obviously looks at the world through glasses that are skewed to the political left. I'll wager Gore Vidal is one of his favorite authors. I envision Fetherling as a type of mildly depressed, chic-left, middle-aged, pseudo-intellectual ex-hippie who, if the truth were known, must grudgingly concede that the continuing demise of Communism has left us all far better off. His not so subtle put downs of every nationality except his own (Canadian) are particularly irritating. Being a good liberal, he is quick to advertise his holier-than-thou disdain for racism, but I find his arrogant and condescending attitude towards the French, British, and (especially) Americans to be a mild form of prejudice in itself. Too much of the book involves development of historical background for the ports his ship visits - a fact compounded by irritating editorializing from his socialist perspective. Still, the book flows well, and the reader anxiously anticipates each new chapter. I would buy Running Away to Sea again."},{"Title":"Running Away to Sea: Round the World on a Tramp Freighter","review":"I read the negative reviews of this book (as posted by other amazon readers) but bought it anyway and I'm glad that I did. I've not finished it yet, but am thoroughly enjoying it. I am Canadian so perhaps my views are as *skewed* as the author's, however, I've also travelled extensively and feel that my views are not much different from the rest of the world's!The one comment that I'd agree with is that I wish the author had spent more time on his \\"personal journey\\". I wanted this book because I seem to be at the same life-stage as the author was when he ran away to sea, and I was seeking that type of information/re-assurance.That said, I'm enjoying the tales that he is presenting and find them totally plausible: that one could end up at sea with a dozen or so other people with whom one has nothing in common; and for whom one might even feel a little bit of disdain.The historic and geographic information, as well as general information about the running of the ship, is also interesting to me - but then I have a couple degrees in History and am naturally inclined to seek out such information.Anyway, this is my first ever amazon review and I felt that I had to counter some of the other voices. I am enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Running Away to Sea: Round the World on a Tramp Freighter","review":"It amazes me how an accomplished writer can make a wonderful idea for a book into such a boring tale. Many years ago I spent 3weeks on a tramp freighter travelling between Africa and North America. Because of my own experiences I really looked forward to reading this yarn and was extremely disappointed. There are meager descriptions of his own experiences and one gets the feeling that he (Mr. Fetherling) should have stayed home and spared us what I felt to be a chore in finishing this book. His ship docks at many exotic and alluring ports in the Pacific but amazingly he really has no adventurous experiences himself. He relies on others for his chronicles. Spare yourself the boredom and look for your sea tales elsewhere."},{"Title":"Running Away to Sea: Round the World on a Tramp Freighter","review":"I picked this up because it had a great premise. The book, however, did not live up its title or subject. There was quote after descriptive qoute from other authors about the far away places that Mr. Fetherling touched and some of the historical references were inciteful, but there just wasn't much meat concerning what the author saw and felt during HIS journey. He shyed away from the other passangers and it doesn't seem that he was friendly with the crew. His acount makes it seem like he took up space and made use of the oxygen around him for four months. His trip and the divorce that it probably contributed to was a bit on the depressing side. This is not why I read travel/adventure literature."},{"Title":"Adversary in the house","review":"Eugene V. Debs is the only prisoner who ever ran for president of the U.S.!!He got about a million votes too! He was convicted by the U.S. government under the espionage act and sentenced to 10 years.The title is very telling and I interpret as being a fulfillment of scripture even if Mr. Stone didn't intend it to be. Read Daniel Chapter 2, especially verses 40-45. Daniel is able to interpret a dream by Nebuchadnezzar which no one else could do. Read verse 43 especially. Many peoples would intermix through marriage. Marriage is a great medium through which one can prey upon their enemies. Yes, I wished Debs would have married Gloria, his childhood sweetheart.I've read several of Irving Stone's books and loved every one of them. He, like Michener, will not only tell a good story but will educate you in the process. Both authors go to GREAT lengths to research their subjects. At times, their books can be tiresome, at least to me, because of so much information that is unfamiliar. But I am a slow reader who will not skim past the details.The book is dear to my heart because both my paternal grandfather and greatgrandfather were railroad engineers. My grandfather was born in 1894 and given the name Charles Debs Lumm. Most railroaders absolutely loved Eugene V. Debs. He was a tireless worker, defender of worker's rights. He helped establish the 8 hour work day and managed to organize the railroad workers so that they would no longer be subject to the railroad companies' whims. Many engineers and firemen were disabled for life or tragically killed in train wrecks in the early days of rail. The cost, financially, for the families so affected, so many, many times, would utterly impoverish them. Debs laid the groundwork for unions and insurance practices from those circumstances. However, I'm not so sure he would approve of the current state of those businesses today.Debs' socialism was probably not the same as the socialism of today. At the turn of the century, there were populist/socialist movements all over the world.Railroad, for good or ill, transformed American society. This book is a good one to read about a significant man who lived during an interesting chapter of railroad history, who may have composed most of that small chapter himself."},{"Title":"Adversary in the house","review":"I read this many years ago and it has remained with me ever since. It is a fascinating recounting of Mr. Debbs' lifelong battle for better treatment of workers, especially with the Pullman company, which was evil in its total disregard for the health and welfare of its workers. He ultimately formed the first union. He also was the first Socialist to run for president. The Adversary of the title was his wife who hated what he did and fought him every step of the way. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Adversary in the house","review":"This book is an excellent reminder of what we owe to those who led the early labor movements, and what our lives might have been like if they had not the foresight and fortitude. Debs was a saint. Coincidentally, I next read The Last Station by Jay Parini. I could not help thinking what great friends Tolstoy and Debs would have been and how they both blazed a trail of thought that changed the world for the better."},{"Title":"Adversary in the house","review":"Though the first few chapters took some time..the rest of the book was really AMAZING. I have read a lot of books by the same author but have found this one to be one of his best.While reading the book, i did wish that Mr Debbs would distance himself from Socialism - which he finally came to believe in- but then towards the end, it was clear that it was a different kind of socialism that he was interested in. Also, i wish he had married Gloria instead of Kate; that way, both Kate and Eugene would have had happier private lives. It was also heartening to see Gloria stand up for Eugene through his ordeals- when his wife refused to oblige.All this makes for an interesting read, especially since history is fused so well with his private life. I would strongly recommend this book to those interested in reading real good stuff; the other attraction being its reality."},{"Title":"Adversary in the house","review":"Though the first few chapters took some time..the rest of the book was really AMAZING.

It's about Jamie, a mute boy who lives with his sisters and widowed father in the hollows of Appalachia. The boy feels like he can't do anything and isn't special in any way, until Christmastime, when a teacher offers him a chance to be a shepherd in the school Christmas pageant. This is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to him. But then the pageant is cancelled because of a blizzard, destroying his dream.In the end, a poor, traveling couple appear. The woman is about to have a baby, and they are looking for any place, even a barn, to spend the night, but so far no one has had any room for them (Sound familiar?) Jamie's family gives them shelter, the woman has her baby, and finally Jamie gets his chance to be a shepherd -- he shows up in costume to bring the new baby a gift, and to speak his very first words. A Christmas miracle!One of the things I love most about this book is the fact that Jamie is far from a perfect little boy, but the author obviously loves him and makes us love him and recognize that his anger and tantrums come from frustration over his handicap. No one yells at Jamie and tells him to behave. They find ways to help him behave. There is a Christian spirit of love and generosity coursing through Rebecca Caudill's portrait of this child.An earlier reviewer was offended by how &quot;unrealistic&quot; the ending seemed. I don't think that's really true. Early in the book, Jamie's father talks to a doctor, who tells him that Jamie is physically capable of speaking, but he needs help learning to do so, help the family can not afford. Jamie's inability to speak seems to be more a matter of trauma (his mother died giving birth to him) than anything physical, and so it does not seem remotely unrealistic for him to be healed when something in his life gives him a sense of importance. He simply has to speak to this miraculous child!But more than that, this is a Christmas story. And if we can't make room in a Christmas story for miracles, when can we?"},{"Title":"A certain small shepherd","review":"this book has been an annual christmas favorite with my 11 children. It teaches a strong message of patient waiting for prayers to be answered.The young boy is unable to speak but through his father learns how to love others as the Savior would.

The book creates a setting for a young boy who is not able to talk, who is suddenly able to speak after six years of silence. The book portrays a Christmas story. I would not use this in my classroom, only because it is so unreal. Being a special education major has made me see that a book about a child with a disability needs to be straight forward. These children are just like anyone else. This book, however, does not show that and seems unreal."},{"Title":"A certain small shepherd","review":"This book is a family favorite.

Some years later, this ragged and torn copy of the original edition was sent to me by an acquaintance, and I don't remember why. I do remember phoning her to thank her, and she said that she knew I would take care of this story.As I was moving books around my personal library, I found this copy tucked in between a few other books. So, curious as I am, I picked it up and sat with it on a dreary sunless afternoon, one January.The story of this family takes place in a rural area of the country where the names of places make them sound almost imaginary. However, if you were to check an atlas of the United States, you would find rural names of cities and towns speckled all over the map. There are names like Pine Mountain, Big Black Mountain, and Hurricane Gap, even Line Fork Creek. We aren't going to study about how these towns and places were named, but we are going to meet this special family of four, a father and his three children who have survived past the mother's death, shortly after the baby's birth, one cold November night.Jamie is the baby, now six years old, and he's never spoken. His two sisters guide him in a lot of things, and his Father, he's the hero. He's the hero because he never gives up on Jamie. He has Jamie with him all the time, as he farms his property, feeds the animals, as he drives into town for supplies, as he cuts down overgrown trees. Always together, Father and child, Jamie helped his Dad. The two sisters did household chores, and tended to Jamie when the Dad asked them to.Once Jamie is ready for school, difficulties arise, because Jamie doesn't talk and he has no way to get his point across. The father takes him to a doctor, and that seems of no help. So, the Father enrolls him in school, and even though Jamie doesn't talk, the teacher has him draw certain words and feelings. It's sort of a communication system. As the children in the class prepare for the Christmas play, to be performed at the church, Jamie is given the responsibility of being a shepherd. The Father asks one of the girls to sew a robe of many colors for Jamie, while he trims a broken limb from a tree and turns it into a shepherd's crook.Jamie seems to be content \\"just being a shepherd\\"; he personalizes his role, and on the day when the play is to be performed, a blizzard hits the town, and all is cancelled. Still, Jamie sits in his shepherd's garb, waiting for his role to perform. Disappointed, Jamie is sad and disappointed because the show is cancelled.Late that night, he and his father look out the window and see a couple, on foot, struggling, as they walk outside. When they come to the door, Jamie's Father makes the effort to invite them to stay the night in the barn, and provides warm blankets for them. You see, the couple had tried other homes, but no one had room for them to stay. That night, the Father is in the barn with the couple, late. When Jamie goes to see what is happening, he is startled, and runs back to get his shepherd's crook and robe. Wearing it, he runs back to the barn, carrying some things for the couple, a dime for the lady, an orange for the baby, and he hurries into the barn and says, \\"Here's a Christmas gift for the child\\" and something for you, he says to the woman.Jamie is speaking, finally, and everyone feels blessed. So, you never know; someday, you may witness a Christmas Miracle in your own life."},{"Title":"A certain small shepherd","review":"A heartwarming story that takes you back to the true meaning of Christmas.

This book gives a detailed explanation of the logic behind procedures (normal, abnormal, emergency) in jet aircraft, and discusses them in a very easy to understand manner; excellent for beginners and those transitioning to advanced systems, as well as for those going for re-currency training. I would highly recommend this book, along with another book published by ASA: \\"The Turbine Pilot's Flight Manual,\\" which in turn discusses the advanced systems in a turbine aircraft."},{"Title":"Fly the Wing","review":"This is a great book.

This book has no peer.Jim Webb makes this information come alive and makes often difficult to grasp (or remember) concepts like weather and aircraft performance second nature. I have instructed in many models of jet transports, and when I can't find an answer to a tough question, I never fail to refer to my well used copy of &quot;Fly The Wing.&quot; Many of Webb's examples reference information specific to the DC-9 and L-1011, but understand that the general points being made translate equally well to all commercial jets. As a side note, I have been to school on both the DC-9 and L-1011, and Webb's information is as good as gold, which reinforced the solidness of the underlying text for me.If you are a turbine pilot now or have any interest at all in becoming one, this book is absolutely indispensable to have on your bookshelf. If you are a student, private, or new commercial pilot, this book has loads of accessible, relevant, and important information for you. Don't worry about the turbine specific information and you will still find this a most worthwhile book to read. No pilot should be without it!"},{"Title":"Fly the Wing","review":"&quot;Be your own greatest critic. Accept each flight as a challenge. . . .

It covers every major topic in great detail. So, for the information alone, the book is worth the price. I also heavily recommend this book for experienced pilots and/or instructors.On the downside, there are many misspellings and incorrect assumptions. On multiple occasions, I found the text referring to the ATP Certificate as an ATR, using FFA instead of FAA, using 'their' instead of 'they're,' and so on. I find these disturbing to the reading, but others may not. One incorrect assumption was the author saying 'all airlines perform XYZ...' Well, an airline for which I have flown in the past did not perform XYZ.I find 90% of this book and included CD-ROM to be useful. However, for a text book (which it calls itself on the back cover), there is some serious editing that needs to be done. Also, I would recommend the new author update much of the material for today's more modern aircraft. Some of the aircraft and examples in the book are very outdated.

The other main character and teacher is Ann Sullivan, who never pressured Helen into doing something. Their relationship began to change with time. They became good friends and instead of Anne teaching Helen, they learned from each other.My final thoughts on this book are, she should have written about her whole life instead of writing about her life until she was twenty. I didn't like the second half of this book because it was all letters. It shows her true writing but it's not exciting or interesting.

If her parents haven't have been rich she would have not gone to college. In one of the letters she is like, \\"What animal are you getting me for my birthday? I already have horses, cats, dogs,\\" and God knows what other animals. and she was always whining but I am sure that is because she didn't know any better. But I hated this book so much. I wanted to rip it inot shreds as I read it. I am not even beginning to explain how much I hated it."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The book gave the impression that the author could see and hear, when in fact, she could do neither.

Feeling sorry for oneself after learning that Ms Keller overcame deafness and blindness, and went on to graduate from Radcliffe College (conquering the Harvard curriculum including Greek, Latin, German, French, Geometry, Algebra, Science, English History, English Literature, and many other erudite subjects) is a bit silly when one considers a typical night in our New Millennium spent on the sofa eating Domino's Pizza and watching &quot;American Idol&quot;... *sigh*. But hey, if WE had a private tutor like Anne Sullivan, spending her whole life communicating the outside world to us by spelling into our hand with the manual alphabet, there's no telling what WE might accomplish TOO!...wait a minute, who am I kidding? Helen Keller was not only a brilliant pupil, but a poetic, romantic, deeply emotional, caring, brave, adventurous and philanthropic woman. And she got to hobnob with the likes of Mark Twain and Alexander Graham Bell! While her life was beset with unimaginable difficulties, and the everyday annoyances, losses and disappointments common to us all, she was eminently triumphant in her journey and leaves the world a legacy of hope, progress and above all, happiness - to not only special-needs children, but humanity in general.

It's just enough to get a glimpse into her well publicized transformation into a girl lost in her own inability to communicate to a wonderfully prolific soul; a person who changed the world. She is disarming and self aware and isn't afraid to gloss over a little bit of the struggle to paint a journey of searching that led to many rivers of experience. It's a charming book and if one is curious about Helen Keller it is best to 'hear' the words from the author than another source."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"This was a good book of Helen and her life in rural Alabama. Being from Alabama myself I have visited her homeplace and it was nice to see where she grew up. I recommend this book for school students and anyone wanting to know more about Helen Keller and her life."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The Story of My Life, an autobiography of Helen Keller, is a motivating story of perseverance and struggle. On July 27th 1880, Helen Keller began her extraordinary life in Tuscumbia, Alabama. As a perky, young child, Helen was quick to learn. On the day of her first birthday, she began to walk, and she had been imitating speech since the age of six months. But tragedy struck, and Helen became severely ill. The doctor pronounced that she had &quot;acute congestion of the stomach and brain,&quot; and that Helen would not survive (19). Then, one morning, the fever was gone, but it had left its mark upon Helen. From that day on, she could no longer see or hear and lived in a world of silence. As the months after her illness passed, Helen was shut out from the world she had only shortly known. On March 3, 1887, a teacher came and unlocked the door that held Helen away from the world. Helen's tale inspires the reader to persist and never give up because, by overcoming her challenges, Helen became her own hero.Throughout the book, Helen's eagerness to learn is clearly depicted. She writes, &quot;The desire to express myself grew. The few signs I used became less and less adequate, and my failures to make myself understood were invariably followed by outbursts of passion&quot; (18). Without this yearning, Helen would have become quiet and naive, floating through life, unaffected. But, this was not Helen. Desire was the spark that kept Helen's mind alive, longing for a way of expression. &quot;When her fingers were too tired to spell another word, I had for the first time a keen sense of my deprivations. I took the book in my hands and tried to feel the letters with an intensity of longing that I can never forget,&quot; Helen remembers, about a book that her teacher had been reading to her (64). Helen's strong need for knowledge and her difficulty in receiving it is passed to the reader who finds a sudden gratefulness for all that he knows.Helen was faced with the many challenges that her physical disabilities brought to her. One of her earliest obstacles was overcoming her strong dislike for mathematics. &quot;Arithmetic seems to have been the only study I did not like. From the first I was not interested in the science of numbers,&quot; Helen remembers (27). At first glance Helen's hatred of math appears to be simply a dislike common to many young children. On closer examination it is found that this is not the case, and Helen's hatred may stem from her difficulty in comprehending mathematical concepts. &quot;I could not follow with my eyes the geometrical figures drawn on the blackboard, and my only means of getting a clear idea of them was to make them on a cushion with straight and curved wires, which had bent and straight ends,&quot; Helen recollects (55). With much determination, Helen looked beyond her hatred of math and worked harder, to overcome her obstacles and eventually graduate from Radcliffe College. By doing this Helen accomplished something that individuals often struggle with, and she taught others not to hide from their problems, but to analyze them, and try harder only then will they go away.With increasing knowledge in Helen's life, her thoughts were open to greater parts of the world, such as feelings. &quot;Knowledge is love and light and vision,&quot; Helen stated (19). On April 5, 1887, Helen became frustrated and tore through the house. In doing so, she shattered her new doll, a present from her teacher. She had no feelings of regret because she did not know the feeling of love. Later that day her life changed and her mind was opened to love and knowledge. She recalls, &quot;On entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way to the hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them together. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized what I had done, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow,&quot; (21). With Helen's realization of grief she also discovered love because in life one new idea often sparks another.Through hard work and perseverance Helen's strong desire for knowledge helped her to overcome all her problems. Contradictory to ancient heroes, pride was not a part of Helen's personality. She dedicated the entire closing of her own book to the people who paved a way for her and taught her to how to make life wonderful. As Helen ends her story, &quot;Thus it is that my friends have made the story of my life. In a thousand ways they have turned my limitations into beautiful privileges, and enabled me to walk serene and happy in the shadow cast by my deprivation,&quot; (81). In her modesty Helen neglects to mention herself when stating the heroes of her story. This story by Helen Keller is motivating and inspiring, a wonderful tale of success."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Most moving and inspiring book I have ever read.

Her story captures its readers and inspires them to look deep within themselves. Blind and deaf at nineteen months, Helen's story tells of her courage and determination and of her remarkable relationship with Anne Sullivan, her beloved mentor. Helen's happiness is felt by the reader when she finds success in learning to communicate. This novel also includes letters that Helen wrote to friends and family sharing her accomplishments."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"In my own personal opinion, Helen wrote a book that not only offered hope for those with disabilites, but one that also shared her MANY talents.Its amazing to read about her childhood in the beginning of her life because, she was struck with her life long disabilities at only 19 months. In her book, The Story Of My Life, she shares all her emotions in such good detail and it really took me back to realize that this woman had to express her self in that way because she couldnt see or much less hear.I just think that her book is so awesome and I love reading it and knowing that people take so much for granted."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Helen Keller (1880-1968) is a revered figure in American popular culture. Struck deaf and blind by illness at the age of 19 months, she still managed to get an education and become a writer and activist. Her story was further popularized by William Gibson's play &quot;The Miracle Worker,&quot; which was also adapted for both film and television.Keller's autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life,&quot; first appeared in installments in &quot;Ladies' Home Journal&quot; in 1902. This book is truly one of the great American autobiographies: an inspiring story of a courageous individual who overcame tremendous odds.Keller writes about many things: her childhood in Alabama; her relationship with her beloved teacher, Anne Sullivan; her attendance at the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf in New York City; and meeting such eminent figures as Mark Twain. She especially stresses her love of literature, which she describes as &quot;my Utopia.&quot;Along the way are some fascinating details and profoundly moving passages. Her tribute to the Homer, the blind poet of ancient Greece, is particularly powerful. I also loved her interpretation of the biblical Book of Ruth: a story of &quot;love which can rise above conflicting creeds and deep-seated racial prejudices.&quot;I think that many will regard Keller's autobiography as a mere historical or sociological document. But I think the book deserves a place as a great work of literature, and moreover as a work of literature in the great American tradition. Keller's poetic, often sensuous words about the natural world are comparable to the work of Emily Dickinson. And her stirring account of her revelatory awareness of language reminds me of Frederick Douglass' account of his first awareness of the power of literacy. The book as a whole is enhanced by Keller's charming, likeable literary style.&quot;The Story of My Life&quot; is a wonderful book by an amazing individual. Helen Keller still has, I believe, much to say to contemporary audiences."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I was about 8 years old, my grandmother had a &quot;bed and breakfast&quot; type of house in Garmisch, Germany, I was on my way home from school and had picked some flowers for her &quot;B &amp; B&quot; tables, when I saw a lady with awhite cane, I gave her the flowers which I had picked for my grandma, The lady to whom I gave the flowers was Ms. Keller, the lady accompanying her was Ms. Sullivan. The next day, my teacher at school asked me to her office. Thinking that I was in trouble (again) I was worried about what was going on. She asked me where I had met Helen Keller; To which I replied &quot;Helen who??&quot; , She then explained to me who Helen Keller was. My grandmother and I then were invited to one of the finer hotels in Garmisch to have dinner with Ms Keller and Ms Sullivan. At which time she presented me with a hardcover of her book &quot;The story of my life&quot;. What I belive makes this book special is the fact that Ms Keller wrote a note to me In GERMAN, she wrote: &quot;An meiner kleine freund der meine hand froh machte mit 'Primrosen', eine botschft from fruehling mit liebe Helen Keller&quot; In rough translation: &quot;To my little friend, who made my hand happy with a message of spring with love Hellen Keller&quot;. This book is most certainly one of my most price posessions."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The miraculous Helen Keller and her equally astounding teacher, Annie Sullivan, go into great detail of their struggles to overcome Helen's grave disabilities. It is so astounding, in fact, that it's almost incomprehensible. Helen's amazing mental ability, Annie's guidance and their mutual tenacity are surely to be credited.It is a wonderful story to read, especially so because it is told BY them and not as interpreted by a third-party biographer.Unfortunately, Helen's eloquence and the prose of the day can border on the flowery side (to be it mildly) which made me unable to push through as quickly as I might have otherwise.But then again, that's the beauty of her success story: it WASN'T too good to be true!"},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I first read this book in 6th grade. I have read it several times in the intervening years, the most recent time being within the past one year.Helen Keller, blind and deaf since the age of 1 1/2 has offered, in her own words an accounting of her life experience. It is incredible to imagine how this woman, unable to see or hear can give such a strong voice to descriptions of nature. The book is replete with beautiful, articulate metaphors that draw the reader into the world as Helen knew it. One wonders how a person with no language can &quot;think,&quot; and Helen provides some clues. During these &quot;dark days,&quot; prior to the arrival of her &quot;Teacher,&quot; Annie Sullivan, Helen's life was a series of desires and impressions. She could commnicate by a series of crude signs she and her parents had created. She demonstrated early on that she could learn.I like the way Helen herself takes her readers past that water pump when she learned that &quot;all things have a name.&quot; Instead of getting stuck there, Helen takes her readers on the journey of her life to that point.In addition to having a good linguistic base, Helen also demonstrates having a phenomenal memory. When she was twelve, she wrote a story she believed to be her own. Entitled &quot;The Frost King,&quot; it bore a strong resemblance to one written by a Ms. Canby called &quot;The Frost Fairies.&quot; Many of the sentences are identical and a good number of the descriptions are paraphrased. In relating this devasting incident, Helen and Annie recall that Annie had exposed Helen to the story some three years earlier and Helen had somehow retained that information. This plainly shows intelligence.Both the &quot;Frost&quot; stories are reprinted in full, thus giving the reader a chance to see just how amazing being able to remember such a work really was.Helen describes her work raising money for other deaf-blind children to attend the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston and in so doing, embarks upon her lifelong mission as a crusader for multiply challenged individuals."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"This book is Helen Keller's autobiography and is somewhat unusual because Helen Keller was deafblind. It is beautifully written and although I don't necessary agree with all the conclusions drawn by the author of the introduction, I found the autobiography very moving to read. Much of the time Helen wrote in a way that you would not realise she could neither see nor hear anything around her.The fact that Miss Keller was not deaf from birth but became deafblind as a very small child following an illness makes her achievements particularly incredible. She had to re-learn her communication skills and this is due in no small part to her teacher and mentor, Annie Sullivan. Miss Keller came from a wealthy family who were prepared to go to endless lengths to help their daughter to live a fulfilling life, and it is thanks to them and to Miss Sullivan that we have Miss Keller's writings and pioneering work for deaf and deafblind people.This is an incredible book to read and it also provides some interesting cameos of some of the people Miss Keller met (such as Mark Twain) because her letters are included at the end."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Its a miracle!Helen was deaf, but she learned how to read with her fingers.When she was younger she got an illness that when it went away it took her sight and hearing with it around 19 she learned how to read Bridal books thanks to her teacher, and my best friend Anna Sulivan that also taught her the combination of water from a pump on one hand and the spelling of \\"water\\" in the manuel alphabet into her other hand. I think that she message sent to you would be that its not bad being deaf, your just like a person beside that you cant hear or talk nor see.Helen Keller wrote this book to show and to tell you about her life.The quote \\"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much\\" it means that for Helen Keller she would have took a long time to learn how to read but she had people that helped her all together so they did so much to help her.I would recommend this book to girls and boys; women and gentleman between the age of 11 to 35. It is really a good book."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I was in my early teens when I first came across references to Helen Keller, and have long admired her from the little I knew of her story.Reading about her in her own words is an inspiring experience. She strips us of all excuse for mediocrity - she who so easily could have pointed at the cruelty of her fate and resigned to life in the shadows.The courage with which she lived her life, the matter of fact way she accepts herself and moves on, and the significance of her achievements must surely serve as an inspiration and an admonition for all who would otherwise have felt justified in being less than they could be."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Most people have seen the \\"Miracle Worker.\\" That story was more about Anne Sullivan, the teacher of Helen Keller. This book gives you a glimpse into the thoughts of the little girl, Helen. I was amazed to read about things from the point of view of a little girl who was blind and deaf. She was so lost and alone until Anne Sullivan came into her life. But, even she knew when she was doing something wrong. She describes great details of her life I never heard before. She even gives an idea of what life was like before she discovered words. Helen wondered why her mother and others moved their mouth, but it was some time before she knew they were communicating with each other and then her long struggle to communicate began. I was surprised to read how she learned to read lips with her hands and even eventually learned to speak audibly. Not only did she gain that knowledge, but she became a brilliant young woman, writing the English language with great skill, as well as a few other languages. This book is brief, but well worth your time. You will gain a better understanding into the life of one with Helen's severe handicaps."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Originally published in 1903, the first 100 pages tell of Keller's life from childhood to young adult. It is a classic of overcoming obstacles and provided many with their first realisation of what it means to be deaf and blind. It provides a wonderful look into her world and the world of 100 years ago. If there is one thing that sums up Keller's childhood it's \\"with love and many kisses.\\" She never seemed to tired of attention and was everyone's friend.The second half of the book (pages 105-225) is comprised of letters written by Helen from when she first learned to write up until 1901. The first letters are extremely interesting as we see her progression in ability and thought processes. Later on I became bored with the whole process and wished that there was some context to what she was writing about. A handful of the letters are explained by the compiler but most are just an exercise in reading someone else's mail and not terribly exciting at that. The story deserves 5 stars; the letters 2 stars."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The book is educational, historic, somewhat interesting, but as far as great memoirs go, Keller was not a very good writer. Her book is full of purple prose. (If you are unfamiliar with the term, look it up, the term will last you a lifetime.)She may have been a greatly accomplished activist and spokesperson for various causes. She certainly accomplished more in one life time than most people could ever accomplish in thirty lifetimes, if they were granted the chance to live over and over. As far as accomplishments, Keller was outstanding.Nevertheless, Keller was no writer, novelist, or autobiographist of any literary merit. If you are looking to learn about Keller, read it. If you want fine literature, don't bother.Also, there are great gaps of Keller's life left out of this book. It portrays a prissy, lily white, sanitized version of Keller's life. Read other biographies of her life if you are interested in the truth. If not, don't bother. This book offers a small fraction of what Keller's life truly encompassed; the immensity of her later accomplishments are not contained in this book. Consequently, if you have always relied on this one book as a true portrayal of Keller, then you know nearly nothing about her. There is much, much more that she does not write about in \\"My Life\\".I would highly recommend this book for adolescents.In other words, both greatness and great deficiencies can be found in this book, it depends on what you are reading it for."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"A little girl's life has barely any happiness. She has no idea about the beauty of the world. She is eventually \\"saved\\" by her teacher in Helen Keller's heart touching autobiography The Story Of My Life.Helen Keller lived in a small house (later a larger one) in Tuscumbia, Alabama. She was born on June 27, 1880. As a young toddler full of life, she was fast on her way to talking.Suddenly, at 19 months of age, a terrible disease struck her. The doctors knew she was very ill and thought she would not live. Although she did live, the disease left her deaf and blind and trapped in a world she wasn't familiar with.This terrible tragedy left her family really shaken. Because she was disabled, her parents often gave in to her every wish. By the time Helen was 7 years old she was an angry, wild and often disruptive child. Her mother knew she was a bright little girl but didn't know how to reach her. She knew she must get her help. Helen was locked up inside herself and her desire to communicate was growing. The family was advised to consult Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, of Washington, who recommended they write to the director of the Perkins Institution in Boston. The needed a teacher who was qualified enough to begin her education. March 3, 1887 became one of the most important days of Helen's life. Anne Sullivan, her new teacher, would help Helen out of her isolation and open her to the gifts of knowledge.In the beginning, Helen easily got confused about what Anne was trying to teach her. Then there was the great day when she placed Helens hand under some water while at the same time spelling w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. This was a true joy to Helen because she made the connection; she knew what water was! Learning this word opened her, gave her such hope and joy! She knew she would learn. She felt proud and confident. Her temper tantrums were reduced and she became eager to learn more and more. The whole first summer Anne was with her she did nothing but explore with her hands and learned the name of every object she touched.Once Helen had the key to language she was eager to do more. She learned to read, do some arithmetic (not her favorite) and even studied zoology. In May 1888 Helen took a trip to the Perkins Institution in Boston. During the train ride, Miss Sullivan described all of the scenery along the way to Helen. Helen loved this! She would imagine it all with every word Miss Sullivan drew on her palm. At the Perkins school, Helen made many friends. What a joy it was for her to talk with children her own age. She never imagined that there were other children in the world with the same problems she had. With school, friends and communication her life was so much fuller than she ever dreamed it would or could be. She spent all of her winters in Boston after this first trip.In 1890 Helen learned to speak. The impulse to utter sounds was always strong for her.She was taught by the principle of the Horace Mann School, Miss Sarah Fuller. She took Helens hands and ran them lightly over her face when she made different sounds. After 11 lessons she was able to speak. Her first sentence, a true thrill, was \\"It is warm.\\" SheCouldn't wait to speak with her own family. One of the happiest moments of her life was the first time she spoke to her Mother, Father, and Sister.In October 1896 Helen entered the Cambridge School for Young Ladies to be prepared for Radcliffe. Miss Sullivan attended classes with Helen and would help interpret instructions given. She studied English History, Literature, German, Latin, and Math. Helen was working wonders but also working to hard. In 1898 Mr. Keith began to tutor her and for eight months gave her lessons five times per week. She was on her way to her dream of college. In the fall of 1900 this dream of going to college came true. She was officially a student at Radcliffe. She began her studies with such eagerness. She saw a new world opening and felt the capacity to know all things. After awhile she felt some disadvantages about going to college. Helen liked to take her time and sit, think, reflect. She felt people were going to college to learn without a lot of time to think. She loved her time with her books. Reading at her pace and really thinking about what she was reading. Along with her love of reading she had a love of many other pleasures. She learned to row a boat, to swim, the go canoeing and to sail. She loved being on the water. Because her world was unlocked for her she seemed to cherish everything she did.Helen Keller's life should be an inspiration to anyone with or without any type of handicap. Her story is truly inspirational for the sighted and the blind, the deaf and the hearing, the young and the old. It shows us you can over come anything when you put your heart and mind to it. With each step you take towards a goal, you can become more excited and encouraged to continue on a path that will take you to what you are working and wishing for."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I have read 3 books on her and this was the most detailed but had the least amount of the stories that are attributed to her.

Her style is contemporary with the age it was written in; the turn of the century 1900s. The author implements many devices in her work; such as Imagery, Current Events, and Personification.The wonderous imagery that she uses can be seen in the winter scene. It is depicted through the descrptions of her teacher Anne Sullivan. Anne tried to describe everything in perfect detail to Helen which in turn must picture everything mentally and only dream about what we all take for granted. This effect adds to the piece by forcing the reader to wonder how she can make such vivid descriptions on her own. Yet, the truth is that she probably wrote the exact words that her teacher so vividly described to her though the manual language.The use of Current Events in this autobiography pertains to many known and famous events and people which were well known at the time and still today. Alexander Ghram Bell (the inventor of the telephone played a major factor in her life by reccomending her to the Perkins Institute for the blind/deaf. The 1893 World's Fair played an important role in the emphasis of the era in which she grew up in. The New York Worlds Fair gave Helen a chance to travel around the world without actually going anywhere but the park.Helen Keller had many dolls which she often played with. Like most girls she had a name for her favorite doll; it's name was Nancy. She fed it mudpies, and put button eyes on it. This added to the caring effect and the fact that Helen was just a small girl like all other girls evn thought she was so different.The autobiography of the first 20 years of Helen Keller's life is pretty imprssive but I dont think it gives us a full picture of the famous Keller that we know now. Much of her campaigning and spokeswoman work was done after she graduated from Radcliffe College in 1904. I recommend this book for educational reading. Perhaps some people will enjoy this book more than I, but the inconsistencies in her writing take away from the truthful meaning of the book. I give it four stars because of the impression it put on me. After all, it isn't everyday that a blind person graduates from college."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Helen Keller- The Story of My LifeBy: Helen KellerReveiwed by: J. YangPeriod: P.4In the first nineteen months of Helen Keller's life, she is a normal child like us. Suddenly, a high fever gets on Helen Keller and makes her deaf and blind. Forever, she is in a dark, silent world. Anne Sullivan is Helen's teacher. She teaches Helen how to communicate with signs and gestures. Helen Keller also learns to read and write.What I liked about this book is that it is very deltailed. The story gives details on Helen's feelings, the enviroment, and whatever Helen Keller feels. &quot;On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb, expectant.&quot; You can actually feel how Helen Keller feels. When I read this book, I always feel how Helen feels. I guess the book is very descriptive!Another thing I liked in this book was when Helen Keller was learning. Anne Sullivan is a great, loving teacher. Anne loved Helen. &quot;Miss Sullivan put her arm gently round me and spelled into my hand, &quot;I love Helen.&quot;&quot; Helen asks about what was love, and Anne Sullivan said to her that love is in your heart. Anne is a very passionate person.My favorite part of the book was when Helen went to the sea. She went with Anne Sullivan. Helen went into the sea for her first swim. All the waves were splashing on her. Helen Keller drank some of the water up and then she said, &quot;Who put salt in the water?&quot; Finally, Anne Sullivan carried Helen out of the water for a little rest."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I could not get through this book. I do not like the way it was written. Definitely not an easy read if that is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Well, I bought this book some tiime ago, and decided to read it when there was nothing else to do. I figured with only 75 pages, I could finish it in a day. To be honest I really liked it. Helen Keller gives me an appreciation of the things I take for granted through the narration of her early life. In spite of her disabilities, Helen was able to find beauty in the world and later in her life she fought to solve many of the problems in the world. Few people realize that Helen lived 88 years and spend many of those years as a social activist. The bulk of this book focuses on her early years and how she learned to communicat with the outside world. The book continues into her formal education and the problems she encountered with it. My only problem with this book is the author tends to ramble in the last two chapters about her friends and favorite authors. While this information was interesting, I would have rather learned more about her. This book is well worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"We read a book ABOUT Helen Keller--but there is nothing quite like reading an autobiography. My daughter was SO excited to read this after reading the other. She is only eight but LOVING this book. Her favorite story being when Helen locked her teacher in her room. THis is SO worth the price, and my daughter and I are enjoying our reading time. HIGHLY recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The book talks about the author life and her education. Helen Keller became deaf and blind when she was nineteenth month because of the fever that she had. I like this book because there is a theory that says nothing impossible to learn. The author approved that blind and deaf people can do the same as others maybe more. I like how she struggled with learning and how other people around her influence her positively. She is really a successful woman who makes other people proud of what she has done and also not to give up easily."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Truthfully and briefly: I found much of this book difficult to read. However, I felt I learned some invaluable lessons from reading it. One in particular was the making explicit of something I felt for a long time to be true, namely, the effectiveness of Miss Sullivan's method of teaching. To put it succinctly, by responding to the child's curiosity and letting it lead you wherever it goes(As opposed to formalized instruction). I feel that though this book has been revered for about 100 years, what Miss Sullivan said repeatedly in this regard is still ignored by our educational system. Such is life! Then, Miss Keller's attitude towards failure stands as a ready inspiration for all whose lives are impeded by the fear of failure. She says, &quot;Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow.&quot; Her life and her book are testimony to that dictum."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The first time i read it in 3rd grade in my class i got really into that book.I loved that book because HELEN KELLER the writer wrote it and she had bad health when she was a little girl she couldn't see,and talk.It was hard for her to do all does things too comunicate with people and her family but there was this teacher that loved her and teach her a lot of things and Helen Keller appreciated her the teacher in showing her everything and having patience with her.This book is really good i love this book is my 2nd favorite book.I recomended to everybody.People you should read it.If you haven't read it buy it now it's really good true story of Helen Keller life."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"If anyone has a right to complain about tragedy in life, it is Helen Keller. If anyone has a right to give exuses why she can not achieve her dreams, wallowing in self pity and depression, surely it is this woman. But Helen Keller does very little of that. Amazingly, this woman holds incredible fortitude and optimism. She goves accounts of her hardships, but she always ends with looking at the positive side of things.I also feel saddened by the reviewers who belittle this remarkable woman. They complain about a blind author, who explains things from a visual perspective. But I believe it is Ms. Keller who can see, and it is they who cannot. She has eyes, for other people are her eyes. I also do not agree with the reviewers who criticize the author for relating about the character of her freinds. Her freinds help make &quot;the story&quot; of Helen Keller's life possible. I think the moving element of this whole work rests in this principle. Miss Sullivan, her teacher, must be one of the most courageous, patient and charitable women ever to grace the earth with her existence. When a person looks around, it is easy to only find self-centered people, who waste their lives away, but for Annie Sullivan, her life certainly is not a waste. Helen Keller likewise holds the attitude to achieve the most, and she emplifies that throughout her life. This book makes me feel guilty for anytime I fall into the trap of self pity. It surely is not the circumstances in which we meet life, but the spirit in which we meet them that determines our happiness."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"This book gives a lot of courage and hope to the reader. It emphasizes the same life lesson that we have heard over and over again, &quot;go for your dreams, and never let anything get in the way,&quot; yet it some how sticks out this time because it comes from such a remarkable person. It did, however go into way too much detail about her reading hobby and friends. Overall the book gave be more hope and inspiration than anyone else ever has to never give up on any of my dreams in life no matter what barriers and obstacles get in the way."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I thought that this book was a very good book because it said a lot how Helen Keller overcame deafness and blindness and was able to talk in many different languages!!

What really makes it interesting is that she had a life different from most everyones, being deaf, AND blind. She had many, many challenges in her life, that people who can see, and hear would not be able to relate to. This book really makes you appreciate all the gifts that you sometimes take for granted. This is a book for all ages, that I think anyone can enjoy. Helen Keller is a very unike, and interesting person, and it is neat to remember her life as she shares it with us."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I'm astonished by the one star comments! These people should at least read a story about the way human language emerged and evolved to writing and reading. Maybe \\"How Writing Came About\\" by Denise Schmandt-Besserat and perhaps they would start understanding the unimaginable effort done by Helen and the uniqueness of her testimony, as so well expounded by Konrad Lorentz.Some time ago I had the great opportunity to exchange some emails about this subject with prof. Harold Bloom. Prof. Bloom, who knows very well the story of Helen, suggest that we have not only an internal ear but even an internal eye that allowed Helen to deeply understand the classics she read: her comments are short but so deep. One last remark, a recent book \\" Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain\\" by Maryanne Wolf could be very useful to better understand the key role of Helen Keller (and Anne Sullivan!)."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Helen KellerHelen Keller starts off with her childhood and how she interacted with the people around her. She expresses great emotions towards people and her passions. She has great description about her childhood and has you evolved in her life somewhat. She shows great \\"show don't tell \\"throughout her story. The only thing that is upsetting is this story is titled the story of my life and this is only the first part of her life. The ending letters expresses more about her on a more personal basis.When dealing with Helen Keller's acute illness that left her deaf and blind, commutating with others was a frustration. Her frustration soon turned to brilliance and Helen found different ways to commutate with her parents. Using hand signals, she taught herself to learn. As a deaf and blind student, she studied subject such as Greek, algebra, Latin and many other subjects. The end of her story talks of her graduation from Radcliff College.This book of Helen Keller shows how life can be hard but it was even harder for her because of her disability this book opens your eyes to make you enjoy your life you take for granite and that's why this book is a wonderful master peace of writing."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Helen Keller was indeed blind and deaf. I liked this book because it tells you about so much things Helen overcame being blind, deaf and earlier on \\"dumb\\" ( bcause she was unable to speak). It makes you realize that you can do anything if you really want to no matter what your circumtance is. Also it teahces people to be content and accept the way or conditions that you are in. It's true when they say \\" it could have been worse\\". I read this book to do an essay and i think it was a good choice although it was a little challenging to really comprehend what Helen was always talking about.

She had many struggles but became a speaker and a writter. I received the book right away without any problem, and it great condition."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The Story of My Life by Helen Keller is an autobiography illustrating her insistent desire in learning how to write and read and defeating her deafness and blindness at the same time. This book records her life back from when she was as young as 4 years old. Due to the loss of sight and hearing at age 19 months, Henlen lived her life in frustration and pain. She couldn't understand her family because she didn't yet learn how to communicate. To solve that, her parents hired Ms. Anne Sullivan, who influenced her the most. Even through the special education with Ms. Sullivan, Helen couldn't speak with her family without Ms. Sullivan's translations. Yet Helen didn't give up. Her passion for learning how to read and write overcame the obstacles. Her improvements on reading, writing, and arithmetic amazed her teachers and family. She has succeeded in many areas of her life which might not be as successful if she wasn't as persistent. Her willpower helped her fight against the natural disabibities in her life. As she conquer each hardship, she met helpful people that encouraged her to write and learn. For example, she met the students of the blind institution, and since they lived states away, they'd have to write in order to keep in touch. Each moving story in the book displayed Helen's persistence in learning. The letters attached in the back of the book also illustrates Helen's life. They showed how much Helen had improved since she first started to write. As a result to her hardwork, Helen was accepted in a college as she dreamed. The valuable lesson the book has taught reflects nowaday teenager's behavior. Teenagers should look up to Helen Keller for the what she's accomplished. In fact, people of all ages should read this book to encourage oneself to be brave and do your best."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"They forced me to read this book, but it was worth it, I mean it."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The next time I feel life is treating me unfairly, I'll remember Helen Keller. I am shamed by my own lack of will when faced with the fact of this woman's extraordinary accomplishments.It is simply incredible to think of how brilliant this woman must have been to have overcome the restrictions of deafness, blindness, and being mute. To achieve the level of education with all the restrictions of her era is the mark of not only intellect but amazing focus and determination.What was truly remarkable in this autobiography of a blind and deaf woman was her love affair with books. She called them her \\"book friends.\\" Her perspective on reading should really make people sit up and look at the fact that over-analysis of great fiction can, indeed, seem less about the book than about the egos performing the analysis!It was also funny to read about her exasperation with formal education's emphasis of testing and the scheduling of learning toward those exams. I think this viewpoint would be shared by every student regardless of physical limitations.A very very short book but one which teaches lessons that will stay with me, I'm certain, for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"This is an excellent work for children in the teen years andbeyond. It is written well and the grammatical style isappropriate for the subject matter of the story. The authorrelates her life experiences going back to an early age.Apparently, she lost her sight and hearing as a result of achronic childhood disease prevalent in the late 1800s.There is an extensive recitation of her learning experienceswith hand-signalling and braille. Helen, as many disabledpeople, learned to compensate for her lack of sight bypreparing every lesson extensively. Her series of personalletters are heart-warming. As with Anne Frank, the authorexplained the importance of keeping a detailed diary.Ultimately, perseverance saved her from a life of darknessand complete solitude.

The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book.

Written by one of the most well known personalities of the 19th & 20th centuries, this little jewel of writing which I found and bought for $2. at a flea market, stands alone in emotional and informational appeal, at 138 pages. Born with all five senses, Keller became ill and lost both sight and hearing at the very young age of nineteen months. The facts of her life, even with her unusual style of writing, are as impressive, moving, and awe inspiring as they are sad and heart rending.. I wanted to come to her defense when she was falsely accused of intentional plagiarism after writing a story she thought was original, but which she had \\"heard\\" previously. Then I wanted to take her in my arms and hug her, cry with her, laugh with her, and encourage her at other points in her life. I found myself wanting to learn sign language, finger language and any other method of communication, find a group of blind and/or deaf children and spend the rest of my life with them. Instead, I find I can only grieve that her life and mine did not cross paths. Instead, I find that the first thing I can do is strongly recommend \\"The Story Of My Life\\" to my wife as a teaching tool in her Christian junior high and high school classes. I see many teaching opportunities: the value of every life, no matter how it may appear handicapped; the importance of never giving up; the strength one can find within themselves when facing daunting odds; the deep truth that life is what you make of it; the lesson for young students that school is not easy, but it is worth the effort; and even creative writing examples as she describes \\"streams laughing and gurgling down a hillside, bumping into rocks\\"; and on and on. From a strict autobiographical point of view, \\"The Story of My Life\\" seems to be lacking much information. However, I will confess that I am so impressed with this amazing lady's courage, wisdom, insightful \\"vision\\" (which, incidentally, I think FAR surpasses my own \\"vision\\"), and just plain old \\"intestinal fortitude\\", that I am probably prepared to be amazed at and gush effusively over anything she wrote.\\"The Story of My Life\\" by Helen Keller, written by herself on her braille tablet and with a braille typewriter, is highly recommended reading by anyone who wants to feel sorry for themselves for the misfortunes of life; for anyone who wants a glimpse into the life of someone blind and/or deaf; and for any teacher who wants a short and compelling story to assign her students and be able to use it for multiple purposes.

This edition was not listed on Amazon to place this review."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I think that Helens Book was a great message. I think it tells people that no matter who you are you can always reach your goal."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"First of all, I would like to take a short notice of the introduction by Jim Knipfel. Never in my life have I read an introductionary presentation of a person as famous as Helen Keller that was so condescending, sneering, and downright rude. I suggest the publishers of Signet Classic to discard Jim Knipfel's piece and replace it with an introduction that is of high quality and professional tone that meets Helen Keller's standards. Now, for the book The Story of My Life, the autobiography is as brilliant as it is an uplifting experience of having overcome the odds. I know what is it like to be deaf myself, but I can't imagine being blind too. It's so tough to think how I could succeed in this kind of life, but Helen Keller really did it and with high expectations. It is quite amazing that she went to an accredited college and earned a degree while possessing a knowledge of six languages (fingerspelling counts as one as it is part of American Sign Language). When she talks about her achievements, there is a great deal of pride in herself because she knows how hard it was to do it. At times, she commits the crime of supplying purple prose which went off the topic too much. One thing I notice about her writing is that it remains very positive throughout the book. She seems to be eternally grateful of being alive and granted with the fruits of life, and her accomplishments certainly reflect the fact. I am a little bit unsure as I am reading each chapter if she wrote it at that period of time, or did she write the story at the end of her college studies? I say this because I notice how her tone and attitude have dramatically changed. After finishing The Story of My Life, there is a collection of Helen Keller's letters. I admit, I found all of them boring and couldn't read much of them except notice the improvements in relatively a short time, especially for somebody that is so precociousness as Helen Keller. I read some of the negative comments written by the reviewers, and I do agree with some of them in a certain extent, but one of them is so odd that I am compelled to address the issue. One said, in her title, \\"Great story...hard to teach.\\" Quite frankly, I find that comment narrow-minded. Surely, have you thought about teaching the ABC's of American Sign Language to the hearing kids? Have they met a deaf person before? Have they met a blind person? Or how about a deaf-blind person before? Have they learned about their culture? Have you taught them the characteristics of their lives and how they overcome adversities like watching television, talking on the phone, attending classes, etc.? Have you taken the kids to a school for the deaf and blind? I assure you, the experience for the kids can be very enlightening and surprising. One of the lifelong frustrations of my life being a deaf person as I am is the lack of acceptance by the hearing people. They seem to have this certain assumption that I can't do a lot of things just because I can't hear. It sounds hard to believe for most of you, but the fact is, this problem is incredibly prevalent. That's why The Story of My Life is a great and useful experience of exposing the young readers the kind of a world that deaf and/or blind people that live in and how they manage to live their lives. All in all, The Story of My Life presents a miracle of a woman who overcame all odds to be the best person possible as she can be, and it's shocking for me to see her to do it so considering the time period she lived in given the history of education among students with disabilities."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I absolutely fell in love with this autobiography because of Keller's powerful story of triumph. Through a type of streamed thought, her writing is beautifully honest and touching. Although this work is non-fiction, it is interesting to see the literary devices that have been weaved into the story. Even from the very beginning, Keller uses great similes. On the first page, for example, she states, \\"I have, as it were, a superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist.\\" In addition, she alludes or refers to the bible on occasion. A perfect example is her allusion to Mt. Sinai. Her biblical allusions very much lend themselves to a later part of the work when Helen speaks and learns of God. Furthermore, great imagery is used in her descriptions. Helen Keller loves nature, especially flowers, and she can describe them better than any person with perfect vision! She expresses the joy she finds pressing rose petals, as well as the wonder she finds in the motion of lilies swaying. Her beautiful imagery and her quite descriptive similes thoroughly amazed me; there were parts where I often forgot Helen was blind. The overall message of this work is the concept of man's ability overcome obstacles. While developing immensely and never giving up hope, Helen Keller is the epitome of the soul's ability to persevere."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"The Story Of My Life was a life-changing book for me. The reason for this is because I never thought that a person who had no power could do so much and have so much of it. As soon as I read this book it made me feel that no matter how small you are you can accomplish your dreams and goals. My opinion about this book is that it taught me that even if you are disabled, like Helen Keller you can still do many things. I think what Helen Keller did was outstanding because even though she was blind, deaf, and only a kid she did some indescribable things. I think this book will be a page-turner for people in middle school and up. This has inspired me to do anything and believe that I can accomplish many goals that I have."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"This book contains the autobiography of Helen Keller, written while she was a college student, as well as the letters of Annie Sullivan, her extraordinary teacher, and the notes of John Macy, an assistant. There are also letters written by Helen Keller throughout various stages in her life.My 12-year-old was assigned the autobiographical portion only, but found it so interesting that she continued to read all of Annie Sullivan's letters to the Perkins Institute. For my daughter to dig deeper, on her own, was a remarkable thing! I was really pleased to find her so engrossed with the story of Helen Keller.It's fascinating to read about her life from the three different points of view (Keller's, Sullivan's, and Macy's.) As a teacher, I view her progress one way. As a mother, I see it another way. As a fellow human, I experience it in a totally different way. I found myself sitting for long periods, imagining what it must be like to have been Helen as a child, as a student, as a traveler...I heartily recommend this book to anyone over the age of about 12. Younger children would benefit hearing it read aloud and discussed. It's a classic that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Written when Helen Keller was 22, \\"The Story of My Life\\" is about her life as a child and young lady. She was not born blind and deaf, but as a toddler suffered an illness that almost killed her and robbed her of her sight and hearing. Helen was seemingly unteachable and growing wilder each day until Helen's parents hired Anne Sullivan who was to become her beloved \\"Teacher\\". Helen became a proficient student, learning not only to read and write and speak, but also learning several languages eventually graduating from Radcliffe College.This is an extraordinary book about an extraordinary woman. The book is divided into two parts: Keller's autobiography and her letters. Her autobiography is written a bit flowery, but is interesting as she describes her early years and how she tried to communicate with people and her increasing frustration when they couldn't understand her. She writes about how Anne Sullivan finally got her to understand the word for \\"water\\" and how she quickly learned other words after that breakthrough. She tackles what was a very painful time in her young life when she was accused of plagiarizing a story when she was only 11 years old. She ends her autobiography by describing the things she loves in life: reading (books that she loves and her favorite authors), history, languages, the outdoors, sailing and visiting friends.As interesting as Keller's autobiography is, her letters reveal even more about her life. Printed in chronological order, starting when Helen was just 7 years old, the letters show how quickly her grammar and writing skills developed. In the autobiographical section of the book, it is easy to forget that Keller was deaf and blind as she writes about talking to people and things that she's seen. Her letters explain better how people communicated with her and even the toll it took on Anne Sullivan, who had continuous problems with her eyes. Her letters explain how she wrote letters using a special board and a regular pencil and how she was able to read people's lips and feel things in a museum to get an appreciation of art. Very interesting reading.My only complaint about this wonderful book is the editing. The book was first published in 1903 and has been in print ever since, but I wonder when it was last edited. There are notations that a footnote will follow but there is no footnote. There are mentions of people who were well known in Helen's time, but today's readers might not know how they were and footnotes should have been used to explain who they were, starting with Laura Bridgman who apparently was the inspiration for much of the education the young Helen got. Also, Helen raised money for the education of a blind and deaf boy, but there was no mention of what happened to him later in life.Editing aside, this is a wonderful, inspirational book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Although Helen Keller's style is at times overly idealistic and flowery, her insights into her own peculiar way of seeing the world are absolutely invaluable. She has truly penetrating things to say not only about famous figures of the time who she was able to meet (including Alexander Graham Bell), but also about spirituality, literature, and countless other realms of experience."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":".A book to read that is of the warmness of soul, an account that conveys love and realness. The body and the mind are only the peripheries, for it is the soul or consciousness that is of the real person. So when the mind is expanded in knowledge and intellect, one can find erroneously enter in it's subjectivity defining such as the real self or one can use such intellectualism as an instrument of the consciousness and view objectively. This then allows the heart and feelings to penetrate, in turn the mind is transcended, one goes beyond the mind to the real inner self. And when this occurs the result culminates in the most beautiful and extraordinary person. Such is the case of Helen Keller.Her fingers found expression, felt emotion and penetrated the surface into the feelings and depth in the person she encountered, in the words that she read and in the vibrations that she felt. I have read in the East, that consciousness does not come to us solely through the eyes and ears, but when such peripheries are down we can perceive in much more strength through other senses.\\"I derive genuine pleasure from touching great works of art. As my finger tips trace line and curve, they discover the thought and emotion which the artist has portrayed. I can feel in the faces of gods and heroes hate, courage and love, just as I can detect them in living faces I am permitted to touch.\\" P. 68In a letter she received from Mr. Gilder, Helen wrote,\\"In a letter he wrote me he made his mark under his signature deep in the paper so that I could feel it.\\" . . . and \\" I feel the twinkle of his eye in the handshake.\\" P. 75Case in point is that of poetry. What the average school teacher and intellectual defines in art and poetry are the stanzas, the numerical structures and literary criticism. Now this actually destroys such forms of art. But what intellectual, a person that uses their head without the heart can fathom any understanding beyond such? Helen wrote:\\"Great poetry, whether in English or Greek, needs no other interpreter than a responsive heart. Would that the host of those who make the great works of the poets odious by their analysis, impositions and laborious comments might learn this simple truth! It is not necessary that one should be able to define every word and give it its principal parts and its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and appreciate a fine poem.\\" p. 59Not only did she find the external world but went to the university and went further in learning and knowledge than most. But it is her understanding and diligence, her positivism and depth that this autobiography conveys.After reading her account, I can say that if I could love another person, I have fallen in love with Helen.\\"Is it not true, then, that my life with all its limitations touches at many points the lif of the World Beautiful? Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and I learn, whatever state I may be in, therein to be content."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"How often can we really delve into the life of the blind? When we ourselves are not blind. How about understanding what it's like to be deaf? Or what about living most of life unable to speak?Helen Keller experienced them all and lived with all of these conditions in a most miraculous way. This is a woman who overcame many obstacles.I remember watching a video of the Miracle Worker in 7th grade and have always been inspired by the story of Anne Sullivan breaking through the wall that surrounded her young student, Helen Keller.This particular book gives you the story from the other side. I can only imagine what it was like to be young Helen Keller trapped in a dark, soundless world unable to speak. Her short autobiography is stunningly optimistic. This is a woman who met challenges and took them head on.Her story is one of triumph in the face of set backs. She never let her condition be a stumbling block but always a stepping stone.This story is a marvelous picture of the many accomplishments of Helen Keller. It is called &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;.

On an interesting note, I recently read a book titled &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; which uses quotes from this book at the beginning of each chapter.Do yourself a favor and buy this one.

But in terms of language style and story-telling, it's 4-star for me (understandably, it's 100 years ago).Helen Keller wrote this in her 20s, while pursuing her degree at Radcliffe. So this is not her whole life, but wow.. what an amazing story!A girl is blind and deaf, and I would probably give up on her. But I'm ashamed of myself for that. Helen Keller was deaf and blind and yet this didn't stop her. She's bright and strong-headed. The power of self-determination combined with the great help from the wonderfully patient teacher in Anne Sullivan opened the door for her. Her desire to communicate with people, and her passion to \\"be normal\\" made her who she had accomplished to be.How did she \\"listen\\"? How did she \\"speak\\"? How did she write? She did all that and was good at them. Astonishingly unimaginable. And with such a kind heart, she could easily make a more complete person that we \\"normal\\" people can.\\"Helen sees more with her hands that we do with our eyes.\\"Simply admirable."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"When Helen Keller was a baby, she was perfectly normal.

At first, the doctors thought she was going to die, but no one - not even he doctor knew about her losing her hearing and sight. From this day she doesn't recall what happened during the first months after her illness. She was born in Tuscumbia, a little town in northern Alabama, on June 27, 1880."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I bought my copy at the bookshop in Ivy Green (Helen Keller's home in Tuscumbia, AL) out of curiosity. But when I read it I was filled with joy and admiration at her thoughts and outlook on life.

Her life was one of goodness, grace and dignity in spite of being deaf and blind.

Your sentence is to never see Miss Sullivan again.\\" The Story of My Life is an autobiography by Helen Keller. Helen Keller was a blind and deaf girl who came over all these odds by learning how to read lips with her fingers, how to speak, how to read Braille, and understand things like a normal child. Her teacher throughout her life was Miss Sullivan. She taught Helen Keller just about everything she could when it came to communicating. Because of how she overcame her handicaps, many people, including celebrities, wanted to meet her and have her as a friend. I recommend this book if you like learning about amazing people.Helen Keller wrote this book on her own. If you can think about how hard it would be to write a book when you are deaf and blind, then you will be amazed at how she did this. She wrote a book in her early childhood, but apparently it was read to her when she was younger and it was very close to the same thing, so the institution she was going to accused her of plagiarism. She could not see Miss Sullivan again as long as Miss Sullivan worked for the institution. So, Miss Sullivan quit her job and moved in with Helen and her family and taught her until she was older.Helen Keller got to do many things a normal child would not. She got to travel the world with Miss Sullivan because everybody wanted to meet her and celebrities would pay to fly her out to where they lived. She also had to go to the institution for the deaf and blind, which was far away. Many people there were also amazed at how Miss Sullivan had taught Helen to communicate.If you read this book, also note how many things Miss Sullivan taught Helen. Miss Sullivan taught Helen how to communicate with everybody. Even though Helen has been deaf since she was 3 months old, she learned how to pronounce words so she could talk to people. The hardest thing was probably to teach her to read Braille, which would have been hard because she would not understand the letters at first and what they meant.Helen Keller is one amazing person. She overcame two very harsh defects, being blind and deaf. Any person having just one of those defects may never overcome these illnesses but she did. She not only overcame them she was taught how to communicate even though it was along and struggling process. Helen Keller is an amazing person and you should read the book she wrote.-Jaycee Elliott"},{"Title":"New wrinkles","review":"Roger A. Lewin, New Wrinkles (Chicago Spectrum Press, 1996)Better than Lewin's Lamentations, if only because it's half as long. Less swine to root through for the elusive pearls. But my god, what swine.\\"Poetry has the windfor a coat of arms, the windfor a coat of harms, the windfor a coat of charms.\\"(\\"Poetry Has the Wind\\")In some twisted way, I can see this book becoming a cult classic, elevating Lewin to the same status as the triumvirate of Horrible American Poets-Rod McKuen, Susan Polis Schutz, and Helen Steiner Rice.

Describes and illustrates in great detail all that the beginner needs to know to play. Extensive strategy sections with illustrations and scenarios show offensive and defensive techniques. The book covers the Japanese, American, and Chinese versions of the game. My only complaint is that it focuses on the Japanese, and to a lesser extent the American version of the game. Nice tables are provided for both. In order to learn the rules of the less complex Chinese game, one must read through pages of detailed text to reverse engineer the Chinese rules by removing all of the irrelevant bits. No tables are provided for the Chinese rules. It would be better to have started with the original Chinese version of the game and work up to the other two. However, the book is extremely complete, even with a very extensive glossary of terms in Japanese and English. Highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Mah Jong Handbook","review":"The best book there is in English on the game. Organized as follows:Part One: The Official Game.1. The Mah Jong Set2. Preliminaries3.

Although most of the book actually covers the basics of the Japanese version of the game (along with most of the world wide variations), and the basics of scoring, Part Three, &quot;Strategy,&quot; is what moves this book to its true value. In this short, 50 page chapter are the basic, fundamental strategies which allow the raw beginner to become an informed, reasonably good player medium level player. Though this section is short, it is very dense, and bears reading several times. My own play has improved many fold by following Whitney's sound advice.

It is written in the educated language of past generations (we had a immigrant pathologist in our laboratory recently who informed us he could not handle the English vocabulary and syntax that largely expired in the late twentieth century, which may explain the difficulty another reviewer had with this).Gustavus was admirable, to me, most of all for his Christian charity. His chief opponent, the count of Tilly - who had been responsible for the terrible massacres at Magdeburg and other cities in 1631 - was mortally wounded in early 1632. Gustavus sent his personal physician to Tilly in a vain attempt to save his life. (In contrast, when Gustavus lay wounded on the battlefield of Luetzen, Imperial soldiers, coming upon him, finished him with gunshots - as described in this short book and others, e.g., the Osprey series)."},{"Title":"The midnight lion;: Gustav Adolf, the greatest Lutheran layman","review":"I have read books that were written in a much clearer style (to say the least.)

The book is deeply tragic because of the awareness that people like this are very shortly going to be murdered by the millions for no reason except that they ARE, but it is wonderful in the respect that it shows them as human beings. There is not a lot of action, but that is not the point.

The real \\"treasure,\\" however, is found in the numerous previously unpublished postcards and photographs showing British and German ships throughout that period before during and after the internment of the German High Sea Fleet, right up to 1939 when the Royal Oak was lost. These pictures alone provide an amazing insight into what life was like in what was - according to one sailor's poem reproduced in the book, a little loved posting.As with the rest if the book, a great deal of thought went into the title - which is derived from two elements of Scapa's past that are forever enshrined in the Naval History of our nation. The U-Boat that sank the Royal Oak was U-47 and her motif was that of a snorting Bull. Of course, the Barriers designed to prevent any repeat occurrence are legendary in themselves.Many readers will be surprised that Lawson Wood has produced a book that is not aimed primarily at the Scuba Diver and may even criticise this work for lacking in diving detail - but diving detail was never the purpose. This book will be of immense interest to anyone studying the historical aspects of Scapa Flow as well as anyone contemplating a dive in these northern climes. For me, personally, this book has added considerably to the factual information on my own bookshelf and I see myself returning to it's pages time and again in the years to come.In short, this is the sort of book that everyone will wish they had bought - when it's out of print.NM"},{"Title":"City of the Broken Dolls","review":"I received this volume as a gift, given by a friend who knows my interest in forensic and fetish photography. The subtitle is \`A Medical Art Diary 1993-1996,' but it is actually a difficult book to classify. It is composed of 100 plates, most of which are of bandaged women in various stages of mild undress. They are either wandering around Tokyo, in hospital rooms, or at home. There are some additional contextual shots of scenes in the city without the obligatory bandaged woman.I am tempted to leave it at that. There is no doubt that this is fetish photography. The liner notes write of Slocomb's vision of Tokyo as \`a city seething with undercurrents of violent fantasy, fetishism and bondage.' What gives me a problem is that Slocombe's images lack the kind of intensity that I would expect in this kind of photography. If anything, the bandaging de-sexualizes the women, unlike true bondage, which over-emphasizes sexuality.The printing style emphasizes this difference. All but the cover are in black and white, and are a bit soft in tone and focus. Composition is very offhand and snapshot-like. The overall effect is almost ethereal and bloodless. It's as is we are living in a dream, but one that lacks a story line. I find myself intellectually understanding the implications of the photographs, but totally lacking any visceral reaction.If I were to attack the same problems, I know I would do it differently. I would strive for some element (other than the mere presence of bandaged women) to focus the viewer and provide continuity over the range of images. Slocombe's choices are interesting, but I do not find them compelling"},{"Title":"City of the Broken Dolls","review":"This is fetish photography. However, its not in the style of the excellent 'Generation Fetish,' but rather different. It presents bondage images of female Japanese women injured (in some cases from real events such as Motorcycle acidents - others are studio recreations). The idea of bondage comes from the medical bonds that have been placed upon the subjects - Should situations that are intended to heal become a sexual thing? The bandages and casts, that in the black and white photography vividly stand out as symbolic white bonds - allow one to explore where the boundries of fetish excess lie. None of the imagery is gratuitous but does raise the question of guilt and feminists may argue that that it is the optiomy of the 'male gaze.' Eitherway the product confronts the audience and questions the moral boundry of sexual arrousal - Whether you enjoy it or not this is fantastic!"},{"Title":".NET System Management Services","review":"This book is intended for both system administrators and developers.If you work for relatively small &quot;start-up&quot; company, chances are you have been involved in System Administration aspects as well as DBA as well as Software Development as well as &quot;The guy who troubleshoot and replaces broken computer parts&quot;, this book is very useful to you.This book walks you through System.Management namespace of the .NET framework, a wrapper around WMI(Windows Management Instrumentation).

Books that challenge popular misconceptions are always fun as well, so this book, with its promise to debunk \\"1,000 delusions\\" seemed like it would be an engaging read.The problem is, the author clearly had a hard time coming up with 1,000 misconceptions. There are many legitimate debunkings in this book, such as \\"lemons contain the most vitamin C\\" or \\"we use only 10% of our brains,\\" but many of the others:a) are stupid to the point where it's hard to believe such misconceptions are in any way \\"common\\" to actual humans (who honestly believes that \\"plastic surgery involves plastic\\" or that \\"the painting of Washington crossing the Delaware is an accurate portrayal\\"?)b) feature answers that are so convoluted and obscure it's hard to really argue much has been \\"disproven\\" (for example, one \\"myth\\" is that \\"there are no such things as unicorns,\\" which is obviously true. But the author says that what people used to believe were the horns of unicorns were actually the horns of narwhales, which do exist. Uh, fair enough, but that still doesn't make the original premise outright wrong.)c) claim authoritative answers to matters which are still very much debated, like \\"the Civil War was about slavery\\" or \\"Jesus said he was the son of God.\\" Matters like these cannot be boiled down to a simple wrong/right dichotomy.d) have answers that are just full-on urban myths. So-called misconceptions like \\"George Washington was the first President of the USA\\" or \\"Chop Suey is Chinese\\" are both actually true, but the book presents them as myths because the author ascribes to certain counter-myths.It's not hard to write a trivia book. All you need to do is string together a bunch of random factoids that sound vaguely intelligent and provocative. To write a GOOD trivia book is much more difficult, however, and requires sophisticated research and thoughtful writing- two qualities this book lacks.If you are interested in good trivia, I recommend reading \\"the Book of General Ignorance\\" or any of the \\"Imponderables\\" books by David Feldman."},{"Title":"Molly: Child Number 583","review":"Readers of popular Angela's Ashes will love Molly, Child #583 by Mary Keenan, a member of the Canadian Author's Assoc., Toronto chapter.

Poignant memories come to life as we meet frightened little Molly, share her cold childhood in a Maritime orphanage and witness her rude awakening to adulthood.Abandonned to a cruel fate that she did not deserve, Molly learned to nurture herself, develop her resilience and fill her empty heart with warm thoughts.

From the summit of Everest to the polar ice of the Arctic, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; redefines peak performance from a place where success has been tested through adversity.Based on the philosophies of John Amatt, an internationally-renowned motivational speaker and a leader of Canada's first successful climb of Mount Everest, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; is about attitude. &quot;The Adventure Attitude&quot;. &quot;Adventure isn't hanging on a rope off the side of a mountain&quot;, says Amatt. &quot;Adventure is an attitude that we must apply to the day-to-day obstacles of life -facing new challenges, seizing new opportunities, testing our resources against the unknown and, in the process, discovering more of our own unique potential&quot;.Writer Alan Hobson gives voice to Amatt's approach by profiling five individuals who embody the Adventure Attitude: Laurie Skreslet, the first Canadian to reach the summit of Everest, exemplifies &quot;the calibre of courage&quot;. John Hughes, the first to intentionally sail the waters around Cape Horn with a makeshift mast, typifies &quot;the power of persistence&quot;. Mike Beedell demonstrates &quot;the capacity of curiosity&quot; in his voyage by open sail boat through the Northwest Passage in Canada's north. Sharon Wood symbolizes &quot;the triumph of teamwork&quot; as the first woman from the Americas to ascent Everest. And Laurie Dexter, who skied across the North Pole from Russia to Canada, portrays &quot;the excellence in endurance&quot;.Hobson surprises, however, by highlighting the fallible nature of each adventurer. He certainly does not paint picture-perfect success or plastic portraits of Type-A personalities. It is the energy generated by attitude that fuels their sometimes staggering achievements. The five adventurers are in agreement. &quot;The way I perceive my environment&quot;, says Sharon Wood, &quot;is the only thing that makes me different&quot;.The Adventure Attitude is meticulous, intelligent, and aware; it does not compromise itself with an undisciplined drive to possess either social status or wealth. This alone is enough to set &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; apart from most guides to success. The Adventure Attitude is an 'itch' that compels individuals to depart again and again from the comfort and security associated with traditional standards of achievement.Sailor John Hughes articulates the need to steer beyond out-dates definitions of success: &quot;As a whole, people in our society have moved away from testing their mettle to measuring everything by accepted standards: the size of your house, the number of cars you have, your income etc... Unfortunately, we tend to be a little more concerned with how we think other people view us than with how we view ourselves&quot;.&quot;One Step Beyond&quot; is a celebration of the individual, both as the solo navigator of personal challenges and as an essential resource in team effort. The spark that makes an ordinary venture into an 'adventure' is the element of risk. Hobson and Amatt demonstrate that risk, if weighed, scrutinized, and acted on with unflinching resolve, can reward with immeasurable self-confidence. Confidence feeds an ever-expanding circle of accomplishment, and is as vital an investment as good old-fashioned capital.Risk, in the world of &quot;One Step Beyond', holds life and death in the balance. Before Laurie Skreslet stood on the summit of Everest, four climbers were killed in avalanches on the mountain. The book describes how the tragic accidents affected expedition morale, and how men like Skreslet and John Amatt had pause to re-evauate both team strategy and summit-lust. Mike Beedell's own brush with death reiterates the level of commitment that can characterize adventure: having penetrated the heart of the High Arctic, the route out had to be exactingly pioneered as was the route in.The epic sweep of of all five stories makes &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; as dramatic as the ancient tale of Jason and the Argobauts sailing through the clashing rocks. On both a corporate and personal level, readers will be impressed with how the book liberates the sense of achievement from a traditional emphasis on the final product. It is not the golden fleece that matters, but the quest itself. As we hurtle into the new millennium, we may be grateful for &quot;One Step Beyond's&quot; deeper contribution to the psychology of leadership."},{"Title":"One Step Beyond: Rediscovering the Adventure Attitude","review":"This is an exciting and extremely well written book, which profiles five adventurers and investigates what they have learned from overcoming physical adversity and how they now apply it to achieving success in their everyday lives.The book profiles climber Laurie Skreslet, the 1st Canadian to scale Mount Everest; sailor John Hughes, who deliberately sailed solo around Cape Horn with a makeshift mast; photographer Mike Beedell, who was a member of the 1st team to cross the Northwest Passage using only wind power; mountaineer Sharon Wood, the 1st North American woman to climb to the top of the world (the 29,028 foot summit of Mount Everest); and Laurie Dexter, a member of the 1st expedition to ski from Russia to Canada via the North Pole.From these five profiles, author Alan Hobson and renowned adventurer/speaker John Amatt, then develop their innovative &quot;Adventure Attitude&quot; philosophy for striving for success in the turbulent and unpredictable world of the new millennium.A must read for anyone with personal &quot;mountains&quot; to climb."},{"Title":"One Step Beyond: Rediscovering the Adventure Attitude","review":"One Step Beyond provides an amazing outlook on life.

This is the 2nd Amanda Quick book I have read (the first being \\"With this Ring\\") and there is no comparison between the two. I really enjoyed her first book, but with \\"Second Sight\\", it felt like reading a different author entirely. The characters were bland, the dialogue repetitive, and there was no sexual tension whatsoever. This is light reading with a capital L. I'm going to try another of her older books, I hope it isn't as boring as this one."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I like Amanda Quick's books (and also the books she writes as Jayne Castle). I think they're fun, lighthearted, amusing - even if they can be rather samey and a bit, well, cheesy.Second Sight seemed a little different to her other Regency/Victorian books.Although the basic story is the same - romance mixed in with a murder mystery and a bit of psychic/mesmerism included as well, like Wait Until Midnight and some other books, this one felt a little... well... stale.It started off a little differently, with the requisite giving up of virginity to tall, dark, handsome rugged stranger at the beginning of the book rather than halfway through, and somehow the rest of the book didn't quite ever catch my attention fully.Our heroine Venetia is a photographer and she has a special talent in that she is able to view people's auras. Gabriel Jones, the tall dark rugged man, is a secretive chappie who takes her virginity and then gets himself killed. Venetia pretends she's his widow so that she can make her way in her photographic business more successfully than being a spinster - but then Mr Jones turns up alive and they start investigating murders and missing relics. It's all similar stuff to that which Amanda Quick has churned out before, but it doesn't quite have the magic that some of her other books have.It's noticeable that the chapters are shorter in this book and that there aren't any real cliffhangers - things resolve quickly, moments of scary fighting only last a page or two, and the resolution trundles along as expected.Some of the vocabulary in this book is remarkably similar to that in Amaryllis that Jayne Ann Krentz wrote as Jayne Castle. The \`hunting', \`primitive', \`throwback' descriptions of Gabriel Jones seem very like Rafe Stonebraker in that other novel; is she running out of ideas?Overall this book is a perfectly acceptable read, and none of her novels are great literature, but I usually find them better than this and Ghost Hunter, her latest Jayne Castle, was way better. This is still a step up from the Lavinia Lake books she wrote as Amanda Quick, though."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"outstanding book. Very good subject and very well written. I loved Venetia and her modern views."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If you have enjoyed Amanda Quick other books you will find this one very entertaining. The characters are interesting and play off of each other well. The idea of both Gabriel and Venetia having paranormal abilities and both using them on each other was exciting. Both of their families were enjoyable to read about. I hope her next book is about Caleb, Gabriel's cousin."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I found this surprisingly good. I'm not much of a romance reader unless it is mixed with another genre, but I really liked this one. The characters were smart, funny, and endearing. The setting is historical with a touch of fantasy. The characters have some form of magical ability which they hide from society by being a part of the \\"Arcane society.\\" I thought the minor characters were so funny and sweet. Each was different and unique from each other. I'm looking forward to reading more in this series."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This was a pretty good story, and I really liked the interactions between the hero and heroine. I have always enjoyed Ms. Quick's characters, they are not your usual cookie cutter fare. This book is no exception, and it is very well written. I especially liked the elements of paranormal that were tied into the plot-and it was very smoothly done as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a touch of the supernatural in their romance, and also to all the readers like me, who will pick anything up with her name on it!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've always been a fan of Amanda Quick's witty sense for verbal exchanges and amusing plots, but this is by far one of the worst romances I have ever read. The romance between the couple in unconvincing and unsubstanciated; the plot is silly and nonsensical. Do not read it; you'll be disappointed. Try one of her earlier books, like Mystique, that's a bit more plausible."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Upon her parents' death and the resulting financial devastation to her family, it is up to the inimitable Venetia Milton to support her younger siblings and her aunt, else they become destitute. Forging a career as a much sought after photographer in a time when women rarely hold jobs in male dominated professions, Venetia finally manages to obtain a job that will secure her family's fiscal well-being for some time, even allowing an advantageous move to London.Knowing a widow will be better received in Polite Society than an unmarried woman, she invents a late husband, adopting the last name of Gabriel Jones, the man who showed her one night of passion before his untimely demise. The plot succeeds better than she ever expected, and soon she is the toast of the town, an acclaimed photographer in high demand by the most fashionable names in London's elite society.But the unexpected rival of the very much alive Mr. Jones on her doorstep threatens her carefully laid plans, while the danger that follows him threatens her very life!This is the first book from Amanda Quick I have yet read. I was quite excited to read a book by this much lauded author, and the plot for Second Sight struck me as a story well aligned with my reading tastes. With a blend of the paranormal romance amidst a Victorian era setting, it is the kind of tale that I would normally find myself riveted to.The plot was indeed well done, with some very intriguing \`whodunit' twists and a suspenseful story that keeps the reader guessing until the end of the book. Where the book missed, in my opinion, was in the character development. The prologue to the story starred the hero and another male character, and neither intrigued me throughout the prologue. In fact, I could not discern which of the two men was the hero.The first chapter introduced the heroine of the piece, Venetia Milton/Jones, and it is her character that the reader can empathize with first. Through her eyes, we are reintroduced to the hero, Gabriel Jones, and become more interested in this character as well. Both are likable, attractive people, and I genuinely wanted to see them together, but found my excitement for the match dampened by the consistent formality between the pair, even while in the throes of passion.There was almost no real character development for the cast of supporting characters, including Venetia's family, who are present in many scenes. Throughout the first half of the book, these characters remained largely one dimensional, only becoming slightly more interesting in the second half of the book as we saw a bit more of their personalities. Still, having finished the book, I cannot tell you much about something so minor as Venetia's family's physical descriptions, beyond that her sister is 16 years of age and her brother is somewhat younger.With the lack of character development, I felt disconnected to these characters and the story. I could have put the book down at any time and not wondered again what had happened to them.Since reading Amanda Quick's Second Sight, I have discussed my impressions with friends who have also read her work, and they have found the same issues with newer books that I experienced in this one. Based on their opinions of her earlier works, I would like to give one of her older stories a read, as I understand those books did not suffer from the same lack of character development. If the characters are as well-fleshed in the older books as the mystery was in this one, they will be worth giving this author a second chance."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I gave it 4 stars but if available, I would give it 4-1/2 stars. Ms. Krentz never disappoints. I enjoyed this book as I have all of her previous books. I love her sense of humor, and the personality quirks she gives her characters as well as the strength and intelligence she gives all of her female characters. I love that I learn something new about the era she is writing about in every book. I anxiously await the second book in this series."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"It didn't take me long to read this historic romantic suspense novel. Amanda Quick has a way with prose that draws the reader into each chapter alongside the characters.In \\"Second Sight\\", photographer Venetia Milton has a romantic encounter with Gabriel Jones, heir to the Arcane Society, immediately after which she is whisked away to safety while he stays to try and capture intruders before they can steal any valuable artifacts. After reading that Gabriel has supposedly been killed, she moves with her family to Victorian London, using the alias of the widowed Mrs. Jones when she sets up her studio. What follows is a fun bit of suspense, a love story, and a tale of psychical powers all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I'm so disappointed. I always look forward to an Amanda Quick book, although the last several haven't been her best.I can't believe this book was written by Jayne Ann Krentz! The characters were flat and had no life in them. There was nothing to show why the hero and heroine loved each other. The villan was boring and unrealized and the storyline uninteresting. I finished the book hoping for improvements but they never appeared.Sadly, I felt nothing for Gabriel and Venetia. Based on the first chapter I thought I was going to like Venetia but it turned out otherwise. Once she went to London she became hard and a bit unfeeling. I couldn't believe her reaction to Gabriel being alive and not dead - it was as though the woman in the first chapter had vanished and been replaced by this unfeeling person. Her attitude was that he should go away and let her focus on her business. She often unknowingly relayed that disinterested feeling to others. Again, a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Why do I feel that I have read this book before?Could it be because the protaganists are the same characters as in ALL the previous titles by this author? Or maybe because we have the pretend wife/widow plot AGAIN? Or even because there is a secret society of an archaelogical nature -as in the VANZA books?The whole thing is just a mish-mash of previously used ideas thrown together under a new title and with new names.For all that, it is readable. Certainly a great deal better that the Lavinia/Tobias series which I found to be a dead bore!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Photographer Venetia Milton takes the job to photograph the artifacts at Arcane House and spends one memorable night with Gabriel Jones only to be spirited away when intruders threaten their safety.

She is surprised to find that the death of Mr. Jones has been exaggerated when he arrives on her doorstep. He plans to protect her from the villian who has killed in order to steal an artifact. The two pretend to be married in the eyes of society as they begin the search for the killer.Quick has put together another intriguing couple and the supporting characters are intriguing. The paranormal aspects of the books have distinct similarities to the books written under her pseudonym Jayne Castle. The Victorians interest in the occult or paranormal is effectively interwoven into the novel. Overall, this is an exciting reading adventure."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Nice book to escape into.

I have been about 75/25 for the Amanda Quick novels as a whole but this one is right up to her form and takes into consideration both the historical time period as well as the paranormal elements.I read \\"White Lies\\" in hard back so I already knew something about the Arcane Society. The story opens with Gabriel and Caleb Jones, cousins, uncovering some amazing artifacts that an ancestor left behind including his own skeleton, books and a strongbox with a journal that has an alleged formula for increasing psychic powers!! The cousins enlist members of the village to help them load things and, of course, one of the villagers is greedy and steals the journal.We flip a few months ahead to where the lovely Miss Venetia Milton, an up and coming photographer, is taking photographs at the Arcane Society mansion of the many ancient books and antiques that they have including the strongbox. She is escorted by Gabriel Jones. Venetia finds herself very attracted to Mr. Jones who is also intrigued by Miss Milton. Venetia is almost 30 and beyond the \\"marriageable age\\" so she is looking for adventure and passion. She doesn't believe in marriage as her father set a poor example (explained later in the story) and thus is hoping that the \\"heat\\" she sees in Mr. Jones' eyes is some reciprocal attraction.Venetia is successful in seducing Gabriel -- or does he seduce her? However, Venetia also has \\"second sight\\" and senses strangers in the woods headed for the mansion. Mr. Jones summons his servants and sends them and Venetia out through a secret tunnel while he chases after the two strangers. Venetia with her handsome commission from the Arcane photographs goes to London with her aunt, sister, brother and housekeeper to setup a photo gallery.The comedy, complexities, mysteries and romance that then ensue are just fascinating. I read this book straight through and thought it was just great fun. There were enough plot turns to keep the reader guessing as to which person wanted the formula and plenty more twists on how all would be resolved.A fun but intriguing read!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Fabulous as always. I think these novels just get better and better. This one was a little easier to work out \\"who done it\\" than the others but still a fantastic read. I just wish Amanda Quick released more than one novel per year!!!"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I love that I never feel \`had' when I buy a hardcover book by Amanda Quick since her writing is always so consistantly good.When Venetia Milton, a spunky photographer who believes herself to be on the shelf seduces her employer, it isn't just her psychic gifts she's keeping secret. But that's okay because Gabriel Jones has secrets of his own. Venetia is Amanda's standard spunky female lead and Gabriel is her standard alpha male trying to disguise himself as a Beta.One of the aspects that I found so interesting in this book is that she brought some of the characteristics from her Jayne Castle futuristic books into this historical thereby setting up a world view that is continuous across her genres. I would love to see her further pursue this line of thought and more firmly connect characters from her Amanda Quick world to her Jayne Castle world."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Even with the supernatural element, I enjoyed this story. It was quirky and fun, with a hint of mystery and some good characters. It's a traditional romance story, following the prescribed arc, so all of the goodness lies in the little details. Her descriptions, the dialogue, and those little unexpected twists make this a worthwhile read for any romance lover. Not my favorite of her books, but not my least favorite, either.

On the other hand the story'll keep you reading and trying to guess what'll be in the next page."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Late in the reign of Queen Victoria.....Gabriel Jones and his cousin Caleb uncover the remains of their mysterious ancestor and the founder of the Arcane Society in an ancient lab in a remote area of England. Their ancestor, an alchemist, was a believer in the paranormal and cloaked himself in mystery. Many members of the present day Arcane Society believe he took the formula for a mysterious potion among other treasures with him to his grave. When the cousins hire an upcoming photographer Miss Venetia Milton to photograph the relics in the alchemists lab, someone breaks in and steals a notebook written in code that may hold the secrets to the mysterious formula. Venetia must make a living for her family, but when she meets Gabriel she decides to seduce him knowing it may be the only chance she ever gets to taste passion. Shortly after she and Gabriel make love, intruders break in and Gabriel sends her off to London through a secret passage. Months later after not hearing from Gabriel, Venetia reads in the paper that he perished in a fire on the night she left him. To protect her image she assumes the identity of Gabriel's widow. Weeks later to Venetia's surprise a very much alive Gabriel arrives on her doorstep demanding she play out the role of his wife. It seems he faked his death to weed out those who stole the notebook and now Venetia is in danger from their enemies. What starts is a mysterious adventure to uncover the villians and Gabriel and Venetia's must reveal their own paranormal abilities to solve the mystery.I felt that the first two chapters of this book started out with a rush, promising to be a passionate, thrilling book. What happened is the story went downhill from there. The passion faded, the mysterious formula never really is explained (we're supposed to know what it does?) and some of the characters just didn't make sense. For example, the villan takes on a disguise and it is explained he intended to live out his life with this disguise but that just wasn't logical. (If I say more it would ruin it for the reader) His disguise was of a nature that it could have only been pulled off temporarily and his motivations just didn't ring true. Also, what happened to Caleb? HE's in the story at first but then nothing more is mentioned about him...wouldn't it seem logical that he too is in danger....and Gabriel's paranormal abilities just kind of seem downplayed....I expected a lot after the beginning but it just didn't deliver. Its not a bad book but it just started off so good and then left me hanging that I just couldn't give it more than 3 stars. I will read one more in the series to see if it improves but if it doesn't get better that will be the last."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I have read several of the Amanda Quick books and although some are very interesting Second Sight is extremely boring.

This book has interesting characters, an intersesting sub-plot with the Arcane Society going on, but it just felt like a longer book that had been whittled down for publishing purposes. The characters did not have the depth most of her books offer and the plot was a bit lame- just didn't feel like it was more than a detailed outline."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Set in the Regency era. Miss Venetia Milton's parents died over a year ago in a train wreck. Since then Venetia has had the responsibility of providing for her maiden aunt, Beatrice Sawyer, her sixteen-year-old sister, Amelia, and her nine-year-old brother, Edward. Having an excellent talent for photography, Venetia had made due. But when the Arcane Society employed her to photograph its collection of relics and artifacts things began looking up. The Arcane Society paid extremely well and in advance. Venetia left Bath, traveled to meet her new employer, Gabriel Jones, and earn her pay.Venetia and Gabriel knew each other less than a week. During the last time together they were intimate. Before they could speak about any possible future together, they were interrupted by two men attempting to steal a two-hundred-year-old strongbox. Gabriel had his coachman take Venetia to safety before going to hunt his prey.Gabriel Jones was a Hunter. The Arcane Society members consisted of secretive, reclusive eccentrics who were obsessed with the arcane and uncanny. Gabriel's psychical abilities made him a predator, a hunter. Once the two would-be thieves were taken care of, Gabriel decided to let people believe he was dead. However, three months later, when he learned Venetia had opened a gallery in London and has been portraying herself as his widow, he knew that she had unwittingly placed herself in grave danger. Gabriel had no choice but to pretend to be Venetia's returned-from-the-dead husband and move in with her family to keep her safe.**** Let me say first off that you should NOT read the first four books of this series in order of release.

Love her storylines, interaction between characters, quick dialoge, I could go on. However I was a bit nervous about this story, as I really liked her Regency novels, but I am not a big fan of the Victorian Era. But she came though again. Her heroine was plucky and quick-witted and brave and very take charge. Her hero was powerful and confident. Venetia Milton was a photographer (unusual profession for a woman in the Victorian era) with a family to take care of. She was the sole breadwinner in her family consisting of herself, her aunt and her younger sister and brother. She had no time to persue relationships so the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get herself ravished was too good to pass up. Her employer (and ravisher) Gabriel Jones had the eyes of a sorcerer. . . however soon after thier tryst, Venetia learns that he has died tragically. As a romantic whimsy to pay tribute to him, she takes on the guise of Mrs. Jones, a young widow and goes to London to pursue her career.

We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name \\"Jones\\" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest. I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"After a night of passion with Gabriel Jones (the gentleman who had hired her to photograph his collection), photographer Venetia Milton is saddened to read that Gabriel has lost his life in a fire. Deciding to make use of this opportunity, Venetia poses as Gabriel's widow and moves her family to London, where she opens a new portrait shop. Imagine her surprise then when Gabriel walks into to drawing room many months later, very much alive. Apparently, someone wants access to some papers that they think Gabriel has, and he had pretended to play dead in order to discover who had tried to kill him. But now, with Venetia pretending to be his widow, Gabriel is afraid that the killer will come after Venetia. Venetia is stunned, and a little miffed that her plans have come crashing down around her; after all a live husband was the last thing she expected to have to contend with. But with her life, and potentially that of her loved ones at stake, Venetia will have to put her ire behind her and work with Gabriel. But can she? For Venetia has secrets that she'd rather not share, esp with the man she's so terribly attracted to...I know that the last few novels by Amanda Quick haven't exactly been stellar ones --esp when one compares them with her earlier work \\"Seduction,\\" \\"Scandal, etc. But there's always been something, even in her less than stellar works for one to grab onto -- a good storyline, good chemistry between the hero and heroine, suspense. This time around, however, everything seems very flat and very formulaic. The storyline is a variation of one that has been used a number of times, the chemistry between the hero (Gabriel) and the heroine (Venetia) is almost nonexistent, and the villain of the piece not only sticks out a mile (the villain might as well have carried a sign saying \\"here I stand, come and get me.\\") Who would have thought that there would come the day when I would actually give an Amanda Quick novel 2 stars?The shame of it was that the storyline, although it was much used intrigue/mystery subplot, had quite a bit going for it. However, while one can overlook the fact that an author has much used a very familiar subplot, slightly harder to overlook is the fact that the interaction between the hero and heroine in \\"Second Sight\\" lacked sparkle. From the manner in which the first few chapters unfolded, I rather thought that I was going to like Venetia quite a bit -- she seemed intelligent and very capable. But while, thank goodness, Amanda Quick did not allow her heroine to behave in an extremely foolish manner even once, she did make her seem rather obtuse at times. Gabriel, on the other hand, was easy to like and take to, even if his character was under-developed -- and really, one has little choice but to approve of a hero who possesses a sense of humour. All in all, though, this was a disappointing read: the historical aspect was mere wall papering (and although I realize that for many readers this is not a priority. I rather like a little more detail in these historical novels), the suspense was lacking, as was the chemistry between Venetia and Gabriel, and the storyline just lacked energy and vivacity. If you are a fan, by all means read this book, but be forewarned, it is nothing like her earlier works. If you've never picked up an Amanda Quick romance novel, than choose one of her earlier works instead (esp her \\"S\\" series), you won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Seducing Gabriel Jones seems like the perfect solution. He's handsome, charming, and Venetia Milton knows she'll never see him again. And Venetia certainly doesn't want to remain a virgin for the rest of her life. When word arrives that Gabriel has died, she decides to become his widow. In Victorian England, widows have so much more freedom than unmarried young women--and Venetia needs all the freedom she can get to make her photography business thrive. A thriving business is all that keeps her and her family from poverty. When Gabriel walks back into her life, however, not dead at all, her calculations go out the window. Has she put herself and her family in danger, as Gabriel suggests?Venetia and Gabriel investigate the strange occurances that surround an alchemical discovery which Gabriel had made at the beginning of the novel. Someone has already stolen an alchemical notebook and seems intent on stealing the empty case that once held it. But Gabriel's investigation has gotten him nowhere in the months he was presumed dead and Venetia is convinced only she, perhaps using her psychic ability to perceive auras, can help him. Gabriel, in turn, wishes to keep Venetia safe and is frustrated by her willingness to put herself in danger.Author Amanda Quick (Quick is a pen name for Jayne Ann Krentz) is an excellent writer. Her characters come to life and her dialogue sizzles. It's easy to get hooked in SECOND SIGHT and it's a hard book to put down.Still, as I read it, I started feeling as if I had read this book before. I hadn't, exactly. Increasingly, for me, Quick's books are starting to fall into the same pattern--a poor but talented and ambitious female is making her own way in the world--but badguys are causing her trouble. Fortunately, there's a hero around who finds her quirky nature compelling, helps her overcome obstacles (while nevertheless making it clear she could have done so on her own). I think I'm ready for something a little different, please Amanda."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"Amanda Quick aka(Jayne Ann Krentz) never lets us down. And Second Sight is wonderful, full of zest, wit, and wonder. The first in a series about the Arcane Society, I can hardly wait for the next.Gabriel Jones hires Miss Venetia Milton to photograph the Arcane Society's collection of metaphysical and pyschic objects. He is the son and heir to the Master of the Society. Gabriel has his own sixth sense in that he can get emotions from objects that have been touched. Somewhat of a recluse he finds himself enchanted by Venetia and she finds him fasinating and seductive. Because of his abilities Gabriel doesn't go about in society very much. He and his brother do the undercover work for the Society. At this time they are trying to find out who stole the notebook they found in an ancient wizards tomb.Venetia is the sole support of her family, she sees auras, and uses this ability in her photography. Using the money from her job for the Arcane Society she sets up a shop in London. Two weeks after Gabriel has whisked her away from the Abbey because of a break-in she sees his death notice in the paper, shocked and full of grief for the man she briefly felt connected to, she uses his last name as hers when she goes to London, as a widow has more cachet in the sight of the ton. Imagine her surprise to learn he is still alive.Gabriel returns to protect Venetia, and fully intends to exploit the good fortune that she has used his name as hers. Her picture of the lid of the strongbox is very important to the man who stole the notebook and he will do anything to get that picture. As in any good mystery by Ms Quick they are quickly involved in the muddle of events that unfold. I read it in one sitting, lately I have started to debate on my hardback purchases. So many have not been worth the money. This one is. A very good read."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I purchasedSizzle and Burn (Arcane Society, Book 3), unaware that is was part of a series. However, once I discovered that it was the third book in the Arcane Society series - I decided to start at the beginning. So I purchased Second Sight - let me just say that I had reservations about the setting \`Late Victorian England'. I don't normally read things written in this setting - but it wasn't as unpleasant nor as distracting as I normally find the setting.Gabriel Jones was a well written character - I would have like to have experienced more of his dark side. Venetia Milton's character was surprising, she was an unusually strong character for the setting of the book - I have to say I was very impressed.I am now on the 3rd book in the series, and while I am not completely hooked on the series - I have purchased the next 2 - (The Third Circle (Arcane Society Novel)andRunning Hot: An Arcane Society Novel).The series in reading order:Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)White Lies (The Arcane Society, Book 2)Sizzle and Burn (Arcane Society, Book 3)The Third Circle (Arcane Society Novel)Running Hot: An Arcane Society NovelThe Perfect Poison (Arcane Society, Book 6)Fired Up: Book One of the Dreamlight Trilogy (Arcane Society Dreamlight Trilogy)"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"After deciding to seduce her employer, photographer Venetia Milton gets more than she bargained for when criminals interrupt their night of passion. Gabriel Jones, member of the secretive Arcane Society, is sure to put Venetia far from danger before going after the criminals in his home. The thieves are there in search of an alchemist's formula thought to enhance paranormal abilities. Ensuring Venetia that they will meet again, Gabriel goes off to fight the intruders.Later, when the papers report the Gabriel died the very night he sent her away from danger, Venetia decides to take his surname with her new venture in business--the Jones Gallery. She decides to go into trade to support herself and her family which is comprised of her two younger siblings and her aunt. Thinking that she will be given more leeway as a widow, Venetia stuns society with her impressive photography and knack for capturing things unseen in her pictures. When her deceased husband, Mr. Jones, returns from the dead her world is thrown into a whirl. She can't help but wonder if Gabriel returned for her, or for something to do with the paranormal-focused Arcane Society.This book was okay, but just okay. Venetia was likeable, but I never felt that she had a strong sense of identity. Her psychical powers were about all she was good for, and I never really felt any reason to like or dislike her. Gabriel, on the other hand, was an impressive hero and one that I would be interested to read about in future Arcane Society novels. His gift for sensing his prey and protecting what is his were my favorite parts of this otherwise mediocre story.As some of the other reviewers noted, all of Quick's novels are beginning to sound the same. If you like them, then you won't be disappointed. But I can't help but wonder if she has anything else in store for us."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"If this book had been written by any other author, I would have given it 2 stars. I was very disappointed because I have read every book written by Ms. Krentz/Quick and have loved them all. I own them all! This one totally left me cold. I never got into the characters. I thought I would like Venetia at first, but I never really got into her. She was very stiff, formal and had no sense of humor whatsoever. She did warm up some during the love scenes, but even those seemed thrown in because they were necessary in the book. It was like the characters thought, \\"Oh yeah, we're supposed to be incredibly sexually attracted to each other, so let's have some sex scenes\\". The character of Gabriel was also like a shadow of all the other male leads in the Quick books. None of the relationships in the book were well developed. Venetia's and Gabriel's relationship didn't really develop either. It didn't seem like they were friends, let alone lovers. Finally, the mystery seemed to limp along. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me throughout. It then comes to an abrupt, unbelievable end. I hope the next Quick book will be up to the standard of her previous books."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This is my fourth time to write this review. If it doesn't work this time I will know that the paranormal forces are aligned against me and give up. The first two I erased myself. The third one disappeared into that great black hole in the Amazon computer (but only after two days) and it didn't even have any rants, raves, or rambling. Go figure.THIS REVIEW HAS WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER SPOILERS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM, STOP READING NOW!1. This is billed as a paranormal romance. Don't believe it. If you expect to learn anything about the Arcane Society from this book you will be disappointed. Why was the society formed? We are told that the society was formed two hundred years previously by the alchemist Sylvester Jones but that is on page 5 and no more information is given. Who were and are the members? How do you join? How have they maintained the strict secrecy concerning the society all this time? WHAT DO THEY DO? None of these questions, which are actually quite basic, are ever answered. Venetia was commissioned to photograph the \\"artifacts\\" of the society. Do you know that not one of them is ever described?2. What was the formula? What was it supposed to do? Again, no information. Just in the very last pages, what happened if you drank it, but what was its purpose?3. The editorial and artistic decisions made in printing this book just made me MAD! The print is so big I could read it without my reading glasses and I DID NOT buy the large print edition. Each chapter begins on the right hand page and half way down, at that. This results in totally blank pages, half blank pages and enough white space between other chapter endings and new chapter beginnings to form another blank page. I actually added it all up. At a conservative estimate I got over 63 blank pages (or their equivalent) inside this 390 page novel. Padding, padding, padding just to make it into a long enough length for a hardcover book. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the paperback version. FIX THIS! Also, the print is done in a washed out grey, not crisp black. Why? For atmosphere? Did I mention that the margins were \\"generous\\"?4. The heroine, Venetia Milton, was (according to my way of thinking) cold and calculating. This was supposed to be because she was \\"modern\\" in her thinking for the late Victorian era. She chose to seduce Gabriel Jones after finishing her photography job at Arcane House because it was an isolated location so there was not much likelyhood of getting caught, she would never see him again, and she was on the shelf because of her age and family obligations. She wanted to find out what passion between a man and woman was like but never wanted to get married. When she thought he had died she was sad enough to cry, rub his coat (which she had kept with her even though all her clothes and photographic equipment was left behind-but not the camera-during her flight from danger)and then decide that life must go on. She became a \\"widow\\" in London to ease her way into business and used Mrs. Jones as a name because he wouldn't be needing it anymore. Cold folks, cold. When he \\"came back from the dead\\", she considered him an inconvenience. There was no joy in seeing him, they never even touched! Good heavens, she called him \\"sir\\" for well over 2/3 of the book! And please, Ms Quick/Krentz, what in the world were you doing with the Janus Club stuff? Just more \\"modern\\" thinking? In order to provide a reason for blackmail? Very, very weak.5. The paranormal \\"gifts\\" these two characters had were piddly. She saw \\"auras\\", he \\"felt evil\\". Whoop-de-do! I kept waiting for something else to be revealed, but that was it. Sum total of their paranormal abilities. Why was it necessary for this novel to be set in late Victorian England in order to set up the contemporary novel under the Jayne Ann Krentz banner? This one is dull and boring. That is my opinion. Others love it and have praised it to the skies. I love other Amanda Quick books, just not this one. It is totally forgetable for me and I will never want to read it again.In short, it would have made a passably good 100 page short story. Nothing more.*****As an update, I saw the paperback version of this book in the bookstore yesterday and I'm happy to say that the publishers did address (to some degree) the problems of blank pages and other editorial decisions mentioned in my review. If you want to read this one, for goodness sakes get it in paperback.*****"},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I've read almost all of Amanda Quick's romances and most of her work as Krentz. I liked Lie by Moonlight better than Second Sight because it seemed less predictable. Regardless, her writing is a notch above other romance novelists and it is always good for fast easy read with likeable characters and just the right amount of steam. If you are looking for great literature along the lines of something by John Steinbeck this is not it of course, but sometimes you need a little chocolate and a romance."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"This is a book you will either love or hate.The book starts of with the two main characters Venetia and Gabriel together in a room. You kind of feel you missed them getting to know each other as they've already been together a week.The main story of this book is that Gabriel Jones is presumed dead after a break-in at the house they were both staying at. So for Venetia to open her own business and not have to face prejudice she decide to pretend she is married and takes the surname, you've guessed it Jones.Now he is dead, right, so what has Ms Venetia to fear? Well guess what Gabriel isn't dead, he's pretending, so he can flush out the real murderer who he want to think that he is dead. Confused. Don't be. It's quite simple when you read it.Anyway Gabriel reads the paper one morning with his cousin in attendance and he knows straight away this woman who is a photographer, who has his surname, is Venetia. So he decided to go to her and see what she is about.He puts the tale about he is her dead husband returned from the dead. The tabloids weave a romantic story out of this. It's really her own fault.Now keep in mind Venetia has a special ability, she has paranormal gifts, but so to does Mr Jones. So they have some things in common. This is focused on a bit throughout the book. You also meet Venetia's family who are involved in the family business and her younger brother at times is quite funny with the way he says thing and then Gabriel's family are rather interesting also.Anyway to sum it up, this was funny in parts and a very enjoyable read for any Amanda Quick fan.

I bought the unabridged library edition and admit that it seemed a bit long, but listening to Anne Flosnik read the story definitely helped. Ms. flosnik's reading style and accent totally take me right to England and I can picture everything that is happening. The main characters are likable and are presented in an average mystery/light romance.

I wolfed down the paperback in a few hours. It's not a cozy murder mystery; it's a romance thriller with an intrigue.Though the characters in this book were on the anemic side and the plot a little murky, I still enjoyed the story a lot. The mystical properties held by the central characters were interesting to this first time Amanda Quick reader.I realize that the paranormal presented in Second Sight is a measly scrap for ardent pursuers of supernatural centered stories. Still, the tasty bit served in this book roused my enthusiastic curiosity for more.Also the seduction scenes were fun too! The few scenarios sizzled on the pages on Second Sight. Judiciously placed, the few trysts add a spicy tang to the story without overwhelming the reader's senses.It was my first book from this author and I'm looking forward to more - under her real name of Jayne Ann Krentz or by her pseudonyms.

The author, writing under multiple pen names, has novels with this world view in both the late Victorian era and modern times. This is the first (chronologically) set in the 19th century and begins a series of at least three. (White Lies and The Perfect Poison follow.) I accidentally read them out of order, but each is sufficiently self-contained that it didn't matter too much. The &#34;bodice ripper&#34; sections seemed rather formulaic - spinster decides to get laid, target is in the Arcane Society, she has magic too, he &#34;takes&#34; her virginity, they beat the bad guys and get married. The individual plots are interesting though and it's a nice adventure as you learn more about the Author's theories of magic and how they relate to good vs. evil plotting. I picked up these because I really enjoy Mercedes Lackey's Elemental Masters series. These have more sex and less plot, but they're still quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I just loved this book!The characters are engaging, dynamic, and quite entertaining!

On a mission to discover who stole the recipe for the founder's formula, he embarks on a mission that can cost him his life and the lives of those he cares for. His protective nature, sense of humor, and compassion are a perfect match for Venetia and make him an excellent and thrilling hero.The characters in the plot from young Edward to Gabriel's parents are wonderfully scripted!

There wasn't much suspense. The evil one was pretty easy to identify and I'm not sure there weren't loose ends. The way people spoke was quite stiff; Victorians may have talked that way, but I wouldn't think so. The convention of the single girl with responsibility for younger siblings was there, but the younger siblings had little character or anything to make them stand out.At the end when everything was explained, the characters just took turns explaining what happened. Even the younger sister who really hadn't been involved in the plot had a piece to say about it all.The hero was a rather silly person who worried about his psychic powers making him a throwback, but fell in love with the heroine immediately (though she, like a modern, rather than Victorian woman, just wanted a night of illicit passion - another convention for these novels, in fact, this one used by this author already). In Victorian times, this is not credible. I was thinking how she could easily have gotten pregnant. She was only 27!

It got off to a good start, but gradually declined into a boring state of affairs. I was finding myself wondering why the pace was so slow and ponderous while Gabriel's, Venetia's, and possibly Caleb's lives were in danger. I was wondering WHERE is this book going and WHEN are we going to get there!?? UGH! The logic behind their strategy to unravel the murders and mystery was so weak. For what is supposed to be a romance, there was no sexual chemistry beyond the initial contact. Gabriel seemed pretty dull. Venetia pretty stiff while flaunting the \\"I gotta be an independent female\\" thing. I made it halfway through - to the scene when Venetia dressed as a man - and it just put me over the edge. It's like the author was just writing whatever to fill the pages - so insipid and cliched. I can't waste my time reading this stuff when there are so many good books to be had. What a disappointment. I won't be rushing into reading any other books by this author."},{"Title":"Second Sight (The Arcane Society, Book 1)","review":"I was very impressed with this work and read her later books because of it.

As they fall in love, they team up to uncover killers, blackmailers, and thieves who covet both their secrets in a world filled with masquerades in which SECOND SIGHT can prove misleading.This is a delightful Victorian romantic suspense with a touch of the paranormal. The story line balances the kissing scenes with the perilous escapades so that the audience obtains a quick-paced fun thriller. Venetia is a wonderful protagonist struggling with her secrets including her desire for her \\"late\\" employer while Gabriel battles his enemies but has revised his life goals as he reciprocates his employee's desires.

In some of these stories, the metaphors and symbols Bass attempts to draw are lost on me--either too bizarre or too obscure or too complex. But there are some truly beautiful moments here, particularly in the stories &quot;Antlers&quot; and &quot;Fires.&quot; Bass is most successful when his stories are deeply rooted in a place he knows well, and when his plot lines are relatively simple. Both stories mentioned above deal centrally with human relationships: fear and longing. Set in a carefully wrought landscape (in the case of these two stories, northwest Montana), the people and places come alive in a way than few other writers (except maybe Wendell Berry) can emulate. I do recommend this book, but I would more enthusiastically recommend some of Bass' nonfiction, especially &quot;Winter,&quot; &quot;The Lost Grizzlies,&quot; and &quot;The Book of Yaak.&quot; Also, his book of short stories, &quot;Platte River,&quot; has some lovely moments.

If you are a first time reader of Bass, start with Winter: Notes from Montana and then grab this one as a follow up."},{"Title":"In the Loyal Mountains","review":"I rather liked this book as it has a slow flowing feel to it. On the surface all the stories have a slow moving rhythm to them that does not appear to have much meaning but if you look beyond there is a lot to see."},{"Title":"In the Loyal Mountains","review":"A man who has lived on the side of a mountain, without electricity, can write this. I know because I have done this, and known these men. I know also because the words of a human to not escape me rapidly; they hold long, they resist my temptation to decipher them, they are just. Rick Bass' collection is profound in it's robust depiction of landscape, and emotion. What I am talking about here is the landscapes and emotions of a range of mountains, inland lakes, deep-skies, and, the people who come to live around this. There is not a word ill-spent, not a moment of observant hesitation. The book is round as a planet, a place made whole by its presence in the lap of the reader, calmly and steadfastly apart of the tales in this book as if they experiences already had.I praise and will continue to praise Rick's work of mountain and cold-stream. His thing is truly a fossil we should keep on our shelves, revisiting with a renewed clarity each time. Bass' movement is remarkably similar to the white-noise of a waterscape, a small fall, a large fall; winter's hearkening of bears out into the open. It is a glistening verbal representation of nature's big reality: food, wind, snow, bear, mountain."},{"Title":"In the Loyal Mountains","review":"Not every story is going to connect at one particular time and place, but this collection is about as good as such things get. Very good writer*. I need to try one of his novels."},{"Title":"In the Loyal Mountains","review":"The truly orgasmic experience of reading Rick Bass' book has made me rethink my initial take on Cold Mountain - hailed by Mr. Bass himself as the book to end all need to read other books... Bass' work has made me reshape my look at the cosmos and step back in awe. Even the manor in which the book is typeset creates a longing in my soul for an existence in which reading this book provides my sole physical sustenance. I may be too bold in saying that all books be burned save this and perhaps Cold Mountain to keep us all from wasting our time pondering anything else."},{"Title":"In the Loyal Mountains","review":"This collection of short stories does not rise to the level of the recent work of Mr. Bass as seen in the New Yorker. Starting slowly and awkwardly, the stories merit and skill increase till the final stories which show great promise.

It should be mandatory reading for all politicians &amp; law enforcement personnel."},{"Title":"Disciples of Destruction","review":"This is one of the two most amazing pieces of reasearch I have ever read in my life. We give our loyalty, money and even our lives without question to ancient creeds of our forefathers. I was given this book by Mr. Sutherland in Wash., DC years ago when I photographed him for it's press release, and stuck it in my book case. I had no idea what I had. Years later after a life changing experience, it appeared like magic - with all the answers I sought. Mr. Sutherland puts everything in a logical order so you can get the big picture. My copy is ragged and highlighted now - I came here in hopes of finding a new copy to buy for my daughter.If religion cannot stand up to scrutiny, then it must be re-vamped or discarded. I did sense Mr. Sutherlands' respect for the real Jesus, who is nowhere to be seen in the 2000 year old Roman religion that stole his name.Disciples of Destruction should be required reading for all free thinkers along with \\"The Unseen Hand\\" by RALPH EPPERSON, wich covers government in much the same way."},{"Title":"Disciples of Destruction","review":"I found D of D to be a very interesting and honest assessment of religious origins. Sutherland explores chronologically, from Judaism, to Christianity, to Islam, ending with Communism. The latter may seem peculiar given the scope of the discussion but it is apropos. Sutherland wants to explain why people act in a collective manner, what binds them. He also wants people to honestly examine and explore the reality behind the myths."},{"Title":"Disciples of Destruction","review":"On reflection of 9/11 and the upsurge of terrorist attacks, and how the Christian religious right has become so influential in American government (ie. George W. Bush says that God told him to invade Iraq), this book is even more relevant than when it was first published in 1987.And Sutherland's passion to his work is infectious. He influenced me to renounce my Roman Catholic upbringing and to become an atheist -- and I'm a better person for it. I'm free of the God delusion. If everyone...yes, everyone! The world would be a kinder place. No more killin' in the name of God."},{"Title":"Disciples of Destruction","review":"\`Disciples of Destruction' is an insightful look into the specious origins of the three great religions: Christianity, Islam, and their progenitor Judaism. In the final section Sutherland also addresses Communism as a theological belief system, sharing the endemic qualities of dogmatic and fanatical belief in the face of evidence to the contrary, among many other nefarious distinctions.Each section unfolds in essentially the same manner. First the origin myths are explained in less than flattering, but perhaps, more objective terms. The development of the belief system follows, with a focus on the creation of the religious institution and the doctrinal line. Each section is concluded with a look at the current (the book was published in 1987) state and affects of the religion on humanity, focusing mainly on the continued suffering these belief systems continue to spawn.Religion and politics, always open to opinion and interpretation; but the great value that Sutherland brings to us in his book is an analysis that interprets the facts in a way that is consistent with general human desires, motivations and behavior, things that have remained constant throughout humanity's short history and that explain these \`miraculous' events in terms that we see today (i.e. the prevalence of charlatans), and without an appeal to an outside entity. Whether trying, as one reviewer put it, to undo dogmatic programming, or simply looking for the truth (as opposed to the \\"truth\\"), as best fits the evidence, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Disciples of Destruction","review":"The sub-title (which Amazon unfortunately omits) reads:\\"The Religious Origins of War and Terrorism\\"I bought and read this book back in 1987 when it wasfirst published. It made for an impressive read then,but I could not have fully appreciated what Sutherlandhas to say here until recent years.This book is more timely than ever, and helps usunderstand the mind of those who perpetrate violencein the name of religion.I ***HIGHLY*** recommend this book to all.Happy Holidays!"},{"Title":"Disciples of Destruction","review":"I found out years ago that most historians of europian back-ground have in many cases based their writings, facts, reports etc. on distuction, lies ; espicially in dealing with people of African Descent .

This book is an invitation to think about Jesus' role in history, both for oneself and for others. I do not nearly agree with all the views presented, but some of the questions Cobb poses still are with me and continue to challenge me, as often the answer in the Bible is (relatively) clear, but the people one might discuss those questions with probably won't accept the Bible's authority. My roommate and I had a lengthy discussion on whether this thinking is for everyone or limited to the intellectually and theologically interested - a first outcome of having read this book. You, too, might find yourself thinking at the end of this book - or you will most likely have laid it aside in indignation."},{"Title":"Doubting Thomas: Christology in Story Form","review":"Thomas, who was brought up Christian, is now being confronted by different views from with in and with out the church. He is given an opportunity to witness to some Buddhists and at that moment realizes he does not know what to believe. How will he resolve this dilemma?I am not sure whom this book is trying to address. John Cobb gets to play both sides of the fence in asking genuinely interesting questions and giving fairly decent answers. However in the process he leads both sides to his conclusion. There is much to make you think and there is even a section (Discussion Questions) that clearly state the questions that arise in the book."},{"Title":"Doubting Thomas: Christology in Story Form","review":"I red the French Translation, the title of which is &quot;Thomas pris de doutes&quot;.

Pastors in ERF are among 490 persons among which around 50 ladies.So you can get an idea of the way it may impact the main part of French readers."},{"Title":"Ladies of Soul (American Made Music)","review":"How many times have I gone to a club and watched fabulous singers give astounding performances and ended up asking myself, &quot;why isn't she/he a star?&quot; Many of these entertainers are professionals, but for some reason, have not achieved the heights that many other, equally talented people have.My record collection is filled with such artists: Howard Tate, Loleatta Holloway, Syl Johnson, Vanetta Fields, Otis Clay, Anna King, Shirley Brown and many others.Author, David Freeland, obviously felt the same way, as he set out to showcase seven unheralded female soul singers from '60s, by giving them some overdue recognition in his new book, &quot;Ladies of Soul&quot;. Among them are some of my personal favorites, starting with the incomparable, Bettye LaVette (&quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot;), who knocked me out when I first heard her demanding voice on the radio singing &quot;You Killed the Love&quot;. I had no idea that this singer was only in her teens, for she emoted like an experienced woman of 40. That voice was coarse, even nasty at times, pleading and fraught with the damages of cigarettes, booze and life. Many feel she has a &quot;churchy&quot; sound, but LaVette swears that she is a child of the blues. Wherever it came from, that voice affected me deeply. Since, I have seen her bear witness, &quot;live&quot; in performance, giving 110% of herself and working harder than Tina Turner during her torrid times with Ike. Tina, by the way, covered Bettye's first hit record, &quot;My Man (He's a Lovin' Man)&quot;.Maxine Brown is gifted singer who has had many hits and deserves the spotlight in this book. Her immense talent has grown with experience and she is one of the best soul singers around. One of her big hits, &quot;Oh No Not My Baby&quot; was later recorded by Aretha Franklin.The misunderstood, Timi Yuro, who's career and voice puzzled many (some thought she was a man, others were convinced she was African-American). She's Italian and has a soul as deep as the rivers. As a young girl, not only did she sing opera to appease her father, she sang in black churches (thanks to a religious black nanny) and toured later, as a professional, with the icons of soul like Little Richard and Etta James on the chitlin' circuit. She was asked by Frank Sinatra to tour Australia with him in the late 60s and her records were produced by such giants as Quincy Jones and Clyde Otis. Timi's first hit, &quot;Hurt&quot;, was covered by Elvis Presley.David Freeland has done a remarkable job with his hands on research and wasted not a second, quoting what others had written on this subject. He traveled the USA and found these women and interviewed them, in person, in depth. It seems that he quickly became the vehicle they could utilize to voice their anger, frustration, exhilaration and hope.Also fascinating, were Freeland's conversations with Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, whose candid insights into achieving success in the record business (then and now) and the unpredictable tastes of the record buying public were truly telling. Frank perceptions into the lives of many soul performers were punctuated by Juggy Murray, founder of Sue Records.David interviewed DJ's, engineers...numerous people who make their living in the recording industry. This gives his book its distinctive authenticity.I was not familiar with the personal life of Denise LaSalle (&quot;Trapped, By this Thing Called Love&quot;), before reading this book. Over the years I have purchased her albums and enjoyed her brassy brand of r &amp; b. After reading her story, I conclude that she is substantive, opinionated and also a savvy, smart business woman. Carla Thomas (&quot;Gee Whiz&quot;) turns out to be an interesting character. Her career sizzled just below the boiling point and she never achieved the stardom she deserved. It was also interesting to read about Barbara Mason (&quot;Yes, I'm Ready&quot;), whose records I've enjoyed over the years, and to get to know the one singer I wasn't familiar with, Ruby Johnson.The book is not just &quot;I made this record and sang with this person&quot;, it covers the morose as well, not only in the music industry, but societal injustice, as well. Travels through the south, having to deal with the America's ugliest demon, racism, brushes with the Ku Klux Klan, all are undeniably apart of these scenarios.Very revealing are the observations by Bettye LaVette regarding the city of Detroit, during the heyday of Motown. Hers is a much darker portrayal of the same occurrences that were described in other books like Mary Wilson's, the Temptations' or Martha Reeves' biographies.The important accomplishment here, is that this book stimulates one's appetite to hear these grand ladies sing! Enter their names on any Internet search engine and you'll find more information on each of them. Thankfully, they have CDs in the large record stores or can be ordered online."},{"Title":"Ladies of Soul (American Made Music)","review":"David has written a compelling, honest and excellent tome on a diverse range of soul sisters some of whom have never received the mainstream recognition enjoyed by others. That he would take time out to track down Ruby Johnson and Timi Yuro and include such soulful divas as Bettye Lavette, Maxine Brown and Carla Thomas is to his eternal credit; I'm hopeful that there will be a follow-up since there are other women who deserve the kind of truth-telling treatment he offers.

Howard Koch tells us the story, from when he was selected to write the radio play, the panic and terror that the forty-five minute show had caused, to the aftermath as newspaper editors, the public and the government tried to decide how to stop something like this from happening WITHOUT taking away the people's rights.The book also has a copy of the complete script, a introductory interview with Arthur C. Clarke and even a chapter on his visit to Grovers Mill where the people were friendly and didn't seem mad at him at all.Also the author uses fascinating data from 'The Invasion From Mars' by Hadley Cantril, a study of the psychology of panic, to help explain WHY the events unfolded as they did. Lots of photos finish off the book. A good book, but not a great one."},{"Title":"Catbird's Song","review":"A special treat is getting inside the mind and marrow of a truly great master craftsman and getting the inside secrets and distilled quintessence of the whats and how to's of creating great, lasting art. The best essay is the short piece on fellow Massachusetts poet, the late Robert Francis. While much of Francis' work is trivial, though technically proficient, his masterpiece has to be Sheep: 'From where I stand the sheep stand still/As stones against the stony hill./The stones are gray/ And so are they./ And both are weatherworn and round,/Leading the eye back to the ground./Two mingled flocks - /The sheep, the rocks./ And still no sheep stirs from its place/Or lifts its Babylonian face.' Wilbur writes how grateful he is for its perfection. Other essays include those on Tennyson, Poe, Milton and one of his favorite subjects: Riddles, alone worth the price of the book. Instead of signing up for a poetry workshop, get this book and its companion Responses: Prose Pieces 1953-76 and go to school with the Master of Rhymecraft."},{"Title":"A Time for Tea: Women, Labor, and Post/Colonial Politics on an Indian Plantation (a John Hope Franklin Center Book)","review":"I read this book immediately after its publication and eventually assigned a few sections to one of my classes.

Portions of the book will make you gasp, as you read that some believed that only virgins could pick the tea leaves, since non-virgins would destroy the leaves by merely touching the leaves!Chatterjee's writing evokes the images of what it is like for these women who worked and continue to work on the tea plantations. Her research was extensive in the field. The book is historical, political, and analytical. It isn't written for a lay audience, but I'm sure that most would enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"The Teacher Who Could Not Count","review":"My big sister first gave me this book after she bought it at a school book fair.

It delves more deeply than the AW in enabling you to identify, clarify, nurture and fulfil your creative desires. It is very well-structured and comprehensive. Ignore, if they bother you, the \`new agey' bits: there's much sensible material to be found here. I completed it in about four months without expense (I adapted, or omitted, the exercises if I didn't have the materials). I wrote my narrative time line in less than 2 weeks. It doesn't have to be anywhere near 100 pages: it can be any length you like. (Spending an hour or so a day, for a week or two, on the time line should suffice for most readers.) Unlike the AW, this book does not specify the time you should take for each section. I see that as a positive feature: it is for the reader to determine his/her pace. Yes, it's quite big, too wordy in places, and seems daunting, but it isn't necessary to do every exercise (or every chapter). The seminal sections for me were the ones on story, attitude and sight. Idid the book while learning to draw and would recommend doing it alongside your creative work if possible. If you've bought it and can't face doing all of it, try the sections on story and attitude: they're very good."},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","review":"I began using The Vein of Gold about a year after I had begun The Artist's Way, the start of my self-development. If you don't want to do any assignments, you may want a different author. The key to Julia's method is DO SOMETHING.The Artist's Way was good in many ways, but mainly for helping me create a discipline for myself at home. The Morning Pages are definitely an exercise in self-discipline, and they continue to be an essential part of Julia Cameron's format. I wrote Morning Pages daily for about three years, but stopped after I had been working as a web site copywriter/designer for almost a year. Then I began drawing regularly instead.The perspective of The Vein of Gold worked better for me than The Artist's Way did. The artist's dates were easy since they didn't have to be done solo. My husband went with me, and we continue to have artist's dates regularly. (A big breakthrough for us was when we bought fingerpainting supplies. Fingerpainting was theraputic and fun for us.)If you have a dream (being an artist, musician, whatever), take steps to make it happen. And start now."},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","review":"The Vein of Gold goes deeper than the Artist's Way does. (AW was just the tip of the iceberg.) There is about 19 weeks of work in this book if you take your time. You &quot;write your life to right it.&quot;This book continues the practice of the morning pages and the artist's dates but also gives you more assignments to do and more time to do some of them. If you are on the creative path to recovery I would highly recommend you work with this book.You can jump right in but you might want to do the Artist's Way first. I faciliate groups using both books and find that the group energy adds to the synchronicity and security of having the same processes at the same time.There are lovely quotes and sharing processes within the book. The sections are called &quot;Kingdoms&quot; and you explore and delve into your life story in a manner you may not have thought of yourself.If you are on the creative pathway and want to move forward in your development --get this book!"},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","review":"Julia Cameron has done it again.

Then I stumbled upon this author's name and her book &quot;The Artist's Way&quot; in Sarah Ban Breathnach's books. So, of course, I picked up the Artist's Way at the library and started my own morning pages. That was 3 years ago. What has happened since? Well, I stopped doing the pages after 2 months (I was &quot;busy&quot;) and I've been kinda wandering ever since. Lo and behold I stumbled upon this book, bought it used at a library sale and am back to those damn (ha-ha) morning writings. Well, I must tell you that this woman is a genius. Not only have these pages been quite an inspiration and a positive flow for me, but the &quot;assignments&quot; she asks you to undertake are life changing. I am a much more positive person and that shows in my writings. Let me stress to you that I am NOT a writer of any sort, my creativity has not shown it's full colors yet (they are dim, but they're there)and I get writer's cramp and I whine about doing it, but I DO IT and am a better person for it.

I just knew like you know. Traumatic life experiences during childhood, tragic episodes, etc. It doesn't really matter how you got disconnected with your inner artist child only that it's possible to reconnect right now if you pick up Julia Cameron's book: The Artist Way and work through the exercises. Your life will change for real. The Vein of Gold (the sequel to the Artist's Way) focuses on finding your specific source of treasure/talent. Both books ensure that you will stay well-connected to your inner artist child and not lose him/her ever again.There are no short cuts, but Julia Cameron's program works. I don't know why it works, but it does. Before you do one more thing to improve or change your life buy both books and do the exercises faithfully. I still journal, take artist dates and buy little gifts for my inner artist child. Why? It works, but I would have never made the connection without these two wonderful books. The books are like treasure maps to find the treasure (the gold) in you.

I actually did some of the exercises in this book, whereas in the Artist's Way, I was too bored to finish with the thing..."},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","review":"Julia Cameron's books should be mandatory coursework in all creative writing classes or any kind of dramatic and performing arts programs around the world! Luminous, loving, and healing are the trademarks of her artistic recovery programs. Climb this mountain and find your creative muse! The book follows a weekly development plan to exacavate the voice within. A gradual mentorship no matter where you are on the journey to expressing your artistic birthright.Don't we all have a story to tell that is uniquely our own? Or perhaps there is that song that is one which places us in our element like nothing else? And then again, there are those stage roles that seem written just for us, or are they? The answer in Julia Cameron's Vein of Gold is ... YES! Cameron describes in her book how the actor Robert De Niro seems born to play certain mystery roles and when he steps out of them the thespian magic seems to disappear. This is the basis for the Vein of Gold, which followed the very successful Artist's Way, as a 12-week study in artistic recovery.The Vein of Gold continues upon Cameron's practice of morning pages, artist dates to be taken solo, and a series of tasks designed to coax out the creative child. Each chapter begins with a rich collection of Cameron's wisdom as a professional writer herself and follows a particular theme. Readers are encouraged to stay on each theme presented in the chapter, such as abundance, and do homework assignments such as a collage or add decoration to their living space. The point of this is to draw out in a reader what is uniquely their own story, song, or poem to birth. In the commercial world of art, Cameron notes, a lot is being quantified by how much money a movie earned, how much a painting was sold for, or how many hits songs a record spawned. This message is often what gets in the way of finding one's vein of gold because the artists believes that they must deliver art that is \\"acceptable\\" rather than \\"authentic\\". In the Vein of God, Cameron strives to draw out what is already there and meant to expressed rather than mould a person's art into a template of popular opinion.Beyond the 12 distinct chapters, the book is divided into kingdoms to illustrate the kind of inner journey that Cameron is taking her students on. Each kingdom (sight, story, sound, attitude, relationship, and spirituality) reflects the kind of \\"sense\\" training that is intended to help readers excavate their own vein of gold as practical exercises probe leading questions into the psyche. What Cameron wants is for those who seek their inner gold, to not only find it, but to claim it as theirs alone.The Buddha once said that there are three things never hidden for long: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Finding gold in the hills of our inner life is only possible through the truth. Cameron's Vein of Gold is a literary prospector's guide to seeing our truth underneath all the beliefs, emotions, and patterns we have long hidden under."},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","review":"Plumbing the depths to find the creative you is done as ever it can be done with this book. Julia Cameron takes the reader on a series of journies to find the nature of relationships, spirituality, the senses of sight and sound,the nature of one's attitudes all leading to the discovery that all things are possible. When those possibilites are realized they are expored and it is that exploration that opens up the creative soul.A great book."},{"Title":"The Vein of Gold: Journey to Your Creative Heart","review":"I have read nearly all of Julia's books and out of the popular Artist's way and Walking Through The World, I have to say that Vein of Gold is her best one yet and definitely the best one out of the three. It covers things mentioned in both previous books and adds new information to it in a fun way. I enjoyed the exercises that were far more relevant this time around and I've gone through the book at least three times by now. It's been fun and interesting each time through and I learn something new with every round.It's helpful for folks who've been writing for a while or are familiar with Julia's books, but haven't purchased any of them as yet.

Mention Japanese literature and the average Westerner is likely to think of Kazuo Ishiguro - a citizen of Britain who writes in English - or, if they are particularly well read, Mishima Yukio. However, anyone who actually takes the trouble to read Japanese literature will discover one of the finest and most distinguished literary traditions in the world. And within that tradition Nagai Kafu holds a small, but unique and fascinating place. Kafu wrote most of his work in the early half of the century, soon after the westernisation of Japan had properly set in, and his work is therefore full of peculiarly Japanese problems to do with the preservation or disappearance of Japanese tradition. However, Kafu's universality is his very particularity. By focusing lovingly on the details of a corner of the world's history that is disappearing before his eyes, he evokes within us all the great sadness of changes and creates a timeless sense of longing and nostalgia. Nor is that all. While his work may at first appear only relevant to a limited timeand place, it should soon be clear that his work has increasing relevance today, since it questions the vain ambitions of materialism and the ethics of the 'progress' that are uglifying the world and laying waste to older, more spiritual and picturesque traditions. This volume contains a fascinating biography of the man and Seidensticker's translations of several of Kafu's stories. The stories are undoubtedly the highlight of the volume, and I would urge the reader to look to these before reading Seidensticker's arrogant and narrow-minded comments in the biography. The bad points of this book spring from this arrogance, for Seidensticker refuses to judge Japanese literature within the Japanese tradition and looks always for literary qualities now considered outdated even in the West. An example of this arrogance is the fact that of some of the stories, he does not deign to translate the whole text, judging, &quot;This does not spoil the dramatic unity of this piece, for it had none to begin with.&quot; Surely that is for the reader to decide. It is very sad that Seidensticker's attitude, one now decried by academics within the field of Japanology, mars this otherwise lyrical and elegant volume. Particularly reccomended ofthe stories are the elegiac Coming Down with a Cold and Quiet Rain, both of which are beautifully rendered sketches of the shadowy world of the geisha, which Kafu loved and drew on for inspiration."},{"Title":"Pianos Around the Cape","review":"My immediate response to &quot;Pianos Around the Cape&quot; is to borrow Glenna Luschei's remarkable phrase:&quot;dashing from beauty to beauty&quot; There is such diversity in her poetry and the ability to catch the essence of thoughts and emotions common to humanity. The &quot;seemingly simple&quot; style tends to make the reader forget what skill and craft lie behind all of this generous outpouring.....there is honesty, deceny and celebratory music in her poetry plus the underlying humor and ability to see things as they are. Is her work serious and often tragic? Yes but it is but it is also moving and affective without a hint of sentimentality. It would be difficult to single out lines or phrases that captivated me, but the following have been set in memory:&quot;Flaws make us perfect.&quot;....&quot;rocking chair, oh mesadora/ I rock myself on one arm/ my children on the other&quot;.....&quot;we are lodged in the whale of the Andes?

Scott Fitzgerald","review":"I've admired Fitzgerald all my life and regard his work as singularly underrated as time goes on. He was a brilliant and witty writer who could turn a phrase as well as any American author of the 20th century. This biography is the best I've ever read on Fitzgerald. It's particularly strong in the depiction of his gaudy, booze-soaked life with Zelda, especially when they were ex-pats living in France. Bruccoli really draws the reader in with deft descriptions of their marital rows, woes, break-ups and innumerable reconcilations. I was happy to see that their daughter, Scottie, was also illuminated so brilliantly.The material on Sheila Graham, Scott's lover in Hollywood, was also intriguing. Graham's own book about Scott is a great read, but the author brings out elements to the story which Graham omitted. I was genuinely sad when Scott dies and the narrative concludes. The debauchery, booze and high times of the Flapper era are all here. This is a highly recommended, beautifully tribute to one of the great writers of the past 100 years."},{"Title":"Some sort of epic grandeur: The life of F. Scott Fitzgerald","review":"I am an absolute diehard fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, both his life and his literature. So, I knew when I purchased this book I was bound to scrutinize its every nook and cranny. Well, my scrutiny proved to be a wasted effort. Without question, Matthew Bruccoli is the number one Fitzgerald scholar in the country, and after reading this biography, it is impossible to question why.Bruccoli covers every aspect of Fitzgerald's life and includes several bits of correspondence to really give readers a look inside Fitzgerald's thinking. --Perhaps my favorite thing about the book is that it does not sentimentalize the author (which I myself have a habit of doing). Fitzgerald is spelled out here in all his glory, yet, we also get to see his unflattering side...paranoia, arrogance, unharnessed alcoholism, and downright neurosis.F Scott Fitzgerald was a brilliant man whose life became legend. It is my humble opinion that Bruccoli has written the most thorough and best possible biography. Simply put, the read is fascinating. It might be 600 pages, but you will fly through it. It is \\"never dry\\" (like Fitzgerald :)) and always entertaining. For Fitzgerald fanatics like myself, this book is a must, but I am convinced that anyone who takes to \\"human interest\\" stories would find themselves engulfed in its pages.Also recommended: \\"The Romantic Egoists\\"...a scrapbook collection put together concerning the lives of the Fitzgeralds. It is packed with pictures and is a wonderful companion to the biography. It was also published by Bruccoli."},{"Title":"Some sort of epic grandeur: The life of F. Scott Fitzgerald","review":"From the preeminent Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli, this book's remarkable thoroghness and honesty is refreshing. Bruccoli gives the oft misunderstood Fitzgerald a human, albeit, reverent study, exploring beyond the overemphasized alcoholism into the realms of insecurity and sensitivity that had an indelible effect on Fitzgerald's work. The book reads well, without the burden of overly scholarly analysis, making it suitable reading either for doctoral study or simply for a summer beach day."},{"Title":"Some sort of epic grandeur: The life of F. Scott Fitzgerald","review":"I bought this book and read it before reading any of the works of F. Scott Fitgerald.The book opens with an interesting literary hook as we follow the last few hours in the life of Fitzgerald on December 21, 1940. He is an unemployed screen writer living in Hollywood at the apartment of his companion Sheilah Graham. On the previous day, he had symptoms of a heart problem. That morning on the 21st, he was working on \\"The Last Tycoon.\\" He was sitting in a chair, stood up, grasped the mantlepiece, collapsed, and died at age 44.That book is one of seemingly dozens of short stories on F. Scott, Zelda his wife, and others. The book is not a seamless story but is a chronoligcal collection of short - almost disconnected - stories about his life and works.It is an excellent reference book to consult as you read the works of Fitzgerald. I found the book on its own too dry with too many facts and it gives no idea of what the writing was like. It was not until I read \\"This Side of Paradise\\" did I understand what all the fuss was about with F. Scott Fitzgerald, and it was at that point the present biography came to life. For example, I quote a passage from Chapter 2 of Book I, as Amory sits on the steps of his dorm at Princeton after his first day on campus:\\"Now, far down the shadowy line of University Place a white-clad phalanx broke the gloom, and marching figures, white-shirted, white-trousered, swung rhythmically up the street, with linked arms and heads thrown back:\\"Going back-going back,Going-back-to-Nas-sau-Hall,Going back-going back-To the-Best-Old-Place-of-All.Going back-going back,From all-this-earth-ly-ball,We'll-clear-the-track-as-we-go-back-Going-back-to-Nas-sau-Hall!\\"Amory closed his eyes as the ghostly procession drew near. The song soared so high that all dropped out except the tenors, who bore the melody triumphantly past the danger-point and relinquished it to the fantastic chorus. Then Amory opened his eyes, half afraid that sight would spoil the rich illusion of harmony.\\"One learns more about Fitgerald's writing from that passage than the entire biography.Having said the above, this is a fact filled reference book that acts as a wondeful guide and supplement to the F. Scott's life and the background for the works. There are many photographs and other documents among the 61 short chapters. I especially liked the ledger notes that were kept by Fitzgerald that clearly outline the characters and plot details for the books. Bruccoli has included a huge notes section and appendix at the back of the book, about 100 illustrations, plus many more documents. I have read many interpretations of \\"Tender is the Night\\" but it is a lot clearer when you actually read the author's own notes as produced here in the present biography.Highly recommend: excellent collection of short stories and documents."},{"Title":"Some sort of epic grandeur: The life of F. Scott Fitzgerald","review":"This is an excellent biography, full of a great wealth of detail. In truth, Fitzgerald is a pretty easy biographical subject, because his fiction was so closely based on his own life and experiences and because he wrote so many letters and kept such detailed notebooks and ledgers accounting for his own life. He also had relationships with many people (Zelda, other writers, etc.) who left behind many accounts of him. Still, Bruccoli does an extremely thorough job and the book is very well-written.I would give it five stars except for an extremely irritating tendency Bruccoli has to be dismissive of almost all of Fitzgerald's short stories. Bruccoli is way too arrogant about pronouncing dozens of the stories F. Scott wrote as being \\"minor,\\" or \\"disappointing,\\" or even \\"embarrassing,\\" while reserving his praise for a select few, such as \\"May Day\\" and \\"The Rich Boy.\\" Personally, having read every one of FSF's currently collected short stories (well over 100 in all), I don't rate \\"May Day\\" or \\"The Rich Boy\\" very highly, but I love lots and lots of the \\"commercial\\" ones Bruccoli dismisses. I think he should leave the assessment of which stories are good up to the reader. Bruccoli's literary analysis -- of Fitzgerald's novels -- is outstanding, but the short stories should not be so dismissed (even if Scott himself at times dismissed them and hated having to write them to earn money)."},{"Title":"Some sort of epic grandeur: The life of F.

I don't know what exactly the magic of this bio is- the author's exhaustive, encyclopedic knowledge of Fitzgerald, his obvious love for his subject, or the magic of Fitzgerald himself.

Reading it, I was struck by the profundity of the advice on writing he gave his daughter Scottie, which is copied in excerpts. I felt like I was getting the same benefits he gave her, and I also got the sense that he would want this. He meant what he had learned to be accessable to everyone; in a way, it was what his life was based around. Then, I got a good deal out of the analyses the biographer devotes to transcibing the process Fitzgerald went through in mapping out each of his extaordinary novels- I took notes I'll keep for ever.

Especially when I have to pay to ship it and wait. If it's clearly marked \\"easy guitar,\\" then the blame would be on me, and that has happened, but more than a few times I've picked up sheet music or tab somewhere and it's barely recognizable as the original recorded version--sometimes it's not even in the same key! And there's nothing on it that indicates this. Can we get a \\"Some Lazy Transcriber's Version Because We Don't Understand The Real Reasons People Buy This Stuff\\" stamp on those things?It's because of that that I absolutely love publisher Hal Leonard's \\"Guitar Recorded Versions\\" series. I may not ever get that \\"Lazy Transcriber\\" stamp idea off the ground, but--seriously honestly truly--when you see that logo for \\"Guitar Recorded Versions\\" on the cover of a book like this, you can rest assured it's perfect. Everything for Weezer's iconic debut is here. Every strum, every acoustic part, every solo, every lick and riff. It shouldn't be that much to ask for in general, but it is actually extremely rare, and Hal Leonard steps up to the challenge (I can say that with confidence because this isn't the only book in this series I own). I got this book 10 years ago and have enjoyed learning how to play these great songs correctly, and have had many years of entertainment in watching other guys try to play \\"Say It Ain't So\\" based off of tabs they obviously pulled off the internet that only barely sound like the song. \\"I learned to play a Weezer song!\\" No . . . no, you didn't.Understand--this is not an instructional book. There is an appendix that goes over how to interpret certain tablature symbols, since it still is (and probably always will be) a pretty unstandardized means of transcription, but you'll find no discussion or help on how to play a riff or what fingers to use where, etc. It's a songbook and that's it.

He's arrogant and bull-headed and full of anger. But in this story we get to see why... and we can hardly blame him.

She's domineering and controlling and has little use for anyone weaker than herself. So it's a good thing that Connor couldn't possibly be called weak!In time, their mutual appreciation and admiration of each other's strengths leads them to trust each other... and trust opens their hearts for love."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Love all Lynn's work. I guess you have to know your history to appreciate the story line...excellent as always!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"I got suckered into trying this by the premise of a haunted production of Hamlet. I didn't have tremendously high expectations: frothy romance, I figured. A nice change. But ... This book read like a Three Stooges film. There were moronic ghosts. There was idiotic behavior, there were prat falls, there was screaming and running and fainting. There were random acts of violence played for laughs. There was a sword pole vault. I'm a little stunned there were no kilt wardrobe malfunctions, but then I stopped reading around page 60, so anything's possible.It was evident from constant references that the writer flatters herself that anyone picking up this book will have read whatever others she has written. I didn't know she'd written any, haven't read them - and have no desire to ever do so. This book is an object lesson in how *not* to continue a series: don't assume your reader knows who all the players are. Don't assume your reader knows which are dead and which are not. Don't blurt out the key points to your other books' endings, because that takes away a great deal of the motivation to read them if one hasn't.Even aside from the above, the characters were unlikeable (I'm expected to accept that the \\"heroine\\" will continue to nurse a passion for a moron who has shown himself to be outrageously rude? Welcome to the 21st century...?). They were alternately insecure, smug, or simply annoying, and, in the case of the ghosts, caricatures. (Now that I've mentioned the Stooges, one of the ghosts is, no offence to the human, very like Moe.) The undead were horrendous parodies of characters the writer read about somewhere else, and the living characters... Evidently the ghosts' primary reason for continued existence is to play matchmaker. If these mortals couldn't find mates for themselves, they would do far better to refrain from breeding.A review elsewhere consists of \\"I have been dreaming about Connor since I read this book...yummy!\\" Seriously? A dead, mildly psychotic, none-too-bright pseudo-drill sergeant? Oh, wait - he was wearing a kilt. That explains everything. I adore Diana Gabaldon; she created a wonderful, wonderful series - but she has a great deal to answer for in the massive amounts of trash written to grab onto her coattails."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Victoria McKinnon's love life was doomed from the start. She is a twenty something stage director who has her eye set on one of her handsome leading actors. Now if only he'll look at her as a woman and not as merely a director, her life would be complete. But, unknown to her, there are three ghostly characters, two of them are her grandfathers many generations removed, who are in the business of matchmaking and they believe that they have the perfect man for her. Of course, the only problem is that Connor is a ghost.Victoria is a strong woman, independent, opinionated and runs her production company like a drill sergeant. The matchmaking trio thought she would be just perfect for Connor, never mind Connor's corporeal issues.Connor was laird of his clan many hundreds of years in the past. He married a woman from a rival clan in order to establish peace. But she ran off with a French minstrel, who ended up killing her, her two babies, and then lured Connor into a trap and murdered him as well. Since then, Connor has haunted several castles as a ghost, consumed by bitterness and hate over his murder.Victoria's brother, Thomas, has agreed to financially back her production of Hamlet and also offered loan of his castle in Scotland as a makeshift theater for her play. Victoria was elated but a bit suspicious of his motives. Unknown to Victoria, Thomas does have an ulterior motive for his offer. Thomas never got along with the bad-tempered Connor and decided the perfect revenge would be to foist his equally crabby sister on him. In fact, he was almost his glee over it. If anyone could stand up to Connor, it would be Victoria.When Connor and Victoria first meet, Connor is on the verge of a swordfight with one of her ghostly grandfathers. She intervenes, they yell a bit, and then to his astonishment, she makes him a deal: Leave her crew alone and after the play is over, he can haunt her for a number of days, plus she'll offer him a place in her play. And to further confound him, she tells him he's handsome. He sputters, grudgingly agrees to her offer and stalks off.They grow on each other, have adventures together and find themselves in love. How they solve Connor's ghostly status I won't tell but it is very heart wrenching and very scary for Victoria. Needless to say, the ghostly trio was very pleased with the match.Definitely a raucous read. I don't think I've had so much fun reading a book. The tale is simply hilarious. The ghostly characters are so eccentric, devious, and full of life. I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"This was my first Lynn Kurland novel. It began very different than the usual romance novels I have read, but quickly got boring. The relationship between the two main characters was almost platonic. No zip or fire between them at all. I had to force myself to finish the book. Will try other titles by her. i haven't given up on Ms. Kurland!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"This is a series of books on the extended family of her stories. Each book can stand alone but I collect them all so I can read them as each one happens. Wonderful books."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Great read, but must the read the other stories before this one, I made the mistake to read this first and missed out the prior stories to carry you to this one, Great love story, and heart-break for sure, i cried for the heroine while reading, could not put the book down, i had finished the story, you will enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Victoria McKinnon is more than a little suspicious when her pain-in-the-neck brother Thomas offers Thorpewold Castle for her upcoming performance of Hamlet. Who could turn down the chance to direct Shakespeare in a honest to goodness English castle? Of course if you've read \\"Three Wise Ghosts\\" (little sister Megan's novella) or MY HEART STOOD STILL (Thomas' own story) then you are in on the joke. If not then you'll just have to find out along with Victoria.Following Thomas McKinnon's return to America with his new bride Iolanthe, Connor MacDougal has assumed control of the castle as its laird. He is not unfamiliar with the responsibility, having been the laird of his own keep before his untimely murder in medieval Scotland. He is in the process of interviewing a motley crew of shades for the position of his Captain of the Guard when he is brought the news that yet another pesky MacKinnon is on the way to plague him. Connor hates all McKinnons and is determined to send this V. MacKinnon packing with \\"his\\" tail tucked between \\"his\\" legs at the first opportunity.What he hadn't expected was that V. MacKinnon was a beautiful and spirited woman. She's a canny one as well. Taking the presence of ghosts both at the Inn and at the castle in stride, she exacts a promise from Connor not to haunt her cast during their stay by promising him a part in her play. Connor like many born in his own time had never learned to read, and finds himself at the mercy of the Boar's Head Trio, the most devious group of matchmaking ghosts you'll ever come up against.Victoria, who is otherwise savvy, is blinded by her leading man who is vain and self-serving and completely oblivious to her interest in him. Connor soon finds himself loathing the man. Although he has promised to behave himself around her cast and crew the other ghosts have promised no such thing and when one of Victoria's erstwhile relatives \\"several generations removed\\" frightens away her costume man, her Grandmother throws herself into the breach.It is Grandma who actually sets things in motion inadvertently by disappearing during a picnic. Victoria's leading man turns up missing shortly afterward. Brother Thomas contacts Jamie MacLeod, who has appeared in numerous Kurland offerings as well as his own story (A DANCE THROUGH TIME), and is an expert on \\"mysterious disappearances\\" (i.e. time travel gates). With Jamie's aid, the MacKinnon's learn exactly where the two have gone and Victoria becomes determined to retrieve them. Mere moments after she arrives in the past, she begins to understand the perils of time travel. By the time she returns Victoria is completely disillusioned with her leading man, but she suspects she might be harboring strong feelings for yet another man she can never have. It's an impossible situation, or is it?Lynn Kurland is a consummate storyteller. With an incorporeal hero, she must rely on sexual tension alone to fuel the romance and she succeeds in doing so beautifully and with a great deal of humor. Much Ado in the Moonlight will keep the reader on the edge of their seat unable to put the book down until the very last word.Younger sister Jennifer is introduced in this story as an active participant in Victoria's adventures. She is single, and had been an extremely talented actress and musician. For a reason no one else is aware of, Jennifer had suddenly dropped these pursuits to assist her mother with her baby clothes business. Something is definitely awry, and knowing that the Boar's Head Trio are not about to leave any of their young descendants alone and unhappy, I have a feeling there will be a romance in store for her in the near future. Since Jennifer is not in the dark about the existence of her matchmaking ghostly relations as her siblings had been, I am waiting with breathless anticipation to see how Ms. Kurland handles that story.Reviewed by Leslie Tramposch for PNR Reviews"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book. I am a long time fan of Kurland's books, but this one was very boring for me. It felt a lot like she just rehashed the plot from one of her prior ghost stories and just changed the names and added a few extra bits to make it different. It did not have the feeling of an original work at all.... If you are just starting out reading Kurland's work, I'd suggest start with one of the earlier books instead of this one, as it isn't a very good example of her work."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Victoria McKinnon is delighted to get the chance to go to England where she will produce Hamlet in her brother's castle. Moreover, she will get the chance to work with noted actor Michael Fellini. That is just the surface of what will happen to her almost as soon as Victoria arrives. Her brother's castle is haunted by four ghosts, one of whom is not all that pleased to have her there. Connor MacDougal is annoying, grumpy, and a scoundrel; he is also magnficent, and despite obvious barriers, he and Victoria begin to fall in love. However, the only way she can actualize that love is by repeating her brother's daring mission to the past and rescuing her love before he can die, then bringing him forward in time. Of course, the Connor of the past won't remember her, and could think she's a witch. But, if her bone headed brother could do it to get a wife, then surely Victoria can, can't she?***** Lynn Kurland smoothly mingles time travel and ghosts into a story that is sad, fun, and uplifting all at once. This is a pure delight to read. Old friends from her earlier works reappear, but you don't need to have read their stories to enjoy this one. You can catch up while waiting for the next. *****Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"I'm never disappointed in her books! You're in before you've finished the first few pages. No dragging pace here, and they've kept me awake long past bedtime to finish!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Connor MacDougal was definately a grouch and haunting a castle that was not his. But all it took was one look at Victoria and he was lost. it was fun to see the little lady tame the grouchy ghost. Connor is a very endearing ghost!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"It's nice to visit old friends sometimes. It has been awhile since I ventured into the magical worlds of Kurland and I found I still thoroughly enjoy it! She is still way too wordy, somewhat silly but always wonderful fun.The story line in \\"Much Ado...\\" is very much the same as is has been throughout the entire Piaget/MacCloud series with the hero (in this instance Conner MacDougal) and heroine (Victoria MacKinnon) jumping through time on their quest for true love. In previous books, Conner was portrayed as a nasty, rather unlikeable character and Victoria the overly brash and headstrong sister to other main characters. Here, we find them both completely changed, Conner cries and Victoria's insecure. While we understand Victoria's about-face (after all, we all experience those self-doubting moments - even the most determined of us) but Conner's weeping jags just cannot rise to believable if we are to also accept him as a hardened medieval Laird. Aw well, one reads Kurland for the fantasy after all and THAT part never disappoints!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Well as always I love one of her books. I always enjoy reading them and going to England or Scotland. This one had a ton of characters from other novels if this is the first book of Kurlands you have read put it down and go to her web sight and start with the Macleods and then go on to the De Piaget's. But this book was not one of my favorites. It was clean and sweet and had all the good stuff in a Kurland book but the story was already done and just didn't hold my attention like the rest. I also just need to vent a little. I love these books don't get me wrong but there are certain things about Mrs. Kurlands writings I would change if I could.Why does every character blame there digestion for seeing ghost or traveling back in time. Every time they blame the food, it's getting old. The words wooed, wench, whore-son and swoon to name a few are used often and in every book. Every character that has to speak another language catches on so quickly. I can't imagine Gaelic or French is easy to learn. I just wish these are the things I could tell her to try not to repeat in more books. But I will put up with it because I love them.Oh well"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"This book is different from other Lynn Kurland books I read as it almost completely takes place in the present. Victoria McKinnon is the fiance behind a production of Hamlet and come face to face with the ghost of Connor MacDougal an enemy clan who can't believe he has fallen for her. What kind of relationship can the living and the dead have together. The answer presents itself when Victoria's grandma disappears into a time gate and she and Jennifer goes after her to the days of William Shakesphere. Victoria later goes back in time to warn 13th century Connor of the danger of death he'll be in hopes he'll survive and follow her back to the future since his remaining in the past alive would alter the time stream."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Lynn Kurland has once again taken us on a whirlwind journey through time. Once again we find two ill fated lovers who must face the test of time or be fated to never touch the other. And that is the problem with this book. It is a once again novel. I have waited for this book for several years. Once we met Conner and Victoria in MY HEART STOOD STILL, I have looked forward to the book. The book has all of Kurland's usual cast of characters and yet I wished for alittle more, maybe alittle more in the past. Most of this one is in the present. No one does a historical with more humor or elan than Kurland. My personal favorite is still FROM THIS MOMENT ON, Even though it follows a preset path, it is still a very good read. Not as much humor as usual, but still full of fun.Victoria McKinnon is the sister of Thomas McKinnon and runs a playhouse and a troupe of actors who do Shakespeare. Her brother offers Thorpewold Castle as a setting for Hamlet. She is delighted and hurries over to start staging the play. Unfortunately she finds a host of ghosts at the castle one of which she finds most fasinating.Conner is a ghost because his unfaithful wife ran off with a french troubadore. When he is murdered by the minstral he finally settles at Thorpewold Castle. Raging against the loss of his life, he is bad tempered and very loud.When these two very strong minded people meet you expect fireworks but not the kind you get. Both seen to temper their responses to each other and fall madly in love. There are some comic scenes as they dance around each other. When Victoria's granny finds her way into Shakespeare's England, Victoria, Conner and Jennifer, Vicki's sister, must go get her as well as Michael Fellini, the lead actor in her Hamlet.I enjoyed the book and will be watching for the next tale of the McKinnon family. Jennifer still needs to meet her match. I love Kurland's books. I enjoy every chance to read her unique view of romance. Don't miss this book."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"If you read Lynn Kurland regularly, you know that this is what she does best. In her latest, a McKinnon heroine goes to England to produce a play in a castle haunted by the Laird Connor MacDougal a ghost with a past like one of Shakespeare's plays. The intereaction between these two is really enjoyable and while I did not laugh outloud while reading this book, I did smile. Kurland has turned more toward the inner workings of what men think versus what women think instead of the formula writing of most romance novels. (if you are a regular reader you'll recognize alot of these characters from previous work--James McLeod for one.) This is a light read, not the intesity of some of Kurland's work but if you want to be entertained and feel good when you finish reading this is for you. It's not at the top of my Kurland list but I'm not sorry I paid full price for it! And Victoria McKinnon isn't a wimp, which gets tiring in alot of these books by other authors. Buy this one!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"I am a huge Kurland fan. Although her last few books didn't quite hit their mark with me.This one, however, seemed more in line with her older work. It was an entertaining tale. The characters were interesting. I enjoyed the humor in the story. The book was pretty long, maybe a bit longer than need be, but worth reading.I recommend this book. Because Kurland is following along with characters from previous stories, I would recommend you read her books in order. Its more enjoyable to understand the characters that are reintroduced."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"In all honesty, and it's very sadly this book was simply not worthy the average 4 or 5 stars I normally give her works. I've been an avid fan of Lynn Kurland since I first laid my eyes upon, \\"This is all I Ask.\\" Since that novel I had made it a point to read back and collect every book or anthology I had missed. So I know the work she is capable of, and have been very happy with her stories except for perhaps her latest two, now including this one.I liked this book, but that's it, \\"Much Ado In The Moonlight\\" left me a bit cold in the romance department. The magic that her former novels had inspired for me previously just didn't appear to be there, and made it a somewhat difficult novel for me to get through. I didn't quite feel that the split plot engines were needed. I'm also not so certain all of the character cameo was necessary. As much as I enjoy those every now and again!I imagine that to a new reader of her work that this story line might seem quite busy, since there are all these characters springing from here and there. I do feel that with out one reading her earlier novels, a person might lack the knowledge about the cameo characters. And since it's our attachment through their fore stories that which makes the revisit so endearing to us. I just don't think this one stands very well on it's own.If you haven't read any of her earlier novels, I highly suggest them! Please, go out right now and check them out! Then come back and read this one after, the reader may appreciate it more."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Lynn Kurland has been a #1 favorite of mine. I love the fact that she keeps her writing PG rated, but you still get all the lines in between. I have openly laughed while reading her books. (Even during the stares of onlookers that don't understand the magic of storytelling.) Her characters always come to life and I can't wait to visit old friends again, while anxiously awaiting her next release. Although I agree that the characteristics of Conner and Victoria seem to be a little off from what we knew of them in previous stories, I still enjoyed the book. It will join the other re-reads on the bookcase, but not one of my absolute favorites. Definitely pick up any of her books and I know you will be hooked!"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Producer Victoria McKinnon is exhilarated that her wealthy brother Thomas is allowing her to produce Hamlet at his Thorpewold Castle in England. Victoria thinks a genuine old castle adds flavor to the staging of the Shakespearean masterpiece.However, Thomas failed to inform Victoria of a minor problem, Connor MacDougal, the grumpy resident ghost who not only opposes people especially women because he was betrayed by his wife when he was alive eight centuries ago; he also is irate that they plan to butcher the Bard. Victoria is not one to back down from a specter, but is outraged that her sibling failed to warn her. Still on with the show, but instead of causing further trouble, Connor finds himself attracted to Victoria and wants to help her achieve her goal because he finally has met his true love; alas there is a slight problem as she is mortal and he is dead.Few writers if any can merge humor with the supernatural inside a star-crossed romance as well as the incomparable Lynn Kurland can consistently does. If you believe that just try this novel, MUCH ADO IN THE MOONLIGHT, or Ms. Kurland's terrific time travel tales like DREAMS OF STARDUST; you will be a fan after reading any of those. Her latest entry is a terrific paranormal romance starring a crusty creaky ghost and the enthusiastic human female who brings him to life for the first time in his existence. Sub-genre fans will curl around this one sitting treat.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Kurland has added another fun novel with the matchmaking ghosts teaming up with Thomas McKinnon and Iolanthe MacLeod (of My Heart Stood Still) to wed Thomas' sister Victoria to Connor MacDougal, the ghost who has taken over the haunting of Thomas' partially restored castle. Readers of the series will be familiar with many of the characters who appear, but those new to Kurland should at least read Jamie MacLeod's story (A Dance Through Time) and My Heart Stood Still to get a better understanding of the background of Victoria and Connor's romance.Only one thing dissatisfied me with Much Ado in the Moonlight--the almost complete change in characterization of Victoria and Connor from their depiction in My Heart Stood Still. As an English teacher, I understand that writing from a different perspective changes the story, but . . . both Victoria and Connor were completely unlikable before, but now display hearts of gold, hearts that they've been hiding because of traumas in each's past."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"This is the first romance novel that I have read from Lynn Kurland. It seemed to take forever to get going and the first half of the book really dragged on. The last half got much better but there was really no hot sizzling romance to speak of in the story. From the other reviewers, it sounds like her earlier novels were much better so I will try one of those."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"I am a Lynn Kurland fan and she did not disappoint with this book. While it may not be as humourous as some of her others, it is still worth each and every of the 5 stars I've given it. This is the story of Victoria McKinnon and the ghost Connor MacDougal, whom she comes to love and who loves her. The problem of course is that he is a ghost, he died over 800 years ago. But there is a way to restore his mortality by going back in time through a fairy ring and preventing his death. Of course Victoria sacrifices everything to do this because even if she can save him, he may not want to come forward in time to be with her, and even if he did he may not remember her or the love that they shared while he was a ghost.This is a beautifully written love story with great supporting cast. The time travel elements are also well done. The reader has no trouble following the time frames that the author takes you through."},{"Title":"Much Ado In the Moonlight","review":"Really fun, light read! The other reviews do a great job of summarizing the story, but I love the characters in the novel - from grumpy yet handsome Connor, to no-nonsense Victoria, the slimy Michael and the ridiculously funny Granny!

The CD set is not a stand-alone course but instead is the audio-portion of the book-based course. Secondly, a disclaimer: this review is based on the CD set only. I have not read the book. I understand that this is unfair to the course as it was conceived by the authors, but it is fair for the item - CD set- which is sold separately by Amazon and other stores. The course was designed to be either a classroom tool, or a self-study. The quality of audio is good throughout. The instructor is a British woman, who is fast and pressured in her speech. There is about half a dozen native Russian speakers participating in the course. Their pronunciation is a mainstream Russian. Unfortunately, the native speakers do not sound like trained actors, more like random recruits from the street. As a result, the diction is sometimes difficult to understand. A major problem is that words are pronounced only once, quite fast, and pronunciation differs markedly from speaker to speaker. The latter is to be expected in real life, but makes it very difficult for a student to follow. I happen to be a native Russian speaker (I bought the set for my wife) and was surprised to have such a difficulty understanding my compatriots! And that's from Lesson 1! In conclusion, as an intensive in-class course it appears to be adequate. As a self-learning tool - hardly so."},{"Title":"Seventh Day Adventists: What do they believe?","review":"Listing the Adventist church as a cult is a BIG mistake and shows total ignorance of the doctrines of the church and Bible.What's funny is, just because the SDA Church differs with mainline christianity, people like to label them a cult. Jesus was put in the \\"cult leader\\" category when He was here on earth...by the \\"religious\\" MAJORITY.I would like to submit that if Jesus were on earth today, the majority of even professed Christians would not want Him preaching in thier church. He would not be welcome because He would preach all 10 of the commandments just as God gave them originally....and that includes seventh day Sabbath (saturday) worship.The SDA church has only tried to bring people back the the Bible, and what always happens is somebody gets thier toes stepped on because they only want to keep 9 (or less) of the 10 commandments...or they dont want to keep them at all.Fact is, the majority, both christian and non-christian, will never line up with the Bible teachings. The majority always takes the smooth, easy way. Mainline christianity is not following the Bible and points fingers at those who do.If you want to see a cult, you need to look at the largest church in existence because it is also the largest cult in existence. This one should be easy for anyone to figure out.Seventh Day Adventists dont teach anything new, we teach what the church reformers taught...that we need to get back to the Bible and not traditions of men. But christianity at large only wants smooth things.If you want new age teachings then look at \\"Left Behind\\" and the Secret Rapture scenario. This was put out by that \\"cult\\" church described in revelation as the \\"Scarlet Harlot\\"...the \\"Mother\\" church.This was done as the \\"counter\\" reformation, to counteract the damage that was done to that antichrist church of Bible prophecy by those who identified her CORRECTLY as the church of Babylon. And the pitiful thing about this is, Protestants, by and large, are teaching the doctinal heresies of the antichrist while thinking they teach the Bible.If you want to learn truth you need to look elsewhere besides LaHaye, Jenkins, Hal Lindsay and these others who have Left the Truth Behind in thier books and teachings. It's popular but it's not true...it's like a big silly cartoon.Try the books by Steve Wohlberg called Truth Left Behind or Left Behind Deception, or Exploding the Isreal Deception."},{"Title":"Seventh Day Adventists: What do they believe?","review":"Very well written and researched and most useful to anyone wanting to know all about what various cults believe."},{"Title":"Seventh Day Adventists: What do they believe?","review":"If Seventh Day Adventists are a cult then Baptist are a cult, Catholics even more so.Main Entry: cultPronunciation: 'k&lt;Function: nounUsage: often attributiveEtymology: French & Latin; French culte, from Latin cultus care, adoration, from colere to cultivate -- more at WHEEL1 : formal religious veneration : WORSHIP (all churchs fall in this category right?)2 : a system of religious beliefs and ritual; also : its body of adherents (same here)3 : a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also : its body of adherents (Who defines orthodox?

I thought that these books were all about perfection and fantasy and were all the same, but from this book I can tell that isn't the case. These characters were real, like people I know and meet everyday. I especially like the male lead character, Jared. The reluctance he felt to commit, his ambivalence and excuses were not the way I feel a woman fantasizes it should be, but that's the way it all too often is.

They wrote the pathbreaking book,Lesbian/Woman.She wrote in the Preface to this 1976 book, \\"A year ago I knew that wife-beating was a problem in some marriages. But I had no idea of the prevalence of marital violence, nor of its tacit acceptance as a part of life in so many families. Information on the subject was not readily accessible... Working on this book was a consciousness-raising experience for me... 'Battered Wives' includes the collective thoughts and concerns of a great many people.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"The economic and social structure of our present society depends upon the degradation, subjugation, and exploitation of women. Many husbands who batter their wives in anger and frustration are really striking out against a system that entraps them, too.\\" (Pg. xvii)\\"In the traditional Christian marriage ceremony, the minister warns, 'Whom therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder.' These words stand between the battered wife and any help she may seek. No one dares to interfere in the intmiate relationship between husband and wife, even when the husband's violence and the wife's danger are apparent.\\" (Pg. 5)\\"A call to the police is generally an act of desperation in an emergency. By the time the police arrive, however, the wife may be so terror-stricken---so threatened and intimidated by her husband---that she may be unable to articulate the facts about the incident and may even turn the officers away... Doubtless many women have called the police, discovered that they had inadvertently worsened their plight, and chosen to silently endure their violent husband's outbursts from that time forward.\\" (Pg. 77)\\"This kind of anxiety and discomfort (from spending the night with friends) is bad enough for one or two nights, but imagine the prospect of such a makeshift life stretching indefinitely before the woman who has naver been on her own before. Imagine her wondering how she will support herself and her children, especially if she has no work experience.\\" (Pg. 121)\\"So long as the violent man limited his threats to his family, no agency was willing to respond. Once more the door to the family home stood between society and the woman isolated with a dangerous man... presumably the threats the man made on his wife's life didn't count.\\" (Pg. 143)"},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"This is a genuinely original and brilliant book.

It is a collection of experience mostly as a buyer, but also as a dealer, for the short time that she was one.

In discussing her own life experiences and how they relate to her heroin use Marlowe presents heroin use in an uncommon way. Marlowe challenges the definition of using heroin. I expected the book to be about, or at least certainly end with, reasons that people should not use heroin. This is not the case though, Marlowe shows that heroin might not kill you. Heroin might not force you into poverty, it might not make you stop being active and playing sports, and it might not even cause you to lose your job. Marlowe shows that the definition of heroin is not that you will automatically lose your life or have your lifestyle change drastically, but rather that heroin-users lose some of life's richness. Heroin-users miss out on the little things that are often taken for granted. Heroin-users do not experience life's stimulating emotions because they are on emotional auto-pilot. Marlowe states that, &quot;The life heroin bestows is not less painful, just less profound; not less stressful, just less surprsising.&quot; In this book, Marlowe challenges the definition of heroin-users. Marlowe states that doing heroin is not necessarily a death wish, rather, heroin dulls some of life's experiences."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"i don't read books often, b/c they rarely hold my attention. this one is well written, easy to read, & keeps you thinking. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Marlowe is what we opiate addicts refer to as a Burning Man Chipper....someone who cautiously dabbles with the drug and then wears it as a badge of honor. It appears that she ingested just enough heroin over the years to feel some of the paltry effects of first or second time withdrawal. This, apparently, has given her license to expound endlessly on paper about her self-absorbed and very uninteresting life. Reading this book is not unlike attending the first couple of Burning Man festivals a decade ago (white art for white people (I should note that I am white)). If reading idealistically naive and flawed reasoning is what interests you, then skip to the astoundingly moronic \\"Need\\" section.Marlowe's claim to a life of junkie strife is akin to an overweight chain smoker riding a bicycle to the corner store to buy a 5'th of cheap gin and then announcing to the world that she did what Lance Armstrong did with cycling/cancer.I was a heroin addict for 6 years and I spent an additional 2.5 years in amethadone program getting clean.The only way we will beat addiction is through education and accurate information.Marlowe's book is irresponsible and damaging."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Some interesting characters, though I'm afraid she's not one of them. Way too much meandering into her past, her upbringing, her yawn-inducing armchair self-analysis... and as it turns out she never even used a needle, and was more of an occasional trust-fund-endowed snorter.... not that that should disqualify her from writing a book, but I don't think she's quite the authority she tries to pass herself off as. Heroin from A to C, perhaps."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Ann Marlowe is a cleaver writer who has *constructed*, rather than written a not so cleaver book on addiction. Or has she even done that? We see her addiction to the cool, more-hip-than-thou scene of the East Village, certainly a taste for the drug and descriptions of those whose lives were truly ruled by it, but little of her own heart. It may have been more fulfilling if she could have demonstrated how she lost it due to her own disconection, isolation and selfishness of her use, but I suspect she didn't have it in her to begin with.Users can - and do! - recover. One doesn't even need to subscribe to the NA model of addiction to see that. She hints at the end that her realization that life was going on without her, and that desire to be a part of it lead her to stop heroin. While her take on personal responsibility for her use is admirable, her denial of any grip on her life past her use is questionable."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Heroin A - Z is a well written chronical of addiction.

Still this is worth reading."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Well written and absorbing, I read the book in two sittings. The level of pretentiousness increases with the leisure to reflect on the books content. In my favorite passage, Ann reflects on the cruelty of one of the men with whom she has had a relationship. I wondered did he beat her, steal her money, cheat on her. I was flabbergasted when she reveals that he had the temerity to argue with her. As I say, it is a good book and mostly because it caused me to reflect on what sort of person the author appears to be."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"I wholeheartedly support anyone's right to share her experience with heroin. But to act as if your experience with heroin is somehow definitive is quite arrogant and dangerous. Luckily for Marlowe, she managed a fairly recreational heroin habit. Problematically, she judges those who have much more serious habits. Hmmm...Perhaps others are more prone to addiction? She grew up economically priveleged. Should she really be so judgemental?Surprisingly, the book hasn't aged so well -- the prose style is not that compelling, although there are moments of lucidity and intelligence. Yet it is not highly readable."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"How to stop time is a pretty good addition to the annals of addiction lit. Ms. Marlowe conveys a lot of the bright side of narcotics abuse, and doesn't resort to the gritty documentary-verite style so common to the genre. She works in a format (the A-Z list) that makes this a good read, even if you just crack the book open to random pages, and her acute social commentary mostly hits it's mark. Fans of the more gritty heroin journals might be better off seeking the work of Susan Lydon, Scott Frank, or Luke Davies, but for an entertaining read, How To Stop Time is commendable."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"How to Stop Time is truly a lovely book: honest, well-written, funny and merciless. I kept waiting for the veiled inference that those who do heroin on the lower east side are somehow more tortured, more human, more alive than the rest of us, and have to damp down their cutting edge sensibilities with a drug. Thank god Marlowe avoided that trap, and her book is far better than most. Instead, she gives a clear-headed account of herself and her life, with no pretensions and no apologies. She is much bigger than the drug sharing her pages."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Heroin is a selfish drug and its users are boring people. Istill hold that view after reading this book. The more I learn aboutthe notion of being cool, the more I see ordinary people facing their day to day anxieties and overcoming them without resorting to drugs, as heroic, indeed, as super cool. I was keen to read the work as I have two adult children who have been users for over a decade. Although they have led fairly normal lives the financial and emotional costs have been considerable. One has Hepatitis C. As they injected I assume they were more cool than Ann Marlowe. But I was especially interested in the insights by Ms Marlowe regarding relationships - because the user's mind is constantly concerned with how long since they got on, when they're next going to get on, etc, etc they are not &quot;there&quot; with you. They are self-absorbed. I was also interested in the users attitude to money (Heroin habits are denominated in dollars not by mass or frequency), sex, home, glamour, dealers all of which are conveniently covered in alphabetical order. I'm convinced the most effective weapon against heroin is not draconion laws and all out war - which is clearly being lost, just as Prohibition was lost in the USA - but knowledge. Ann Marlowe's book is an intelligent and useful insight into the user's motivation, lifestyle, priorities and experience. It is well written and an absorbing and honest work."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"There's this law in economics called the 80/20 principle, or \\"Pareto's Law\\", named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. The 80/20 principle asserts that a minority of causes, inputs, or effort usually leads to a majority of the results, outputs, or rewards. For example, eighty percent of what you achieve in your job comes from twenty percent of your time spent working. In business, you could say that twenty percent of products usually account for eighty percent of dollar sales value, or twenty percent of customers usually account for eighty percent of profits.It goes on and on: twenty percent of motorists cause eighty percent of accidents, twenty percent of those who marry comprise eighty percent of divorce statistics, and twenty percent of criminals account for eighty percent of all crime. (You can read about this in the book, \\"The 80/20 Principle\\" by Richard Koch.)The 80/20 principle applies to addiction as well. Twenty percent of the people who use drugs account for eighty percent of all problems in our society caused by drug use. So, if I may extrapolate here, I would say that twenty percent of all people who use drugs become addicted. That leaves a lot of people who use drugs who don't become addicts, just as probably eighty percent of people who drink don't become alcoholics.Unfortunately, I'm one of those twenty percenters. If I could blame someone for all my relapses (I can't), I would blame those eighty percenters who seem to be able to use without any damaging consequences. If they can do it, why can't I?Ann Marlowe, who wrote \\"How to Stop Time: Heroin from A to Z\\", is one of those eighty percenters. And for some reason, she decided to write a memoir about addiction. Let me start off by saying she wrote a very interesting and entertaining book. I couldn't put it down...the same way I can't look away from a car crash. But what you've got is, basically, like a social drinker trying to write about what it's like to be an alcoholic. She says that taking heroin is a habit that requires self-discipline. Really? She disputes William Burroughs' characterization of addiction as \\"uncontrollable need.\\" Mr. Burroughs was only, like, the God of junkie-dom. She's even made a confounding case that the the reason junkies use is because they actually want to be addicted. Wow!Marlowe had me laughing out loud at her convoluted, elaborate arguments about the true nature of heroin use and addiction, which reminded me that there are few absolutes in this life. We don't see the world as it really is, we see it as we are.Again, this was a fascinating, if not sometimes exhausting (she sent me to the dictionary a couple of times - valetudinarian?) read. But Marlowe's no expert on addiction and maybe she's not trying to be. Maybe she just pushed my intellectual-inferiority-complex buttons one too many times. After all, she is a Jewish, Ivy league-educated woman from New York City and I'm just a white boy from Alabama biding my time in prison.Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Sometimes grim, sometimes funny, always interesting and well-written, &quot;How To Stop Time&quot; offers an innovative analysis of the psychology and meaning of addiction.

Marlowe wrote the book in many chapters separating her stories while paying no attention to chronological order so that a reader could pick up the book, open it at any page, and begin to read. The many little stories also make for an easy read. Marlowe spends most of the book in denial of the fact that she has an extreme addiction to heroin. She strives to convince her readers that she has total control over the substance. She would like for everyone to think that she is such a strong and disciplined person that she would never let heroin interfere with her success in life, yet the stories she tells proves otherwise. Many of the theories found in her stories somewhat contradict each other, but she does make it quite clear that she has a fear of becoming a \\"junkie.\\" When Marlowe opens her eyes and realizes her dependence on heroin, the physical consequences of the drug, and her slowly deteriorating life, the book comes to an end because she makes the decision to stop trying to stop time.

Time had effectively--it seemed--been stopped. Then there is the matter of the writing; it's been a while since I've read a book this good. It feels that in this day and age, the art of manipulating words on a page to not only tell a good story, but tell it in a manner that holds a person's interest is becoming so outdated, yet Ann does not fall into the trend of blandness. As for the glamorization accusation, Ann addresses the subject quite eloquently herself: &quot;The charge of glamorization comes from those who don't consciously understand why writing about dope makes it seem appealing; it comes from the same impulse that powers all censorship: if your truth isn't ours, shut up.&quot; Does every heroin user have to become a junkie, bottom out, and suffer endlessly for their story to be valid?"},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Marlowe's How to Stop Time is a true story of a heroin abuser. Through reading Marlowe's personal experiences, I began to change many of the stereotypes I had placed on drugs, drug users, and the junkie. Marlowe is extremely truthfull when she tells about the abundance of drugs and heroin being used in New York City. However, I would never believe that a drug abuser like Marlowe could use heroin without any negative side effects. Although Marlowe begins to show side effects when she gets to the letter &quot;p&quot;, she glorifies heroin. She continually frowns upon non-heroin users. At the funeral of her friend, who died of an apparent heroin overdose, she is high. Marlowe says that you can't die from a heroin overdose, those who die mix their drugs. How can this be true?Even though Marlowe shows heroin as a good drug, which I think is wrong, I feel her book to be worthwhile. She not only explores the issues of heroin and drug abuse, but society and childhood as well. How to Stop Time is as socially accurate as any book comes."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"yes! finally a book that shows heroin for what it is: while capable of causing addiction and overdose, if used intelligently in a clean environment the long term detrimental effects are, well, nil."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"For the most part, I liked this book very much. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I have never even touched heroin. Therefore, I give great weight to their comments.I was fascinated to finally read a memoir by an addict who could get up every day, go to work, do some errands, etc.But when I read more of the book, I realized that she could do this, because the author's problem is her need to control. She even tells us that she would experiment with the heroin, as to how often she would get high, as a way to control her heroin intake. It seems that only a very controlling person could keep a job, etc., and be a junkie.In her book she reveals the reasons she needs to control. Perhaps she learned it from her 'perfectionist' father, and/or her mother who compulsively cleaned their kitchen, even though they hired a cleaning lady do this. She touches on this, and as with many extreme behaviors, deep down she couldn't do this constantly; turning to heroin was a relief, a way to 'let go'; the heroin controlled her, and allowed her to finally relax. It also helped her cope with her uneasyness with feelings. But, I wonder, did she ever deal with her real problems? Giving up heroin was only part of her healing. Unfortunately, I don't think she realizes that she has continued some extreme behaviors. She can't have a TV in her house; the only chairs she can have must be wooden folding chairs, etc. She explains that she does this because of her Dad's behavior when he was ill. Yet did she ever grieve for him, or feel true sadness? If she still doesn't allow feelings then she has not healed.On another note, I disagree with the reviewers who commented that that they didn't like the parts of the book which didn't deal with heroin; I feel that many of these other parts actually revealed why she turned to heroin in the first place.I also was rattled by the style of the book, in the beginning, but as I continued to read the book, I didn't even notice it. She is a fine writer, and she also makes some incredibly enlightened statements about our society, especially about consumerism.Overall, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Reading Ann Marlowe's book, How to Stop Time: Heroin from A to Z was a very eye opening experience. This was definently a book that could not be judged by its cover. When first looking at this book, all i saw was a book that would be another &quot;drug story,&quot; another &quot;dont do drugs&quot; book. I could not be more wrong. This book was not a self-pity book. Ann Marlowe proudly tells of her experiences. This is where the term &quot;confusing&quot; comes into play. I was befuddled on whether Ann Marlowe was trying to make people stop doing drugs, or is she trying to condone drugs? The reason for this confusion is because of the way Marlowe lays out the facts of heroin. She does it in a unique way that tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. At least through what she sees. As you continue to read you see how Marlowe's book is one that requires an interactive audience. You can not just absorb what she has written. You have to read, and then analyze, find out what you agree with or not, and then absorb what you want to. This was the part of the book that makes it entertaining. A book that forces you to argue with it will always captivate you."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"This is ohe of the best and most illuminating books there is on drugs.

Cause it's about drugs and shows that with some smarts and income you can hide a habit quite nicely; also Anne is very candid about her experience; which is probably why it's not so good, she comes across as somewhat affected, uber kool, and intelligent, but not particularly pleasant, and you'd image that if you sat next to her at a party, you come away exhausted with Anne having had a sharper point / opinion on everything, which is probably why she took heroin, the hardest drug of the all, you can't beat that.

Believe me, its not that easy for SOME white upper middle class dope fiends...and then the answer is not the other tired cliche which, thankfully, ms marlowe does not delve into (i am talking about narcotics anonymous). anyway, marlowe's cool, distant, elusive prose is very appreciated in the world of \\"druggy lit\\", where hyperbole is a constant. I would have appreciated a bit more of why SHE loved heroin and a little less of how cool all her supermodel junkie friends are, but certain descriptions (such as the titles of the bags of east coast heroin, which is a far cry from the anonymous colored balloons of west coast heroin) were perfect and right on. so, two veins up and four syringes (out of five!)"},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"It may seem incredible, but this book actually gave me the encouragement needed to experiment with the drug.

It's not as she describes. Not at all. It's been a while since I read it, and I must admit, I remember very little about it. Which speaks more to its content than to my memory. Very little humanity, heart, all the good stuff we're looking for in books, art, and life. I actually do feel sorry for the author.

Come to find out she never stuck a needle in her arm. For every one Ann Marlowe there is A thousand heroin addicts who will lead lives of dispare, torture and ultimately death. Opiates are hugely addicting and Her writing reminds me of Vincent Vega (John Travolta's Pulp Fiction Role). We see Vega Shooting up heroin and then cruising down the street with a huge smile on his face. Makes it look quite cool. I cannot tell you the countless lives I have seen ruined by this vicious drug. ANY writing that sheds a positive (Or in Marlowes case, A manageable) light on Heroin use is sad. Simply sad. I pity her."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"I am torn on this book, absolutely torn. Marlowe's writing style is wonderful. She is obviously very intelligent. The problem *I* have here is that what she went through almost doesn't sound real. As in, I am not saying that she made up the fact that she got high. But, as a former heroin addict, I almost think that she either a) is exaggerating how many times she did heroin or b) is lying when she says she hasn't touched it, hasn't even THOUGHT ABOUT IT for years. It just doesn't sound real. And yeah, I know that everyone has a different experience with heroin. But usually not THAT much different. And something that worries me about this book is that it will encourage people to try it. I wish it came with a disclaimer.All that aside, I do think Marlowe's book is a decent piece of literature. Except for the fact that she rambles about things that are completely uninteresting and that have NOTHING to do with stopping time or doing heroin. And some of these anecdotes are really really really boring. Some of them are the kind of stories your grandmother tells you every time she sees you that weren't interesting or funny or lesson-filled the first time but you are forced to sit there and pretend that they are AND not say you've heard them thirty-seven times before.Just an opinion though. I'd leaf through it in the bookstore to make sure you'll like it before you buy it."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"As a rule, I'm not all that interested in &quot;the literature of addiction,&quot; but this book works as memoir, as cultural criticism, as philosophy. Or simply as a story -- of a remarkable woman's struggle with her demons and the demons of post-modern life. The dictionary format (which she seems to have chosen because, like heroin, it &quot;stops time&quot;) doesn't keep you from getting wrapped up in the story. On the contrary -- like the similar device in Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars -- it sets the story in a hall of mirrors, so that the implications stretch endlessly in all directions.My only worry about the book is that Marlowe may be TOO remarkable -- that her obvious energy and strength of character make her an atypical addict, and throw doubt on her generalizations. But she claims that a lot of the other heroin addicts she knew were like her in many ways, and maybe she's right. Besides, I don't suppose de Quincey or Burroughs or Malcolm Lowry were &quot;typical&quot; addicts, either."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"I found &quot;How to Stop Time&quot; compelling. Marlowe's writing style is simple and to the point--a trait I appreciate given too many writers spend too much time filling up space with fluff. As for content, the book wanes somewhat in her commentary on &quot;coping&quot; yet she makes up for it all with her candor and directness. The book is definitely a great read for all who have had to look within themselves and learn to love what they see."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Ann Marlowe is no authority on the subject of heroin, and therefore &quot;how to stop time -- heroin from A to Z&quot; is a complete misnomer as a title. It implies that she has some credibility, and can authoritatively dissect and make sense of aspects of heroin use, abuse, and the heroin users. This book could more aptly be called &quot;my little life -- the heroin years -- from A to Z.&quot; Marlowe states she was never a fully addicted person, admitting to using up to 2 bags on her using days (she took days off), yet she dares to outright dismantle the claims of those that have truly experienced addiction to its depths. She looks down her &quot;Roman&quot; nose at women who neglect children due to serious drug use, or people who are driven by the need to sate their addiction to commit crimes, because she herself has never had to do so. Maybe this is because she was never an addict. With her credentials, her next book could be on auto repair. Afterall, she did have a car, (most likely for longer than her &quot;heroin habit&quot;). She may have even known a mechanic or two. This would certainly put her in the position to make an equally valuable critical analysis on the subject. A self-proclaimed authority on heroin addiction (where did she get the nerve?), Marlowe vascillates between identifying herself with the &quot;junkie,&quot; and distancing herself from them as the pitiful &quot;other.&quot; Her book is confusing, and ultimately disappointing. Anything redeeming about it was underdeveloped -- like her avoidance of clearly answering why she used heroin at all (see &quot;cool,&quot; &quot;hidden,&quot; &quot;fraud&quot; -- oh, that one's not in there.) I am particularly disheartened (read: disgusted) at how she attacks those that have freed themselves from an addiction she cannot even relate to, and then pointedly mocks them on both counts; for being addicted, and for recovering. I was hoping this book would be of some use to me as a researcher of addiction among middle class women, but regrettably, it was more of a disjointed, self-indulgent memoir of a woman who brushed elbows with troubled, talented people, never really revealing herself at all. The title was a real bait and switch. By the end of the book, all I had gleaned was that Ann Marlowe is a Harvard grad, Bergdorf's shopper, name dropper (albeit vague, and what's the point of that?), part time jock, is emotionally frozen, and is a woman who for some totally unclear reason wants to forever align herself in the annals of heroin user history. But she is MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE. Thank God for Ann. She infiltrated the ranks of heroin users, and came back to tell us how hideous they were. Just in case you thought heroin addiction was glamorous. I think this is another case of a fashion victim to the &quot;junkie chic.&quot; (see &quot;inside cover&quot;)"},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Not enough books have been written by financially successful, but not necessarily famous people that use or have used a &quot;bad boy&quot; drug like heroin or crystal methamphetimine. If you're looking for a &quot;how drugs ruined my life and how I was saved by the 'just say no' crusade&quot; or some such mumbo jumbo, do not read this book because you will be very disappointed. The author documents various periods from her life before, during, and after heroin, but not necessarily in that order. As a professional woman with a similar background as the author and an IV meth user myself, it was very refreshing to not encounter what I refer to as a &quot;victum&quot; mentality style of writing. What I mean is the author does not make excuses like &quot;I had a bad childhood&quot; or &quot;I couldn't help myself, I was an addict,&quot; which is the bandwaagon trend in American society's portrayal of any illicit drug user these days. Instead, Marlowe describes her relationship with heroin as a choice, with no appologies, at different stages of her life, and throughout various circumstances. She includes her relationship with heroin and herself, heroin, her friends and herself, heroin, her lovers, and herself, as well as the heroin, career, and family triangles. Marlowe portrays a much more realistic view of the ups and downs of a middle class, daily user and entertains in the process, which is something Hollywood and mainstream American media rarely, if ever accomplish. Good read."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"ive read this book, but more importantly lived this craziness and will attest to the accuracy of her observations. as i read some of the passages i could actually taste the taste and started to sniffle,my nose began to run. it scared the hell out of me. i wish i could say that life style was behind me,but anyone who has done heroin will admit you never stop wanting it,that you sometimes still dream about it,and know intimately the situations you put yourself in. Jim Michaels"},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be. Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others. I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination). What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world. Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull. I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent. But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did). She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her \\"coolness\\" factor. Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either. If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy. If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Many people can take Ann Marlowe's book, How to Stop Time, in many ways. It could be seen as a ruthless, crude journal of a heroin user or a story of a women that just wants to share her experiences with her audience. How to Stop Time is a beautifully written story that can capture anyone's attention. It is an extremely personal account of her survival in the dope world. She is honest, blunt, and straightforward about everything so we get a very good look at what she went through. The many disturbing parts of the book only make the story more real and true. The things that she attempts to explain about the crazy life of a drug addict is something that the media will never uncover. Her style of writing is simple and to the point and her explanation of self destruction is something that every reader can relate to on some level. She not only discusses the life of heroin use but she dwells into much deeper topics such as the economics and psychology of the addiction. She clearly shows that she isn't afraid to tell the truth which provides for an extremely compelling and daring analysis."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"How to Stop Time was a good read. It was one of those books, that you would be assigned to read in a Rhetoric class, and you keep reading over the assigned pages, because it is so interesting. It is especially interesting to someone who has never done heroin. Ann Marlowe does not glorify nor does she speak down upon the drug. It may seem as though she does both, but she is just telling of a personal experience she has had.This is not a book that I would read again, I only like to read books once, if I did read books more than once, this would be one of them."},{"Title":"How To Stop Time: Heroin From a To Z","review":"Small wonder that the NYTimes praised this little tome- it's an elitist valentine to the city and hipster culture that spawned its own elitist ennui. Marlowe writes decent prose, but her pinned-pupil navelgazing gets taxing real quick, as does the irritatingly unfocused pseudo-philosophy that comprises around a third of the book. Marlowe seems like the sort of person you'd try desperately to avoid at a cocktail party (or in a cop spot, for that matter): a narcissistic, world-weary poseur, witlessly droning on about her Harvard education and her uber-hip (but ill-defined) underground ties, and wearing her psychic track marks like a badge of worth. Yes, it is formatted unusually, and there are some surprises within the little anecdotes that make up the dictionary entries. It's also an atypical way to approach addiction - from within, from a thoroughly middle-class standpoint - and Marlowe even raises a couple interesting points about the nature of habit and need. But the whole exercise feels hollow; one gets the feeling that she started doing heroin because she _wanted_ to become addicted, not for the warmth and the rush and the urgency of the high, not for the transcendence and vision of the ruined ecstatic junkie, but because she just didn't have anything else to write about. Perhaps next we'll see a book structured as a thesaurus about her harrowing caffeine addiction. Count me out of the bloodless solipsism displayed here; I'll take Denis Johnson's groping, fallen desperates (or, in a more closely related vein, D.F. Wallace's hyper-eloquent and witty recovering addicts) over Marlowe's well-dressed neurotics."},{"Title":"The Solarians","review":"fast and just as described. reading the solarians brings back a lot of memories I really enjoyed it as much as I did when younger."},{"Title":"The Solarians","review":"Norman Spinrad is one of the long-term masters of science fiction, and this was his very ambitious debut novel from 1966. Here we see big ideas already developing, but Spinrad's ambition was unfocused, and this book creaks under its own weight. The story gets off to a pretty lousy start, in the middle of an over-described but under-conceived space battle with faceless alien enemies called the Duglaari. Spinrad tries to instill real science into his fiction, but accomplishes little more than made-up terms like \\"lasecannon\\" or \\"smell-organ.\\" However, the middle of the novel gets more interesting, as Spinrad drops the pretensions of military sci-fi for pretty intriguing human speculation. We learn that in this distant future, humans have spread throughout the galaxy but are being slowly exterminated by the Duglaari, an alien race that are wonderfully and creatively inhuman. The bizarre society of the Duglaari is probably the most eye-popping aspect of this book. Meanwhile, the people who stayed behind on Earth isolated themselves from their fellow humans, and evolved into a new society called the Solarians, with all human potential realized. The Solarians have now reemerged with a humanistic plan to defeat the coldly logical Duglaari.These are all bodacious concepts for a debut novel by a young writer, and Spinrad offered some pretty strong philosophy on the nature of humanity and man's potential, while exploring the differences between the righteous Solarians and the directionless humans of the rest of the galaxy. But this is where the ambition of the novel started to become a liability. There are many holes in Spinrad's conception of the Solarians, especially in the short amount of time in which they've evolved, and the implausibly of the social upheavals that got them to this point. Then the end of the novel degenerates into increasingly ridiculous political and military machinations, which get more and more hyperbolic and sensationalistic. We are rewarded with an avalanche of over-enthusiastic big thoughts on humanity's future, which are the thinnest possible result of Spinrad's earlier philosophical explorations. In the end, you can appreciate the ambitious big ideas of this novel, but you can only hope that Spinrad would develop more focus and conciseness as he went forward. And he did.

He's not well known but this early effort is a wonderful read. He anticipates many advances we now take for granted. I bought an original paperwork in a half-price bookstore the other day and am flying through this sci fi adventure space opera story about a future battle with against the alien Doogs. Wish Hollywood would read this stuff and make movies out of it rather than crap like Riddick and 5th Element, or Star Wars for that matter."},{"Title":"The Solarians","review":"Life has been going along happily for most people.

A cultural biography; the context of the life Joseph Smith jr. comes into focus. Rough Stone Rolling is a truly rewarding read for anyone trying to understand the peculiarity of Mormonism. While providing a rich tapestry of characters that influenced or where influenced by Joseph Smith jr. the book also carries a narrative on many subjects such as the problems of Mormon \\"block vote\\", (reverberating still today), 19th century \\"culture of honour\\", democracy versus theocracy, abolitionism etc. The book is engrossing from the first page to the last! Richard L. Bushman is a model author: soft-spoken, intelligent, empathic, and most importantly, ever striving for honesty. As in real life I often found myself sympathising and understanding both Joseph Smith and his opponents. Joseph Smith is a troubling figure, but also a visionary man of unusual and remarkable achievements. The best way to know him may still be \\"by his works\\", but this book in my opinion is a highly qualified second best! I'd love to read it again."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I thought this book was fascinating. I was familiar with most of the events he discussed, but the detail and scholarship Bushman brings to all of this added much more understanding. His explanations of things that we find questionable or controversial today also make a lot of sense in the context of who Jospeh was and the circumstances in which he made. I recommedn this to anybody who seeks more understanding of Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I am not a Mormon but I am a direct descendent of Alexander Niebaur, who joined the Mormon community in Nauvoo. When I began to read Bushman's book, I knew I would be comparing it to Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History,\\" and Donna Hill's \\"Joseph Smith, the First Mormon.\\"First comparison: How easy is this book to read? Fawn Brodie possessed awsome writing skills and I would have to put her book first. Donna Hill is also a skillful writer, so I put her second. Bushman is much more professorial, plus I think he labored under an unfair burden: His was the long-awaited final word on Joseph Smith by a faithful Mormon. A heavy burden, but I think he carried it well.Second: How well researched is this book? Brodie wrote generations ago and some new research has come to light. But she was the first one to look without flinching. The courage to operate out of her research is breathtaking. One reason she was so controversial was this: She revealed the prophet as a very flawed human being who could be pretentious, arrogant, and dishonest. The Mormon faithful attacked Brodie, but Mormon apologists finally admitted Brodie was not making the tough stuff up. Writing later, Hill had an advantage. Even though she is a practicing Mormon who might have regretted some of Smith's actions, she was under no obligation to disprove what the historical record shows. But she also had a disadvantage. When Brodie was doing her research, she had free access to all kinds of information. After her book, official LDS libraries suddenly became less accessable to research historians. Bushman, writing even later, maybe had the credentials with high church authority to allow him to get access to materials not seen by Hill.Third: Are the authors honest? Brodie stirred up a hornet's nest--first by rejecting Smith's claims and leaving the church and, second, by offering psychological explanations for much of Smith's behavior. Hill and Bushman are devout Mormons and they take Smith at his word. He is a true prophet. Does that make them historically more correct than Brodie? I have a friend who is a psychologist who read Hill's book and told me Smith reminded him of bi-polar patients he had treated. Is Brodie less reliable because she concluded that he was somewhat insane? As Mormons themselves say, he was either lying, insane, or telling the truth. Mormons themselves say examine the evidence and make your own conclusion.Fourth: Which book strikes me as most honest? Unless there is a library of first hand Joseph Smith information hidden somewhere, we know about all there is to know about the Prophet. Previous to Brodie, books about Smith were hagiographies, pious stories that ignored anything negative. And so Brodie broke the mold, laying out the story in the hard-nosed way of a real scholar. Hill and Bushman try to be scholars, but they both write from a position of faith. It is fascinating to know a lot of the facts, and then see what the three authors did with those facts.Fifth: Which book would I recommend? Brodie set the terms of the discussion and many of her words and phrases reappear in both Hill and Bushman. I would call her a must read. Hill would be a good read for any Mormon or non-Mormon. She takes on a lot of the tough stuff and does her best with it; she presents a human and believable portrait of the prophet. One thing I like about Bushman is this: He gives a good summary of the step-by step development of the Mormon hierarachy. (In his book \\"The Rise of Mormon Authority,\\" D. Michael Quinn does a challenging study of the same issue). Another plus in Bushman's book: he gives a really good summary of Smith's justifications for polygamy and its theological significance in Mormon expectations for the afterlife. But compared with Hill and Brodie, his summary of the last three years of Smith's life seems a bit abrupt. And a person would have to read Newell and Avery's very readable \\"Mormon Enigma\\" to get a thorough look at polygamy. Their book is even more interesting because it is written from the perspective of Emma Smith, the prophet's first wife."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I am no Saint (by which I mean Latter Day), but I found this book to be fascinating & beautifully written. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Saint, so I think it holds truth for both sides. I was shocked at how little of what I had in my head about Joseph Smith was true, & enthralled with his real life story & the story of his church. I appreciated that Bushman is a Saint but he is also able to explain things very well in an academic, not purely faithful, manner (& he hasn't gotten excommunicated either!). I am ashamed that we as Americans murdered Joseph Smith, man or prophet (or both), & drove the rest of the faithful out of the country (& did you know that when we wanted them back, Utah would only join the union if their women kept -- not gained, but kept -- their vote?). One cannot be interested in American history or the settling of the West without being curious about the LDS Church. No, I'm not pleased that the Church recently voted in measure 8, but after reading this book I can see that the fear & misconceptions that surrounded Joseph in his life are still with us today. Even if you are not a Saint, if you are a lover of truth, I highly recommend that try this book!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Bushman's historical analysis of Joseph Smith gives an excellent view into the life of Joseph Smith and the birth of the LDS church. Bushman is himself a Mormon, but he covers the ground of both critics and apologists in an objective way (so objective that the partisans may find it objectionable). Besides covering the transformation Joseph Smith from farmboy to prophet, the development of Mormon doctrine is placed in context with culture, religions, and attitudes of the time. Although the book is certainly a scholarly work and is extensively referenced, it is very easy and entertaining to read"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As a long time American History buff I was struck by the arc Bushman presents. Jos. Smith was most decidedly not perfect. If this Joseph is saveable, then the rest of us have a chance. Hat's off to Bushman for not side-stepping polyandry, polygamy, deception of Emma, character assasination of associates, and many other \\"thickets\\" in which the image of Joseph is caught.The Smith of Bushman's masterful pen (keystrokes?) emerges as a resilient defier of description. In the end, all we really know is that he pulled off an unequaled, herculean feat, and along the way left a trail of condundrums. At the very least Bushmans' Smith learned what Rembrandt knew - , \\"Do what you know and what you don't know becomes revealed.\\" (paraphrasing)Bushman takes us into the mind of a \\"doing\\" Smith whose vision expanded over and over again. When he thought himself finished with his mission, a flood of \\"revelations\\" would fill the vacuum, and off he'd be, unfolding a new and different emphasis for God's people. Then again, he'd declare his work for God finished, and again a flood of knowledge would fill his being. This cycle repeats over and over, and creates a fascinating character arc, as Bushman seeks to show us how Joseph thought about this process himself. Joseph did what he knew was to be done, and then more was revealed. The artist and the prophet know what it takes to get new knowledge...one must recognize the divine as it comes to the soul and then act on it, damn the conseqences. This takes practice, and failure many times. Bushman leaves us not surprised at the failures. For a plow boy to become a nation builder/prophet of God, the plowboy must be a Man-O-Action, an indefatigable optimist. Bushman makes this abundantly clear for Joseph Smith. The title \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" is apt.Bushman protrays the restless motivator, the endless innovator, the defier of convention, the synthesizer of civilizations, the deceptive husband, the flawed judge of character, the loyal defender of friends, a frontier firebrand, the forgiver, the virtiolic protestor, the militant, the passifier. Whew!!The culmination was that Smith's actions created a trajectory towards inevitable calamity. Bushman explores how Joseph thought about the the fusion of theorcracy with democracy, Abrahamic marriage and monogamy, Kabbalah and Masonry, Politics and Prophecy, nation building and family knitting, ongoing revelation and canonized dogma, anti-creed yet ritualized religion making. In all these Bushman treats the paradoxes with a quizzical yet respectful awe. I appreciated his willingness to say \\"we don't know why\\" when we truly don't why Joseph put himself in almost inextricable positions. So much of it is tragic.After all is said, Bushmans' Smith is a very human force of nature/God which this reader finds unnerving and inspiring. Unnerving because I understand how the Corrills, Cowderys and Pratts would leave him; militancy, anger, steamrolling friends at the appearance of disloyalty, alpha-male swaggering, short term prophecy failure, subterfuge in marriage, and disregard for others boundaries. Inspired because he continued to shake his opponents off his heals until he left a legacy which trancended his weaknesses and moved millions, which is what he wanted, which is what he \\"prophesied\\".With all his imperfections and inspirations intact, he \\"did what he knew\\" and finally that was all he could do.Bushman make all this lucid with reserved, precise prose, tempered by the enormity of fitting this subject into one 600 page book. Given the outsized images previous biographers have offered, Bushman has crafted a superbly balanced treatment of an intimidating subject. Three Cheers!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Richard Lyman Bushman (born 1931) is an American historian and Professor of History emeritus at Columbia University, and Visiting Professor in Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University. He is himself a practicing Latter-day Saint.He writes in the Preface to this 2005 book, \\"it is unlikely there will ever be consensus on Joseph Smith's character or his achievements... A believing historian like myself cannot hope to rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible.

Truth is stronger than fiction... my testimony has been strengthened."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"After reading this book, I feel like I know this largely enigmatic figure in American history, and I am inspired by what I know. This is a very well written objective biography of the raw history of Joseph Smith. Richard Bushman goes to great lengths to voice and quote opposing points of view on the life of this \\"American Prophet\\" to bring out the totality of the man. There are many facts brought out at which believers at times would be thrilled, yet at other times can be dismayed. The critic would probably also have similar emotions, brushing aside the inspirational, and highlighting those things that promote their side. A complete reading is necessary, as often the given facts seem to tell one side of the story, until further reading gives us a more complete understanding.After his first vision, Joseph Smith was only changed in knowledge, not in person. He was still the same unschooled, back woods old American boy. He walked and talked the same. It is thrilling to be with him as we are shown a hot-tempered, yet passionate boy with only a third-grade education as he is molded into a very powerful leader that could stir the soul of the most intelligent well-schooled people America had to offer. He was a simple man, not unlike most in his day. He grew and learned the same as any man, yet there was something about him that would cause many to be willing to give up their very lives for the cause he represented.I have to wonder what the biography of some of the Biblical prophets would look like if we had them. Would we find perfect men, or imperfect men striving to do their best in an imperfect world? I tend to think the latter. Certainly their rubbing shoulders with God would enlighten their understanding and their actions would eventually follow. But, in fact we do find that Noah was a drunkard, Paul sought out Christians for persecution and death, Jonah ran from his task, and Moses killed an Egyptian taskmaster, just to name a few. These are only things we know of them that are in scripture. Not to discredit these men of God, but it certainly seems to be the pattern that God chooses imperfect men to spread His perfect message. They would learn obedience and a more holy way of life the same as any of their followers would.The \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" in the title is from the mouth of Joseph Smith as he described himself as a rough stone rolling down a hill as the rough spots are broken one at a time by severe blows, until it finally becomes a polished stone. At just 14 Joseph prophesied his name would be known for good and evil in the entire world. This certainly seems to be the case today. He translated a new book of scripture, restored a religion, Temples and priesthood, built new cities, headed governments and armies, and brought to light a massive amount of new thought, all at a fairly young age. \\"Whom shall he teach knowledge? And whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts\\" (Isaiah 28:9).

After reading this book, I feel like I know the Prophet. I am thankful for his courage and for his bringing about the Church of Jesus Christ and everything that goes with it. As for those who don't find this book inspiring...maybe we didn't read the same book. I found it completely inspirational and satisfying. A question I have for the scholar who disapproves of the book: Is this an error filled book? It seemed pretty well sourced. I am no scholar, but what I do know is this: It's good to know that such a magnificent work was brought about by a regular person, albeit a person chosen of god. What's wrong with admitting faults and weaknesses? We all have them; the key is knowing who you are, striving to do what's right, and having faith in the Saviour to make up the difference."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I am not going to attempt an in-depth review of this excellent book. Suffice to say that I feel this work to be the most informative and insightful biography on Joseph Smith and the founding of Mormonism that I have read: and I have read well over half a dozen major works on Joseph Smith, including all of his published writings. Bushman has covered the lot: the nature of revelations claimed by Joseph Smith; his growing vision as a religion maker; his weaknesses and mistakes; and his final moves that resulted in his death. The focus on the cultural setting is invaluable, in my opinion, in placing Joseph Smith in his world. Mormons back then were not very much like Mormons today in many fundamental ways. The successful emergence of Mormonism was as much a matter of timing and location as it was the work of Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is a masterpiece of the life and contributions of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. Though Richard Bushman himself is LDS, he does not hold back. He is fortright in his analysis and interpretation. As Smith was told that his name would be had for good and evil thoroughout the world, one could argue that the LDS church and some historians share the same fate. One cannot read this tremendous biography and not think that Joseph Smith was one of the great characters of American history and that his vision of religion and God has not had serious impact in history and religion. Bushman paints a portrait with fine strokes of brilliance; even Smith's warts shine and glimmer. The research is impeccable and prose profound."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I am LDS (Mormon), but that doesn't mean I like spending $40 on a book at some overpriced Utah-culture bookstore--I love Amazon for books! I bought it for my husband as an anniversary gift, since he loves the culture and history surrounding the upheaval of Smith's life and his church that he established. It's fascinating. If you want a historically accurate, mostly objective book on Joseph Smith, this is your book. Most books written about Smith are from rose-colored eyes of devout LDS writers, who tend to paint him as a perfect saint, or from rabid anti-mormon writers, who tend to potray him as a devil. He was neither; he was a just a man, a good man.As always with Amazon, my purchase was received on time, even early, and in perfectly new condition, still wrapped, as promised."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I believe this book is an excellent read for anyone interested in a fair, factual presentation of Joseph Smith and the early Mormon Church. The author is fair in presenting both the good and bad regarding one of the very influential American religious leaders. I would encourage both Mormons and non-Mormons to read this book. Mormons will find much that they are not taught in Sunday School and, yet, their faith might be strengthened, if they realize that Joseph Smith was a human with many faults. Those not belonging to the Mormon Church will learn much about the early years of our country and rather strange things about the early, formative Mormon Church."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book is by far the best work that I have read about the man, Joseph Smith.

This book does not, it points out all of his weaknesses and strengths at the same time. Often showing faults and foibles never mentioned in most other literature. Although some will speak as that being a form of blasphemy against the church, I did not find it so. I actually found it rather strengthened my testimony of Joseph Smith.Joseph Smith was subject to the trials, hardships, and mistakes, just like all of the rest of us. He did not live a perfect life. I found it refreshing to see his mistakes because it actually gives me hope. I am not perfect, nor will I ever be in this life.

This is probably the best biography so far, but may not be the last word.Magic, by a common definition, is the ability to create change in accordance with the will. In Christianity there is a definite connection between magic and worship. For instance, most prayer begins with \\"worship\\" (which means to \\"bend the knee\\" - in other words, to show respect to a higher power) and ends with a request for something (magic).Josephs' interest in magic does not bother me at all because magic is an important part of the religious experience.Also, what is so strange about searching for buried treasure? A lot of kids do that. I can remember my childhood excitement in finding a hidden cave (no treasure though).I always thought that Joseph translated the Book of Mormon using available \\"tools\\" - other books, other better educated people, plus a gift of inspired intuition. What amazed me is Bushmans' case that Joseph basically wrote down words that he saw appearing in special stones. Yet it makes sense, tying in with Jewish tradition about how the High Priest received revelation.Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is the book I have been looking for: a thoroughly researched and documented account of Joseph Smith's life and times, viewed through the eyes of an historian more interested in Smith's OWN thoughts and worldview than what was said ABOUT him.Joseph Smith saw himself as the prophet the Lord chose to fully restore His church in the world's latter-days. By couching this history in terms of Smith's self-perception, bright and illuminating light is thrown on the motivation for the things he said and did. Framing this account in terms of the culture of the early 1800's further clarifies Joseph's words and actions, as he struggled with the seemingly overwhelming responsibilities he shouldered as a prophet of the Lord.Some readers will wonder how Joseph Smith could be a prophet, if he was less then perfect. They must keep in mind that (aside from Christ), God has never chosen men (or women) because they were perfect- which they most certainly are not. He chooses them because of their righteous desires to serve him, and because of the gifts they bring to the Work.Reading about Joseph Smith's struggles, successes and failures only makes me realize even more how great of a man he was, and why God chose him above all others.I would recommend to readers unfamiliar with Joseph Smith to also read the Book of Mormon in order to comprehend its lasting and eternal impact on the world."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As fate would have it, I began reading this book only a week after Marlin K. Jensen, an LDS General Authority of two decades and the current Church Historian, visited our stake (Durham, NC). During the adult session of stake conference, Elder Jensen said that he is often asked how he can have so much faith given what he knows about the \\"problems\\" in Church history. While he didn't explicitly cite Alexander Pope's dictum that \\"a little learning is a dangerous thing,\\" it was certainly the spirit of the counsel that he imparted. \\"Church history,\\" he said, is a \\"big jigsaw puzzle. If you want to put it together, start with the borders. And don't study a little...study a lot.\\"As I read Rough Stone Rolling, I found myself repeatedly reflecting on Jensen's puzzle metaphor. Richard Bushman has masterfully performed the Herculean task of accumulating and assembling the anecdotes, conversations, and, most importantly, doctrines of the most preeminent (and controversial) figure in America's religious history to create a wonderfully lucid biography. As Joseph famously said in the King Follett sermon, \\"no man knows my history.\\" We cannot perfectly know the mind of the Prophet, but Bushman's trenchant observations provide us with a clearer picture than any other historian or commentator has to date.Bushman's prophet is not the virtual superman depicted by Truman G. Madsen in his celebrated \\"Joseph Smith lectures\\" delivered at BYU's Marriott Center three decades ago. Madsen catalogued Joseph's laudable traits without devoting much time to exploring their origins or considering his deficiencies. Bushman's approach is more nuanced, showing us an imperfect, yet great, man whose character was largely shaped by the culture of his time, revelations he received, and trials he endured.If there were any extraordinary aspects to Joseph's personality, they were not readily manifest to those who knew him during his teenage years in Palmyra, New York in the 1820s. An unassuming boy, his most salient attributes were a love of his family and an earnest desire to know the path of salvation. Clearly, a naturally ambitious disposition did not provide the indefatigable zeal for gathering saints, preaching of Zion, and constructing temples. Rather, Joseph was impelled by the restorationist theology that he would begin developing ten years after his First Vision in 1820.Rough Stone presents Joseph Smith's two major flaws: an occasional temper when his authority was challenged (an attribute shared by George Washington) and a penchant for placing unwarranted levels of trust in other people. According to Bushman, both traits can be readily understood.To the first, Joseph was a product of early 19th century America, where a man's most valued asset was his honor (particularly amongst less affluent frontiersmen). As George Washington struggled to build and maintain a fragile Continental Army despite fearsome opposition, so Joseph labored to build Zion in the face of considerable editorial and political antagonism. In both military and ecclesiastical endeavors, a modicum of dissension could quickly metastasize into a death sentence for the organization.If Joseph was quick to squelch apostasy, he was even faster to welcome disaffected members back into the flock. Case in point: In late 1838, William W. Phelps (publisher of Joseph's revelations) was one of several men who bore witness against Smith and other leaders, enabling their hellish imprisonment in Liberty, Missouri for four months. In June 1840, a contrite Phelps pled for forgiveness. Joseph replied with an offer of full fellowship, ending his letter, \\"Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, For friends at first are friends again at last\\" (Bushman doesn't cite the couplet, but I've always been moved by it).Regarding his (ostensibly) deficient capacity to judge character, Bushman points out that extenuating circumstances may have forced (or at least encouraged) Joseph's hand. As a nascent movement on the American frontier, the early Church was often starved for experienced men to fill leadership posts. Accordingly, sophisticates like John C. Bennett quickly found themselves in Joseph's inner circle shortly after baptism, despite the shallow roots of their faith. (Although he later became a vociferous anti-Mormon, Bennett's ability to secure a liberal city charter for Nauvoo, Illinois proved instrumental in preserving Joseph's life, as the Prophet relied on municipal writs of habeas corpus to save him from extradition to Missouri, where he would have surely been killed.)As the Phelps and Bennett cases illustrate, Joseph had a strong inclination to see the good in people, whether they were new converts or non-Mormon public officials to whom he appealed for redress regarding Missouri persecutions. Mankind's divine potential- the doctrine that would come to permeate the Prophet's theology- likely fostered an overly optimistic spirit that Joseph carried over into the day-to-day matters of establishing Zion, although he would have often been better served by a more skeptical approach (the Kirtland Bank comes foremost to mind).Much more than elucidating Joseph's character, Bushman paints a coherent history of LDS doctrine and church organization, adroitly chronicling all events within a 19th century frontier context (the importance of which can hardly be understated when we would otherwise clumsily attempt to understand them through a 21st-century lens).Whatever else Rough Stone readers are tempted to conclude, they cannot honestly impugn Joseph's sincerity. The hallmark of a charlatan is not an eagerness to admit new acquaintances into his inner sanctum and quickly entrust them with a large amount of responsibility. How many deceivers' first recorded revelation would be a stiff, personal repudiation from the Lord? (Doctrine and Covenants Section Three, wherein Joseph is reproved for loss of 116 manuscript pages from the Book of Lehi) What sort of scriptural con artist would confess to his scribe that his gift of translation had been compromised after a quarrel with his wife and retuned only after he begged her forgiveness?170 years after the Prophet began to privately teach it, plural marriage remains the third rail of LDS doctrine. While the introduction of the Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith lesson manual (published in 2007) discloses that Brother Joseph taught plural marriage, it only states that the manual doesn't discuss the practice, and that it was officially discontinued in 1890. Given the delicate nature of the subject, avoidance is probably the best policy in most Sunday meetings. Bushman, however, has no compunction about giving his readers a thorough review of the matter.Of all of his teachings, Joseph's plural marriage was undoubtedly the most polarizing. Regrettably, the secrecy of the practice, and the distortion and abuse thereof by Bennett and other Nauvoo Mormons, greatly clouds the picture. The knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss Joseph as a licentious fraud, but the nuances of the situation force a serious reconsideration. Beyond the fact that Joseph usually sought the approval of parents (or other close relatives) before a proposition, we should ask what kind of seduction artist also encourages his prey to seek confirmation from the Lord before acceding to a marriage proposal. Bushman cites numerous examples of women who initially bristled at the propositions, yet subsequently received profound spiritual manifestations that convinced them to engage in the practice.Not only did plural marriage precipitate apostasy in Nauvoo, it greatly strained Joseph's relationship with his first wife, Emma, and ultimately cost him his life. One wonders if Christ may have had the same divisive principle in mind when he told his apostles, \\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\\"Even absent his more difficult doctrines, Joseph Smith was destined to be a polarizing figure. At best, he is a prophet and religious genius. At worst, he is a self-deluded, albeit earnest, visionary. Either way, Joseph never intended Mormonism to be a means for his own aggrandizement. Rather, the Church was a conduit for the pure in heart to realize a profound destiny. Indeed, Joseph's First Vision and angelic visitations were not even included in early missionary tracts; the crux of the proselytizing message lay in the restoration of priesthood authority and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.If nihilism has one antithesis, it is Joseph Smith's theology. At the most fundamental level, the Church's appeal is this: of all of the world's religions and philosophies, Mormonism arguably provides the most meaningful narrative for mortal existence. In nearly every action -however seemingly pedestrian- Joseph saw eternal significance. A mother bearing a child was providing a mortal body for a spirit, thereby enabling it to eventually receive \\"a fullness of joy.\\" Records kept for proxy baptisms for the dead would one day be among the books referenced at the last judgment, as seen by John the Revelator. Most significantly, Joseph Smith reiterated the biblical promises of Paul and John in no uncertain terms: the faithful would eventually be exalted to become kings and priests- even gods- in their own right.Although Rough Stone Rolling is a biography par excellence, Joseph Smith can't be comprehended by reading Bushman's oeuvre any more than the realities of war can be appreciated by viewing Saving Private Ryan in the comfort of one's living room. Our best hope for understanding the Prophet is by making a concerted effort to embrace his doctrines.If there is one overarching lesson for Church members to glean from this superb history, it's that Mormonism isn't about lionizing Joseph Smith or any other church leader. Rather, the LDS faith is about learning, pondering, and ultimately, living the sublime principles that the Prophet imparted during his remarkable sojourn on earth.Thanks, Brother Bushman, for your masterful work."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As the author of the LDS-oriented bookBuilding Wealth for Building the Kingdom: A Financial Planning Guide for Latter-day Saint Families, I found Bushman's biography of Joseph Smith to be academically rigorous and remarkably unbiased.Bushman is an active member and leader of the LDS Church so it is remarkable that some Latter-day Saints have been critical of the book for being critical of the Prophet. The book is not critical of the prophet, it is remarkably objective. It is not intended to be a collection of faith promoting stories about the prophet; it is intended to be--and I believe it achieves this objective--the definitive biography of Joseph Smith.The book is written by an academic and it has an academic tone, not the reverent tone that is typical of the way Latter-day Saints discuss the \\"prophet of the restoration.\\" Without the reverent language, readers are free to think objectively about the history of Joseph Smith and form their own opinions based on his peculiarly well documented life. On many of the most controversial claims in Joseph Smith's history, Bushman takes a balanced view, looking at evidence from both sides and making a an academic analysis of available records. He never relies on his faith to lead him to a conclusion, instead following the records.All Latter-day Saints would benefit from a thoughtful reading of the book. It is a weighty tome that takes more than a few evenings to read. Thoughtfully reading the book will tend to inoculate faithful readers from critics of the Church who would attempt to use biased versions of Joseph Smith's history to cause members to lose their faith.Anyone who appreciates a good biography or has an interest in American history would also find this book fascinating. Despite being written by a faithful Latter-day Saint, the author is a bona fide academic and it is written with objectivity to help anyone to better understand the story of the foundation of what has been described as the consummate American religion."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"What would your contemporaries say about you? Would what your friends say about you be different than what your family thinks about you? How would those who \`don't like you' describe you differently from those who do like you? What might historians write about you, your motivations, and your life in 150+ years after you are dead?This book puts the character of 'the man', Joseph Smith, in the context of his contemporaries. It looks at 'the man', Joseph Smith, through the eyes of the other \\"trees in the forest\\" of his time. It analyzes the critics somewhat, too. Done with a reasonable attempt at objectivity it makes Joseph Smith appear at times 'real and rational' and at times 'wholly illogical' as a person. It attempts to consider \`cause and effect' in context from writings of other thinkers of the 19th century. At other times Bushman presupposes to know the motivations or rationale for Joseph Smith's (or for his critic's) actions from some publications possibly available--without demonstrating that they were in fact read by the individuals before choosing to decide and to take action.It seems that frequently Bushman assumes that someone raised in a word-of-mouth 19th century world would 'think like' and have the 'current resources' at his disposal which a college professor with a Phd. might have at his fingertips in today's world of free internet access to contemporary writings.Still, in today's world of political correctness, this is a frank and candid look at what 'the man', Joseph Smith accomplished in 38 years--in spite of manipulated public opinion, open hostilities, religious bigotry, superstitious ignorance, mob mentality, and the hypocritical political forces of his day. Ouch! It is a wonder anyone survived the 19th century with any sanity in tact.Bushman has captured facets of 'the man', Joseph Smith, not normally considered by those who read about him with today's bias. It is a well documented work with almost 200 pages of references.But reader, make no mistake---this book of analysis is in fact NOT an evaluation of a prophet of God as seen amongst his contemporary prophets of the world and in the cultures of their day.This book DOES NOT compare Smith as 'a prophet of God' with cultural prophets of history, like Abraham--the polygamist, and the warrior who fought against neighboring cities to free his nephew, Lot from kidnappers; like Jacob, the polygamist, who deceived his own blind father for his brother's birthright, who had sons that slaughtered men in a nearby town for one of them raping their sister (Dinah), and that sold their own brother (Joseph) into foreign slavery; like Moses--who murdered Pharaoh's officer, claimed revelation from burning bushes, led his people into a barren desert, and who never enter into 'the promised land (Zion) he promised to take the people into; like Isaiah--the intellectual who prophesied political leaders were going to die--then changed his mind and prophecy 'from days' to 15 years, and who spoke of God coming from heaven to earth as 'a man' born of a virgin, to be slaughtered as 'a lamb' by his own people; like Hosea--who married a prostitute to stir up the Isrealites to the stench of their own adultery; or like Jesus--who was feared, hated, and conspired against by the religious leaders of his day, and who the historian Josephus said had a polygamist marriage to both Martha and her sister, Mary, etc. No it is not that kind of a book at all! It would be too much for a modern historian to write about a man 'claiming to be a prophet of God' to be seen through the cultural lens of, and be compared with other historic men who called themselves 'prophets,' and who lived and died for the wild claims that they believed. That kind of cultural research would, of course, be asking too much of a 21st Century historian to include in his history! It would ruin his credibility and no one would buy his book.Whether you like Smith's and Bushman's religion or not, this is a good read, but brace yourself--it is also a good reminder to all of us that not everyone sees us as we may view ourselves. 4 stars for Bushman writing about 'the man', in his day, and amongst his 19th century contemporaries and their culture!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Rough Stone Rolling is a book that definitely is interesting and has many good qualities about it. With that being said, though, let me say that it's not the only book on Joseph Smith and early Mormonism that a person should read. Since Bushman is LDS, he certainly has presuppositions and an agenda, and while he does provide much truth, there are times he doesn't elaborate very much and thus softens the implications of any information he is sharing. Thus, I think this book ought to be read in conjunction with other biographies on Smith and the history of the LDS Church, of which there are many.Let me recommend three that you ought to consider: The Rise of Mormonism (1816-1844) by H. Michael Marquardt, which I read in conjunction with Rough Stone and which I thought provided a more truthful image of the man; One Nation Under Gods by Richard Abanes, a fascinating read and well worth the time; and finally, Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon by David Persuitte, which, though not a pure biography, provides a lot more background information on the life of Smith during the 1820s.It is interesting that an earlier review on this book from an LDS member said that negative information provided in Rough Stone Rolling ought to be considered with a grain of salt. Mentioning the fact that Bushman says Smith Sr. was once a drunk, the writer wrote: \\"...while true, (this) doesn't help to strengthen the weak of heart.\\" This sums up the problem with the religion of Mormonism. If there is information that is considered non-faith-promoting, many Saints believe that it ought to be avoided. But I think every person ought to study the life of the Mormon founder and find out as much truth as he/she can. If Joseph Smith is, as Mormons believe, a prophet of God, then by all means everyone ought to consider one of the religions that claims to be his true followers (as there are well over 100 groups claiming Smith as their leader). If, however, if it can be shown that this man was a fraud, then any church claiming him as their founder ought to be avoided at all costs. This just isn't my opinion but that of 10th LDS President Joseph Fielding Smith who once said, \\"Mormonism, as it is called, must stand or fall on the story of Joseph Smith. He was either a prophet of God, divinely called, properly appointed and commissioned, or he was one of the biggest frauds this world has ever seen. There is no middle ground.\\" My suggestion is to read both sides and come away with a conclusion that satisfies your research, regardless of what facts you might encounter."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Bushman' preface tells us that this \\"biography\\" is a \\"believers\\" perspective on Joseph Smith's life and time. Thus, Bushman's book is valuable as insight into how devout, believing, practicing Mormons view Joseph's life.To me, as a \\"gentile\\", the book seems like great material for a seminary class or a testimony meeting. The basic Mormon \\"testimony\\" statement goes something like \\"I have a testimony of the truth of the Book of Mormon and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.\\" I also imagine that this book might be good material for missionary training. But I have some problems with the historical scholarship. (See the end of my review.)Regardless of my problems with Bushman's text, Joseph Smith is an interesting and complicated character. He has had a lasting impact, and fathered a religion that has members around the world. His life, as well as the religion and church he founded, is well worth studying. But then the same could be said of Ellen White, L. Ron Hubbard, Mary Baker Eddy, and many others.Bushman does give us a valuable, well written (but at times tedious), insight into a believer's perspective on Joseph. But the value of this book as history and biography is problematic. When the historical evidence suggests conflicting interpretations, or negative interpretations, of Joseph, and exposes some of the \\"rough edges\\", Bushman never deviates from his testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. Consequently Bushman always seems to be able to smooth the edges of this \\"rough stone rolling\\". In doing so there are some misrepresentations and omissions which diminish the value of this book as a serious study of Joseph's life and times.Bushman has solved the biography problem for believing Mormons who have waited over 60 years for an alternative, and antidote, to Fawn Brodie's \\"No one Knows my History\\". But I don't think he has transcended Brodie's work.If you are not a believing Mormon, a better introduction to Joseph Smith would be Robert Remini's short biography (182 pages), \\"Joseph Smith\\". Then tackle Bushman's tome (561 pages of text).Problems with Bushmans text:1. Bushman, as Mormon historians and General Authorities have done for over 100 years, misrepresents and distorts the perspective of Josiah Quincy. A century ago B. H. Roberts claimed that Quincy was \\"on our side\\". In the prologue (pp. 1-7), Bushman represents Quincy as a benign \\"puzzled skeptic\\". In fact Quincy saw Joseph and his religious movement as an \\"evil fanaticism\\" and likens Joseph to Thomas Muntzer (Mulhausen) and Jan van Leydon (Munster). This is clearly stated in the opening paragraph of Quincy's essay, along with comments about \\"demoralizing doctrines\\", \\"still darker revelations\\", and the assertion that Joseph's religion is \\"subversive of every duty which we claim from the citizen\\". ( For the significance of the references to Mulhausen and Munster see Norman Cohn, The Pursuit of the Millennium, pp. 234-280 and Anthony Arthur, The Tailor-King).My concern is not with the merits of Quincy's essay. (You can read Quincy for yourself at www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/JQuincy.html) Rather it is that Bushman's representation of Quincy as a benign \\"puzzled skeptic\\" is at best inaccurate. Quincy's puzzlement is of a very different nature than Bushman would have us believe. I think Quincy's statements might be closer to what Bushman call the \\"anti-Mormon argument\\" (p. 510). But Quincy's personal position on Joseph and his followers would be closer to Thomas Gregg's (p. 532).There are three other misrepresentations of Quincy. Towards the end of the book, Bushman quotes Quincy as saying the Nauvoo temple architecture is \\"odd and striking\\"(p. 504). But Quincy also said the temple was \\"grotesque\\"! In short he was not favorably impressed. On page 522 Bushman says \\"Quincy was surprised to hear Joseph invite a Methodist to preach from a Mormon pulpit.\\" In Quincy's text the Methodist minister was clearly surprised at the invitation. But Quincy does not reveal his reaction to this invitation. Given Quincy's descriptions of the banter between Joseph and the minister, I think it would be more appropriate to say Quincy was at best amused.On page 560 Bushman says \\"Quincy saw in him \`that kingly faculty that directs, as by intrinsic light.\\" Bushman puts a period at the end of this quote when there should have been an ellipsis. The sentence concludes \\"the feeble or confused souls who are looking for guidance.\\" Why did Bushman suggest that the sentence ended at \\"intrinsic light\\"? What was Quincy trying to say by this remark? Quincy clearly recognized Joseph as a natural and charismatic leader. While Quincy acknowledged Joseph's leadership strengths, this apparent compliment has to be tempered by the reference to \\"feeble or confused souls\\"? Also consider the Mulhausen and Munster references. I don't think that Quincy was in awe of Joseph, or impressed with Joseph in a positive way. Yet in the paragraph that contains this quote, Bushman is expressing his own sense of awe and marvel at Joseph's life and accomplishments. Bushman is entitled to his view of Joseph. But I don't think he is entitled to suggest that Quincy shared his view.2. Bushman's discussion of the \\"View of the Hebrews\\" as a source for Joseph's writing the Book of Mormon (p. 96), fails to cite B. H. Roberts' extended essay documenting similarities between the two books. My concern is not with the merits of Roberts essay. The problem is that Bushman completely ignores Roberts essay in discussing this topic, as well as Roberts essay on archeological evidence for the Book of Mormon. (p. 92) (Roberts essays are published by Signature Books: \\"Studies of the Book of Mormon\\", 1985, www.signaturebooks.com)I could cite more problems but I would greatly exceed what I think is the appropriate length for an Amazon review."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book has given me a more in depth look into events of Joseph Smith's life before and after being a prophet of God.

But to what end? Can any history of a person claiming direct communication with the Divine be \\"objective\\"? Indeed, should it? The revelatory experiences Joseph Smith claimed to have had either happened or they did not. If Joseph's accounts were true, of what relevance is it that other individuals in his age also claimed revelations? If God actually instructed Joseph Smith to engage in polygamy, of what relevance is it other charismatic leaders were preaching free love? If Joseph Smith or his associates somehow concocted volumes of fake scripture, it is of no more importance to me than Mark Hoffman's works -- interesting, but worthless.Richard Bushman tells an interesting -- perhaps even excellent -- history of the man Joseph Smith and his times.

He does have some good details i didn't know about, but If you believe in Joseph Smith and want a faith promoting book about the Prophet Joseph this is not the book for you. Lots of details of stuff i never knew before about Joseph but Bushman likes to cast as much skeptisim on Joseph as a believer can and not be excomunicated. I didn't like the way he always brings up controversy and then seems to skip over some of the amazing well documented spiritual experiences. He brings up for example that some authors speculate he made the plates while at the hill cumorah out of tin. Then he spends 20 pages on the criticisms of the book of Mormon. I got enough of what the anti-mormons think on my mission and now I don't give a horses hair to know what skeptics think. Why bring up garbage???!!! Bushman does this way toooooo much!!! There are things that are accepted by latter-day prophets that he brings controversy on such as the where the church was first organized. As a committed LDS who loves the gospel and loves Joseph I strongly counsel to find other great books on Joseph. I love the bio by his mother. I also found \\"Remembering Joseph: Personal Recollections of Those Who Know the Prophet Joseph Smith\\"by Mark L. McConkie to be excellent. Both of these give well documented accounts of the prophets life and don't mix truth with the doctrines of devils and other unbelievers. I mean why does Bushman quote Fawn Brodie? Her book about Joseph was garbage!! As one friend mentioned, \\"use Bushman's book to start a camp fire with.\\" I think I will. I didn't like it!! I didn't like how i felt as i read it.

This book is so-information filled that it will have you rereading paragraphs left and right. I usually read 100 pages of a book every day, but when I first got this whopper, and read 100 pages, I literally spent 3 or 4 hours. I've gotten 300 pages in, and I finally decided that I will use this book for reference only, because it is so overloaded with information, that it is almost not enjoyable for pleasurable reading; this book should mostly be used for reports, essays, or for hardcore history buffs.Overall, it is not Mr. Bushman's fault that the slow, factual pace is too overwhelming for me. I highly recommend this book if you need to know A LOT about Joseph Smith (this is probably the most in-depth biography I've ever read), but if you only need to know an overall history, just read shorter biographies or Wikipedia."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"A very informative, enlightening book on Mormon history and it's founder. Really gives you a new perspective of Joseph Smith. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a better understanding of a \\"more real\\" Mormon history than the somewhat watered down version that most are aware of."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Having previously read Fawn Brodie'sNo Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, I read this one to get the believer's view. Bushman is at his best describing the evolution of Smith's thinking and revelations. Although the book is long, it is well written and authoritative. It gives a deeper understanding of Smith's religious philosophy than does Brodie's book.To his credit, Bushman confronts many of the crucial controversies surrounding Smith. From my non-believer's perspective, however, the defenses of Smith are not remotely convincing. Some examples:1. DNA analysis shows without question that the American Indians came from east Asia. This fact is in direct contradiction of the traditional LDS view that Native Americans are lost Israelites. Bushman argues that Smith may have been writing about a small tribe somewhere in New York, or about people outside North America altogether. Within a few pages, Bushman has forgotten about this controversy altogether, and happily describes the Book of Mormon as a history of the American Indians.2. Smith made the huge mistake of reproducing parts of the hieroglyphics he claims to have interpreted as the \\"Book of Abraham.\\" These documents have been translated by scholars and have nothing to do with Abraham. Bushman (pp. 291-2) puts forth the argument that Smith's translation may not have been a true translation, but instead may have been a divine revelation simply inspired by the presence of the scrolls. Bushman suggests the same for the Book of Mormon. This is a truly shocking stance for an LDS believer to take: if Smith's \\"translations\\" weren't translations, why should anyone believe that his revelations were divinely inspired? Ironically, Bushman's view here sounds much like Brodie's: Not anticipating that scholars would use the Rosetta stone to translate hieroglyphics, Smith imagined that bogus translations would not be found out.3. Smith repeatedly lied about whether he and the Saints were practicing polygamy. Bushman's defense of Smith in this context reminds me of Bill Clinton's statements regarding Monica Lewinsky: Smith held a secret definition of the term \\"polygamy,\\" and thus felt free to mislead (or lie) with impunity. The facts, as reported by both Brodie and Bushman, support the conclusion that Smith coerced women into his bed by arguing that their eternal salvation was at stake. The stain of Smith's lustful \\"revelation\\" regarding polygamy continues to haunt the LDS, which claims to recoil from earthly polygamy but argues that men (not women) get to have harems in heaven.Despite these complaints, I recommend this book to non-believers who are patient enough to get through it. I feel that I have much greater insight into the LDS mindset than I did before."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Okay, I just finished this one and I can sum it up in one word... WOW! So much information I didn't know and there is a lot for me to think about. I thought Bushman does an impeccable job of presenting a fair account of Joseph Smith's life..the good and the bad...no sugar coating. He was definitely a man, prone to all the same follies we go through. But what a man! I have a deeper appreciation of the Prophet and what he did. I appreciate him more, knowing that he definitely was not perfect, just like I am not. But the doctrine is perfect...of this I have no doubt. When I read the scripture he brought forth to our society, it is so beautiful and I know it is from God, because Joseph Smith most assuredly was just a man."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I'm only about 1/4 through it, but I'm already prepared to call this one of my favorite LDS books. The unique perspective it offers on the most critical figure in my faith (outside of Christ of course) is so refreshing.

I'm almost convinced that all the curious aspects of Joseph that I've had a hard time understanding can be clarified by looking more closely at events and circumstances that have been glossed over in other histories.

I wish that some day I will meet him and let him know how he has influenced my life on earth."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Masterfully done! This is the book I would write, were I a legitimate historian and faithful member of the Mormon Church. Bushman does a truly masterful job of tackling Joseph Smith's history as honestly as possible while still permitting the rational Mormon to hold on to their faith. When facing their history, Mormons must confront Joseph Smith and ask a simple yet very loaded question which Bushman summarizes quite well when he asks: Are Joseph Smith's ideas to be attributed to him or God? If the former is true, then the entire Mormon Religion is nothing more than another human fabrication. If the latter is true, then we can finally rest in the comfort that we have the One True Religion and all others can be discarded as false.So how does Bushman accomplish this delicate dance of relating an honest history while preserving Mormon faith? The answer is with subtle yet brilliant footwork. The dance begins with the title, where the problem is blatantly admitted: Joseph Smith is a very rough stone. Bushman then embarks on a most impressive undertaking--to smooth out as much as the roughness as possible. Here are just a few prime examples:- Joseph Smith's heavy involvement in magic during his formative years becomes a \\"preparatory gospel.\\"- Hunting for deception in the reality of the golden plates becomes \\"a distraction that throws us off the track of Joseph Smith the Prophet.\\"- When the prominent scholar, Charles Anthon, refutes the authenticity of the \\"reformed Egyptian\\" characters, we learn of a fulfilled biblical prophecy while no mention is made of the fact that no non-Mormon scholars acknowledge the existence of either a \\"reformed Egyptian\\" language or a \\"reformed Egyptian\\" script.- The debacle of the lost 116 pages and subsequent need for a different translation becomes the catalyst for Joseph Smith's first recorded prophetic revelation.- While Bushman admits the uphill battle scholars face in defending the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon, he shrugs aside this astronomically large problem and ends the discussion with the following quote from non-mormon critics: \\"LDS academicians are producing serious research which desperately needs to be critically examined.\\"Despite Bushman's self-admitted bias, Rough Stone Rolling is truly a must-read for Mormons and non-Mormons alike. For the faithful Saint who is wrestling with some very difficult questions, Bushman offers some answers. For the curious non-Mormon who appreciates how truly remarkable a man Joseph Smith was, this work provides yet another very useful perspective. This work is thought-provoking on many different levels.I will end this review with a few bonus observations. First, I find it interesting that both Mormons and non-Mormons are leaving 1 star reviews. These reviews speak volumes about the profound effect Joseph Smith still has on people. This book soundly deserves 4 stars. It is well written, superbly edited, coherent, and gripping. I withhold the final star because while I cannot ever prove this, I am convinced that Bushman was forced to sacrifice some honesty in order to preserve his faith. I cannot blame him for this. In fact, sometimes I wonder if I am guilty of the same offense."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"An honest review of Joseph Smith's life and the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Bushman said that he tried to approach Joseph Smiths life from his own perspective and tried to show what was in his mind as he played out the almost incredible life experiences and new creations. I have read several biographies and each seems to take a different approach. This book shows all the different possible sources and also perspectives of the people of the day, and also many who doubted that he actually received direct revelation from God, and ability to translate. The author illustrates what was going on in the community and nation as these episodes unfurled. The life of Joseph Smith seems larger than life, even though most of what happened is documented sufficiently that it is hard to disbelieve. The tailings of his life and creations still live. The evolution of beliefs and dogma are expounded on and amplified by his progenitors. I was especially intrigued by his trial and error discovering what really was \\"God's will\\". It seems that it would have been easier and even more credible if he got it right the first time, every time, but then that would not have allowed the growth and development of the participants. This book really shows that \\"God\\" is not just getting us through this process called life, but is challenging and changing our will and endurance with serious trials. This book really shows the trauma and suffering of the early Mormon members and the conflicts that caused some to leave and some to stay with the Church Joseph Smith formed. Although Bushman admits that he is biased, he seems honest in his presentation. Certainly this book creates some conflict with the sanitized versions, but I feel that it does justice to history and reality and brings to light some aspects that previously were only found in anti Mormon books. I felt that Bushman goes in to a lot of historical detail that some may find boring but in the end, I appreciated the complete story that was told. It has strongly supported and expanded my strong belief that this couldn't have been a fabrication but was in fact the process that restored Christ's True and Living Church. True seekers will find this very interesting."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"When you're a child in Sunday School, the lessons are about the words and miracles of Jesus and his prophets. When we're young or new, we need this information most of all in growing our faith from a tiny seed into a tree. And perhaps this possitive spiritual nurturing is what we need most of the time, throughout our lives.But we are human -- all of us. And the prophets are human too. The only perfect person to have lived is Jesus. His prophets have all been mere men. Some of them great men, but men nevertheless.People tend to think that if a man is imperfect, then he cannot truly be a vessel of the Divine. This is a mistake. A closer look at the Bible confirms this. Jonah's disobedience, and his abject hatred of the Ninevites (whom he was sent to save) did not remove his status as a prophet. Abraham's dysfunctional family (including his exile of a wife and young son toward likely death in the desert) did not negate his work as God's chosen prophet. We do not tear the pages of the Psalms from the Bible because they were written by King David, an adulterer and murderer. One can believe or not believe in Joseph Smith's prophetic calling, but it is erronious to use his life as proof. In faith there is no proof but that given to the individual by God.As we mature from childhood, we learn that the prophets are men. We learn that our faith must be rooted in Christ -- the only perfect being to have lived. Our faith in Christ can be helped by all of the prophets and the messages that they have delivered from God. Many of these men have made great sacrifices in the service of God, and they deserve our graditude. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are not supposed to worship prophets. It would be a mistake to mix up prophets with the God who sent them.People have lost their faith because of this mistake.I love \\"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling\\" because it helped me understand that Joseph Smith was human. I read it at a time when I was ready to understand the nature of a prophet better. I come away from reading it feeling closer to the man, and appreciating his sacrifices as well as his imperfections. I see how he was more like me than I thought. I find gentle humor in some of his foibles, I cringe at his larger mistakes, I feel sympathy for his deep sorrows, and I feel new respect for his remarkable work.I do believe that the beautiful lessons we learn as children are the most important: God lives. He loves us. He sent his son. Follow Jesus and you will know peace. Pray. Follow the prophets to learn of God's great power and miracles, because he can and will exercize that power for you. This book helps me understand one of those prophets. It helps eliminate confusion. It makes it easier for me to distinguish between the human being and the divine calling. With confusion eliminated, I can focus better on the basics delivered through all prophets. I think those basics are what really matter most."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I would like to start the review admitting I am not a Mormon. I love biographies of great people in history. I read \\"No man knows my History\\" by Fawn Brodie. I came on that book by accident. And I realize from some of the reviews on Amazon that Mormons dont like that book much. I thought it was great, but admit that she paints Joseph Smith in a negative light sometimes. But I could still see through enough to see a great man behind her attacks on his character.\\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" is the exact opposite of that book. Richard Bushman uses a lot of the same stories but doesnt have the same negative slant. But he still shows that Joseph Smith was not perfect, which I admire. This is the best biography I have ever read.This book takes you all through Joseph Smith's life. From a farmboy in New York who got on his knees and asked God to show him the way, to the man who was gunned down in Carthage a martyr for his calling.If he was a Prophet or not is up for debate. As a Christian I believe that God is real and God can still speak today. Before I read the history of Joseph Smith if someone asked me if he was a prophet, I would have said no. After reading up on the man I would answer that it is not out of the realm of possibility. I believe he believed he was a prophet. I believe that some unexplainable things happened around him and the early Church.The question was he a great man or not has been settled in my mind at least. I think he was a great man. To be tared and feathered and beaten, and still preach that next morning. To take persecutions and imprisionment in stride, to never compromise what you believe even in the face of death. These things are the very definition of a great man. The fact he put people off sometimes because he played with children and liked to wrestle and have fun. I think it just shows a genuine human being. His great love for his people caused many of his mistakes in life. Like the idea of everybody having everything in common, and his business dealings. Everything he did was with his people in mind. He not only talked the talk but walked the walk. I encourage everyone to read this book. If for nothing else than read a well written, entertaining biography of a real person that is more interesting than fiction. Good day."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"It's hard to overestimate just how much Richard Bushman's long-awaited biography of Joseph Smith has been eagerly anticipated by Mormon readers. Now that it's finally here it would be only natural if it didn't live up to expectations. The thing is--it's just as good as we all hoped it would be. \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" is the culmination of almost forty years of what has been called \\"the new Mormon history.\\" It's impossible for LDS writers to be objective about Joseph given his place in LDS history, so Bushman aims for balance and candor and succeeds brilliantly.When I was growing up as a Mormon I have to admit that much of the LDS writing about Joseph was an obstacle to my faith. According to many he was a ideal man without flaw, a sort of 19th-century superhero. This made him a papier-mache saint that was impossible to relate to on a human level. Bushman describes a man who trusted the wrong people at times; was hotheaded, impulsive, and contentious; couldn't abide personal criticism; was a lousy businessman--in short, a man with familiar human foibles. On the other hand he had a large, open heart, an expansive view of human possibilities, and an almost scary insight into the religious quandries of our lives. He was able to convince many, many others that the heavens had been opened. Much of 19th century Protestantism seemed spiritually dead as a stone; Joseph and his followers believed he had restored the flow of revelation that had existed in Biblical times. He became a prophet in a distinctly American vein.Perhaps his most famous line for non-Mormons was \\"no man knows my history; if I hadn't lived it I wouldn't have believed it myself.\\" Bushman captures the sheer mystical mystery of Joseph's life. Watching Bushman's Joseph is a little like watching William Blake or even Joan of Arc: how such miraculous things happened still can't be fully explained in this life and one can only marvel at what has been left behind. Bushman's explication of the Book of Mormon is as searching and fascinating as we are likely to get, and yet it only scratches the surface of this American scripture. Joseph came to personify will and energy, and with the sheer force of history turned America into the promised land. From now on, all future attempts to write about Joseph will have to deal with Bushman."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Desiring some basic understanding of Mormonism, I asked a priest friend from Utah to recommend a book. He said that it is hard to find a good book because writings on Mormonism tend to be either Mormon propaganda or anti-Mormon attacks. He did mention that a lot of people were reading *Under the Banner of Heaven* by Jon Krakauer. It turned out be a slash-and-burn attack not only on Mormonism, but religion in general. Shortly after reading Krakauer's book, I discovered *Rough Stone Rolling.* What a contrast! And what an amazing accomplishment! As both a practicing Mormon and a Columbia University professor, Dr. Bushman enables an outsider (like myself) to appreciate the life and times of Joseph Smith.Before commenting on *Rough Stone Rolling,* I want to make an obvious (but necessary) disclaimer: As a Catholic I do not accept the basic thesis of Mormonism - namely, that Jesus founded a Church and then allowed it to fall into apostasy until a nineteenth century American named Joseph Smith restored it. Mormons believe that, with the death of the last apostle, the Church also died. Catholics, by contrast, believe that the pope and bishops are successors of the apostles.With that disclaimer in mind, I must say that Dr. Bushman helped me appreciate the great genius of Joseph Smith. At a time when rationalism was robbing people of a direct experience of God, Smith convincingly presented himself as a prophet and wanted others to have similar revelations from God. But he also recognized the need for authority to prevent individual revelations from fracturing the community. In the process he set up structures very familiar to Catholics: a priesthood, a hierarchy with one final authority and rituals which connect believers to divine mysteries. *Rough Stone Rolling* details the steps involved in the creation of a church that would impact the lives of millions of people.Joseph Smith lived only thirty-eight years, but he had a greater long-term influence than any nineteenth century American. In some ways he was the quintessential American. Emerging from very humble origins, Smith embodies the American ideal of the self-made man. And he had democracy deep his bones: Notwithstanding his extraordinary revelations, he did not put on airs; he wanted all of his follower to receive revelations. Above all, Joseph Smith was a quintessential American in his can-do spirit. Build the heavenly Zion here on earth? No problem. Let's do it right here in Missouri. And when they drove him out of Missouri, he started over again in Illinois with an even bolder vision. That is the American spirit - and Joseph Smith incarnated it to the nth degree.As Bushman brings out in great detail, Joseph Smith not only had faith in his personal revelations; he had great faith in his country and its constitution. Even when that country treated him badly, he kept faith that its institutions would bring him vindication. In the end the legal system and its officers failed him and he died at the hands of a mob while being held in the Carthage, IL, jail.Joseph Smith's life provides much material for reflection. I would like to mention two areas that particularly called my attention. The first relates to Joseph Smith's \\"can do\\" spirit. It has a downside: a peculiar blindness to the reality of man's fallen nature (original sin). Bushman describes Smith as someone who underestimated the evil in his enemies, his followers - and himself. It came out most dramatically in the shameful treatment of his wife. He tried to give Emma everything, but in the end he did not give her what he had pledged and what she most desired: Joseph himself.A second question *Rough Stone Rolling* raises is how we as a society accommodate people who have very different beliefs. Can we appeal to a \\"natural law\\" which binds everyone? I believe we can. For example, that it is wrong to defraud, break a contract, physically harm or take an innocent human life. Also, I believe, we can argue from the basis of the natural law that marriage is an institution that binds one man and one woman in a life-long and exclusive union. At the same time, I am concerned that our society is falling into what Pope Benedict called a \\"dictatorship of relativism.\\" That is, many people have despaired of articulating a natural law applicable to all - and instead feel that the only thing we have left is a kind of mob rule, where matters are decided simply on the basis of who (or what group) is most powerful politically. The life of Joseph Smith - and his continuing influence among Mormons - provides a dramatic test case for these important questions. And it appears that, if we continue to move in the direction of a dictatorship of relativism, Catholics, Mormons and other people of faith, will have many occasions to stand together for the rights of conscience."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I've had this preordered for months and was happy to receive it in the mail and read it as fast as I could. Fawn Brodie wrote the most accepted and well written Joseph Smith Biography and it has irked Mormons for over fifty years that the definitive work on Joseph Smith saw him as a talented religious organizer, but, overall a fraud. Since that time occasional biographies come out-but lack the writing or research of Brodie. Also, add into any study of Joseph that writing about Mormonism is anything but objective. You don't find many people without an opinion of Joseph Smith. Some write about him to proselyte, other write as iconoclasts. The key is an honest and thorough treatment.Bushman is well equipped to take on the task of a new definiative Joseph Smith biography. The author said he was workling on this for seven years and it shows. Considered by many the best Mormon historian since Leonard Arrington, he does better that most to try and flesh out and construct a human Joseph, while also allowing for the possibility of divine inspiration. Thoroughly research and aided by the author's expertise as a historian who specializes in the area and time of Joseph Smith, he provides excellent contextualization and placement for Joseph and his movement.The writing is near excellence. A little thick at times, but more often flowing and allowing for artistic articulation. I could only see a few minor notes I would add were I to be the proof reader. I feel like I would be greedy to criticize orask for more than is presented overall.The book follows Joseph from a poor New England upbringing through, local superstition and magic practices, religious retrenchment, visions, controversial gold plates, the formation of church and utopian cities, conflict within and without, to his run for presidency and assassination.This book may not be comfortable for all orthodox Mormons. The author shows integrity by questioning traditional timelines of priesthood restoration. He presents plural Marriage with a lot of the facts that are commonly left out,like marriages to women who were already married to another man. He discusses josephs failures and struggles. He includes an ocassional item that may not fit with the orthodox narrative. There is no whitewash here. Yet he presents a sincere and loyal Joseph Smith. One who is believing and intelligent. A man with weaknesses, but also a man considered by millions to be a 19th century prophet. He makes Joseph appear new and real, and brings in fresh sources for even those well read on the subject.This book does faithful Mormon studies proud. As I read I made a mental list of controversial subjects, wondering if he would he address them, and found almost all of them were addressed, while allowing the narrative to flow. The skeptic may think too much benefit of the doubt is given to Joseph. Counter points are in here, but when he can the author gives the subject the benefit of the doubt. The footnotes are wonderful. A good jumping off point for further reading.Time will tell if the book will gain as much acceptance outside on the Mormon community as Fawn Brodies. A must read for those interested in Mormon studies, but also a good read for outsiders who want to explore Mormonism from a faithful yet honest perspective."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"The footnotes comprise about 20% of the content of this book - all in a section at the end. In the Kindle edition there are no direct links to the footnotes from the text, making them nearly impossible to find as you read, unless you track the location numbers as you go along (very tedious). If you are interested in reading the footnotes (and in a book like this, why wouldn't you be?) buy the hard copy."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As a trial lawyer, I am always amazed by the reaction of jurors to the reality of human memory and the surpassing difficulty of determining intent and motive. Nobody's stories mesh, everyone perceives things differently--the same person can honestly tell stories with contradictions; and if you do not believe it, let a good lawyer take you on cross-examination. Now take the whole exercise back two hundred years, with the attendant degradation of the record and the reliance, of necessity, upon hearsay. In short, the problems of writing the biography of an historical figure such as Joseph Smith are well beyond the appreciation of most readers. Mr. Bushman's work bears the stamp of meticulous research; he does not shy from confronting the popular arguments and weaves his arguments not from his admitted faith in the man but from the actual events and the flawed and incomplete historical record.This reviewer accepts Joseph Smith as what he purported to be--a Prophet who received revelation directly from God as did the Prophets of the Bible. The religious among us will accept their duty to answer to God as to whether they followed the biblical injunction to judge righteous judgment--by their fruits shall ye know them. Joseph Smith's teachings have endured and have developed in exactly the manner that one would expect and that the Prophet predicted. I loved this biography precisely because it portrayed the man who was a Prophet--a man who refused, sometimes unwisely, to take the safe path; a man who overcame the lack of social and educational advantages in a quintessentially American fashion; a man who made dumb mistakes just like we all do but who maintained an absolute optimism. A man who was sometimes too quick to trust, regularly overworked, frequently disappointed and who was often betrayed by his own better instincts--but he learned from his mistakes and he was absolutely faithful to the light he had received. Judge him by the Book of Mormon, which he translated, judge him by the leaders he trained, by Brigham Young and by his successor, Gordon B. Hinckley, judge him by a Church whose members and temples span the globe, judge him by the good works of those who follow his revelations as such, judge him by what he accomplished in such a short life, judge by the focus of his writings upon Jesus Christ, but don't judge him because some reporter or diarist recorded events with discrepancies or because of a wrinkle in Joseph's recollection of unprecedented events.In Rough Stone Rolling, Mr. Bushman walks the path of truth--he admits his bias towards belief but backs up his statements. He calls it as he sees it while still admitting that there are arguments both ways. He demonstrates that a positive faith-promoting history does not need to ignore difficult issues. Mr. Bushman realizes and acknowledges that at some level any beliefs regarding the Prophet end up being based upon faith--whether faith in DNA analysis of Indians, faith in the recollection and accuracy of persons long dead, faith in one's personal perceptions and powers of analysis, or in a divine witness of truthfulness; the book shows that Joseph dealt with persons of all such motivations but that Joseph ultimately succeeded based upon the actions and support of those who professed a divine confirmation of their queries regarding Joseph.In this his record is superior to advocative portrayals that set forth only positive or negative arguments. Joseph, like all the Prophets before and since, summed it up correctly when he stated that though he made mistakes, there were no errors in the revelations he gave to the Church. This work succeeds in revealing Joseph's life; one cannot fully appreciate Joseph's achievements without a knowledge and understanding of the opposition he faced and overcame. As to his status as the Prophet, each reader must come to and be prepared to defend his or her own judgment. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally.

Bushman does not shy away from the controversial, presenting Joseph as somebody who I can finally relate to as a human being, rather than some kind of perfect \\"way up there\\" godlike being that Primary and Sunday School (intentionally or not) portray him.It was a relief for me to read of Joseph's mistakes in addition to his many amazing accomoplishments as a prophet, mayor, general, presidential candidate and much more.I love how honest Brother Bushman is in the book's preface: \\"A believing historian like myself cannot [...] pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. What I can do is to look frankly at all the sides of Joseph Smith, facing up to his mistakes and flaws. Covering up errors makes no sense in any case. Most readers do not believe in, nor are they interested in, perfection. We want to meet a real person.\\"Brother Bushman has \\"undertaken to explore a side of Joseph Smith not adequately examined in other biogrophies: his religious thought.\\" Thus, we are able to peer into the mind and thoughts of the prophet - to a degree never before accomplished.What motivated him to make the choices he made? Why did he sometimes seem to \\"lie\\" in regards to poligamy, the danites, his political motivations, etc? Why was he so \\"secretive\\" of his past, the BOM translation, his early visions, etc? All of these and other questions are addressed and we are given a deeper understanding by peering into the mind and \\"religious thought\\" of the prophet.For those wondering how much of Brother Bushman's previous work 'Joseph Smith and the beginnings of Mormonism' is contained in this work, he answers that in the preface: \\"Large portions of chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5\\" are recycled in this book.I can't praise this book enough. I loved it so much that I bought a second copy to loan out to friends from church. (Yes, I am an active LDS.) I also bought a copy for my Dad for Christmas. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a true and balanced history of Joseph Smith, the prophet. It is true that it shows \\"negative\\" sides to the prophet, but these are all very well documented and could not be ignored. I for one appreciate the inclusion of all the facts, not just the ones that place Joseph in a good light.It is as historian Terry L. Givens states on the back cover: \\"Clearly the definitive biogrophy for generations to come. The most balanced, thorough, and insightful treatment to date--truly a masterful work.\\""},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Occasionally members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints come across information about their church they did not know about. Many members dismiss it as false information, baseless criticism, or just irrelevant history. But for many others including myself, these facts are troubling and faith shaking.One of the most difficult things for a believing member in this situation is the process of sorting out the facts around Mormon history. For those of us in this predicament Bushman's work is a tremendous help. The amount of research and effort that went into this book would have been difficult for the average person to accomplish.There are a several things I like about this book and just one suggestion I feel would have improved it. First, I like that Bushman is not an apologist in this work. True to his humble nature he gently introduces his own thoughts or interpretations, often with the word \\"perhaps\\". His suggestions are minimal and compliment rather than detract from the narrative. This is a welcome contrast to books like Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" where the author's interpretation overshadows the narrative.Second, I like that Bushman addresses all the major issues. Some of the topics are just plain ugly, and the fact that he did not avoid them adds to his credibility.One small suggestion. Quotations in the book were often interwoven in such a way that in the same paragraph you are jumping between Bushman's writing and the text of a source document. I like to be able to separate the two and include more of the source quote because I find it easier to understand the context.Finally, I appreciate how well Bushman understands the need for his book. I found the following quotes on a blog that had recorded Bushman's speech at a seminar. According to the blog author these are Bushman's words:\\"Increasingly teachers and church leaders at all levels are approached by Latter-day Saints who have lost confidence in Joseph Smith and the basic miraculous events of church history. They doubt the First Vision, the Book of Mormon, many of Joseph's revelations, and much besides. They fall into doubt after going on the Internet and finding shocking information about Joseph Smith based on documents and facts they had never heard before.Disillusioned Latter-day Saints feel their trust has been betrayed. They don't know whom to trust. They don't dare trust the old feelings that once were so powerful, nor do they trust church leaders. They can only trust the new knowledge they have acquired.At this point, these questioners go off in various directions. Some give up on the Church entirely. They find another religion or, more likely these days, abandon religion altogether.Others piece together a morality and a spiritual attitude that stops them from declining morally, but they are not in an easy place. When they go to church, they are not comfortable. Sunday school classes and Sacrament meeting talks about Joseph Smith and the early church no longer ring true.\\"That is a very good summary of what many Mormons are experiencing right now. It is very helpful to have a credible and trustworthy source of information as we sort out those difficult feelings and find a way forward.Thank you Mr. Bushman for writing this book."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Certainly one of the most difficult of biographical projects is to undertake a controversial religious figure like Joseph Smith. Until this book, Joseph Smith biographies have either been hagiographies or have treated Smith as a charismatic charlatan. The hagiographies are of little interest to those seeking a reasonably objective and scholarly account. However, the books treating Smith as a charismatic charlatan fail as well, for they offer no understanding of how Smith succeeded in setting up a religion which not only survived but thrived after he was dead. And it is this which makes Smith worth studying. There are more interesting characters than Smith to study if one's interest is just debunking a charlatan. It is how Smith succeeded at what Harold Bloom calls \\"religion-making\\" that sets Smith apart. And it is here where Bushman exceeds any other Smith biography - indeed attempts what no other Smith biography attempts. This is to try to understand Joseph Smith as a creator of a new religious worldview. Of course, all of the controversial matters are covered fairly and as completely as space allows in a one volume work. However, this biography also for the first time gives us a realistic portrait of a very human and flawed man who nonetheless behaved as though he was driven by a holy vision, a vision of a saintly commonwealth both in the heavens and on earth - a vision which engaged thousands of his contemporaries and continues to engage millions today."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Although not a member of the Latter-day Saints, I've long been fascinated by the history and theology of this unique American religion. Whether one admires or despises the Mormons, (and I'd place myself in the former camp) no honest observer can deny the Latter-Day Saints' commitment to moral values, the appeal their lifestyle offers to millions of believers, or their church's worldly success. With 'Rough Stone Rolling' Richard Bushman has given readers a fine biography of Joseph Smith, the charismatic and controversial founder of the Latter-Day Saints. Bushman has his biases - he's a believing Latter-Day Saint - and some might argue that he allows apologetic touches to shade his telling of history. Believers will inevitably see a different Joseph Smith than doubters, and perhaps no one historian could capture the complexities of a prophet who founded a religion of family values yet practiced magic and polygamy and had frequent run-ins with the law. With all that, this is a well-researched and eminently readable biography of a gifted theological innovator which conveys a sense of how its subject was able to inspire believers to take part in a new religious movement."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is an excellent book. It is so much more honest than his other book, \\"Joseph Smith, Beginnings of Mormonism.\\" Before, Bushman tended to continue the tradition of giving a more edited history, and did not broach some of the more difficult details of church history that tend to go unmentioned. He did in this book.Bushman writes in a way that allows the reader of this book to interpret the meaning of the facts he presents. We all bring our background, preconceived notions of Joseph Smith, and other biases to this book and they effect our perception as we read it. Some will leave the book more firm in their faith in Joseph Smith, others won't. Likely your personal belief about whether or not Joseph Smith was an actual prophet will effect your interpretation of the life of Joseph as presented in this book.For many active Latter-Day Saints, many of the historical issues mentioned in this book may be new and perhaps a shock. I know despite having been born into the church, having served an honorable mission, married in the temple, and maintaining activity in the church throughout, I never really new much about church history. It was not until a few years ago, in my early 30's, that I discovered many of the unmentioned historical facts that predominate church history, but are not mentioned despite their truth. The historical stories given in church are arguably intentionally edited to be faith promoting. As an example, when was the last time it was ever mentioned in church that Joseph Smith had polygamous wives? I could not have named one wife of Joseph other than emma. Yet he had at least 30 others. When was there ever a discussion that some of his marriages were to very young women (teenagers) who lived in his house? That there was severe tension in Joseph's relationship with Emma because of these marriages, and that Emma struggled with the issue long after Joseph's death? How many times is Joseph's early treasure hunting mentioned, or that much, if not most of the Book of Mormon translation occurred with a peepstone in his hat? This is not conjecture, or historical argument, it is objective historical fact with sources coming from those friendly to the church, or within the church itself. How many times have the issues with regard to the translation of the Book of Abraham been given air in church? Bravo to Bushman for acknowledging that this history exists and being intillectually honest with readers. So often those who even engage in any discussion of these issues are deemed apostates, despite the truth of this history. History which is revised or intentionally forgotten, but is nevertheless true, is more painful when discovered. Why not be upfront about these issues as well as the large quantity of faith promoting stories with which we are all more familiar?But even on these issues, Bushman portrays Joseph as sort of an enigma. Although Bushman mentions these issues which are candidly not faith promoting, much of the other parts of the book are. Joseph is very human, larger than life, and seems to be on a mission in Bushman's book. Many of his actions seem to noble. He is both a hero and a tragic figure. This history is unlikely to change many people's faith. However, I bet there will be some testimony analyzing by some faithful readers, and some relief that it is still intact by the end of the book. It will certainly strengthen some, and cause others to question. But historical facts are just that, facts. They should not be ignored or should public discussion of these issues be muted.Those who believe Jospeh was a false prophet will have their view reinforced by this book. Even Bushman seems at times to be questioning the source of Joseph's revelations..., whether or not there is less of a revelatory, and more of a psychological source to the revelations.Either way, this book will probably not change your mind. But that is the greatness of the book. Joseph was an enigma, and the book does a great deal in illustrating this point."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This was a very readable, very enjoyable, and thought provoking biography. I found that things made alot of sense when other perspectives were put on the table. This wasn't censored propaganda, but neither was it sensationalized pseudo-intellectualism, pretending to be open minded and unbiased while giving unabashed creedance to every self-interested critic of the Prophet. This was refreshingly objective - it was a struggle at times for a believer but in the end deeply rewarding. One gets a sense of Joseph Smith the prophet, and the man. By the end of the book, when the mob charges in at Carthage, I felt as though I was losing a personal friend. I can't recommend this book enough, but give it the time it deserves, ponder it, think it through, keep an open mind and don't rush to conclusions. I think the result will be a deepened appreciation and admiration for its subject."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"The title of my review is the essence of this magnificent biography by Mr Bushman. He is a faithful Latter-day Saint (LDS) and a faithful scholar. His thorough work and his diplomatic conclusions of some of the greatest moments of the prophet's life give the reader a notion of how Joseph can be understood today - on his own terms in those days.Having read Brodie's \\"No man knows ...\\" and Hill's \\"Joseph ... the first Mormon\\" and Vogel's \\"Making...\\", the perspective of Bushman becomes the most giving, fruitful and holistic of all the others. Brodie wrote in a beautiful style, provocative; Hill in a wordy and faithful style and Vogel, trying his best to show how geniously creative Joseph was. Bushman comes with a new literary style, he writes in a colourful way; I felt meeting the prophet and hearing him talk. I saw him both thru the eyes of his family, his closest and his enemies. He brought to me what I had missed in the other books, a person who grew strong out of the destiny he thought was divinely guided.Bushman does NOT interfere with the psychological reasons of how's and whereabouts, ie. trying to prove the First Vision or Book of Mormon or Joseph being prophet. He takes the sound approach, to deal with Joseph as he wanted to be dealt with. He shows how outsiders, the \\"anti-Mormons\\" regarded him, and why they also chose the unlawful ways they did, to get rid not only of Joseph but also of his people.Bushman is the type of believer who is not on the \\"protective\\" or counter-argument side. He has used the same sources that Vogel or Brodie did. For example he agrees about the absence of details in the First Vision accounts, but as the diplomat and believer Bushman is, he is not willing to agree about a Joseph who develops his own theology as time goes by. Bushman's Joseph gets more insight and understanding of his own role, his visions as time passes by -he is not the developer of the visions but the receiver and analyst of the vision. Busman's way of reasoning is not imposing, is not ridiculous, on the contrary it is the analysis required by a historian, confronted with contradicting sources and who does not want to do any unnecessary filling in.The new way of handling Joseph, when Bushman goes thru Joseph's revelations, Book of Mormon (in a totally wonderful outmost innovative way!), Book of Moses, Abraham, his King Folett discourse, his plan of Zion, the political kingdom, plural marriage: makes one understand Joseph's theological cosmology (system) and it makes you think: the same issues that for cultural LDS or more atheistic LDS are proofs of some major inventiveness, becomes thru Bushman's pen the spiritual food in the dispensation of time and Bushman makes sense of it.For example:- Instead dealing with possible sources to the revealed books, Bushman puts them in the context of how Joseph and his time would have understood them. In this way Joseph surely would have recognised himself in Nephi of Book of Mormon, the complaining Enoch of Book of Moses and the writer of heavenly secrets as Abraham in Book of Abraham. In this way, the reason for the coming forth of the books becomes logical in the destiny that Joseph believes is divinely guided- Bushman discusses in long paragraphs some episodes that if hastily read can put a doubt on the character of the prophet, one of the them being the abusing scene where Joseph risked being castrated, Fanny Alger (seen by LDS historians as his first plural wife) and Oliver Cowdery and last but not least the small army band that Joseph put together and where his dog played the lead role ...- Some other more bothering stories of the anti-banking case or the great excommunications of Kirtland becomes \\"normal\\" details in the more larger American context and Bushman does not dive into details, the same goes for the massacre of Far West. Bushman puts his energy on how Joseph acted and why did during the Missouri persecutions rather than dramatise.- Bushman gives a large place to the theology of Joseph. His understanding of the priesthood order, three glories and Kingdom of God is knowledge-enhancing. I see more clearly how plural marriage becomes related to these issues and his presentation of Joseph's teaching thru the years shows that many of Joseph's \\"revolutionary\\" ideas where not at all such, cause everything that came forth had a precedent in former revelations, books etc. As I said, Joseph doesn't become that \\"staccato\\".In this - making sense - lies the answer to this man, Joseph, the poor kid of a family in distress, the persecuted, the brave, the magician and the saint. Bushman has detected the red thread in Joseph's theological system and this becomes Bushman's weapon. The prophet shines thru the book, it is not only a politician, an architect or founder of cities and temples, it is the prophet, even if he sometimes behaves weird in our 21st century eyes. Was he weird, was he a dictator or only a supporter of oligarchy, was he adulterer or a man willing to act according to a divine will and in doing so introducing plural marriage? Well, you have to read the book for the answers.Bushman's work has not been easy, but thru Bushman I felt more at ease with what Joseph accomplished, more at ease to perceive Joseph's theological realism - that we could create heaven on earth today thru the rituals, thru the new everlasting gospel. Joseph doesn't become that paradoxical figure of Brodie's or the anti-LDS. Bushman has written the first biography that gives Joseph a chance to explain himself. Bushman has given also a lot of space (more than ordinary) to Emma, Jospeh's dearest and first wife. Women's issues, such as their role in Joseph's theological system is discussed, especially in connection to the new covenant, celestial glory and the foundation of Relief society. Bushman does not agree with many feminists about Joseph ordaining women to priesthood.Joseph was killed in an illegal way, treated inhumanly, but he left behind more than 150 denominations, wonderful temples, a spider web of hierarchy and rich theology. All these have survived the harsh persecutions, dry and cold Rocky mountains and somewhere in Sweden, has lead me, a Liberal protestant, to be amazed by this young lad who launched what the famous LDS scholar Jan Shipps called: a new religious tradition. Today there are at least two living prophets, one, G.B. Hinckley in Salt Lake, Ut and W. McMurray in Independence, Mo, leading Joseph's teachings in different ways in the new millenium. As said above: the stone is still rolling!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"What a wonderful way to get to know the prophet, Joseph Smith... in his own time and place. Starting with brief biographies of his parents and their families and ending with his death, this book is comprehensive yet reader-friendly. To begin to understand a person fully, you have to understand where they came from. This book really helped me to get to know Joseph in his own time period and place; within his own familial and cultural background. As a believing LDS member, I appreciated the openness and direct manner the author used in addressing the more controversial issues. A must read by anyone looking for a balanced (well, as balanced as possible given the enigmatic source material... people either loved or hated him so it's hard to find any non-biased original sources) study into the life of one of the US's most controversial characters."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Although I had previous read \\"The History of Joseph Smith by His Mother,\\" I decided to read this book because I still didn't feel I knew the Prophet Joseph Smith. Dr. Bushman did an honest, excellent job of portraying Joseph accurately and with great candor. His style of writing is wonderfully readable. The book never bogged down as some histories do.Those looking for a faith-promoting view of the prophet's life may want to look elsewhere, yet I came away with the overwhelming impression that Joseph, despite his humanity, could not have been other than that which he claimed to be. At the same time, those who are cynical about the life of the prophet will likely find this balanced and exceptionally fair.Highly recommended. Kudos to Dr. Bushman."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book is both well researched and dense in detail while still being easily readable. Mr. Bushman presents the point of view from LDS church history along with extensive outside references and notes the prevailing criticisms. If you want to read both sides of the story on this controversial man this is the book for you.I am a practicing LDS member but was interested in reading an unvarnished history. I believe Bushman has achieved that while still maintaining his belief in this man as a prophet."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I follow eclectic paganism, but I have had a huge curiosity in Mormonism for a few years now. A friend of mine, a member of the LDS Church for all of his life, recommended this book to me and I am so incredibly glad he did. I have had some preconceived ideas about the faith, but I wanted to start from the foundation, because I think a person should give every topic a fair chance before making judgments. This book was wonderful, very readable (although it took a long time to read), and UNBIASED. Written by a devout LDS member, the book presents the facts, not in a dry manner, but not in a biased one either. The writing was great! There are some topics I wish had been given a little more attention, but other than that, I am very impressed. I am also a stickler for sources and this book was very well research."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This was a very long book to read. Richard Bushman was thorough in his biography on Mormonism's founder and prophet, Joseph Smith. Most books I find on Mormonism are very pro-Mormon with a whitewashed Joseph who was randomly ridiculed for being who he was and several more books that are very anti-Mormon that display a charlatan who was out to impress in order to gain power, money, and women. So, it is hard to make a well informed conclusion on the man with such polar views of him.I saw this book and checked a few of the chapters. I was impressed to see a book on Joseph Smith that talked openly about his treasure seeking and plural wives that was actual written by a Mormon believer. I bought the book and have been engrossed in it ever since. It was surprising to see how open minded Joseph Smith was discussed and the immense history that would lead to the beginnings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Also, I felt that a lot of my own opinions were changed on Joseph Smith.First, I would say that anyone curious about Joseph Smith's own history should read this book. Secondly, I feel that this book leaves the reader with one of two conclusions they can derive. One conclusion is that Joseph Smith made it all up with the intent of bringing back the magic (miracles) that shaped the lives of Biblical characters into a truly American religious frontier along with doctrine as he understood it from the Bible. Another conclusion is that Joseph Smith was truly called of God to restore the Church of Christ to the Earth. Either way you choose to go, Richard Bushman leaves both doors wide open for the reader."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book provides a view of Joseph Smith that helps the reader understand him as a person, his struggles and his goals. As with the prophets of the Bible, he had foibles and overcame problems in his personal as well as his professional life. We felt that the explanations were sufficiently helpful that we purchased this copy to give to a relative."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is a good book. Whether you're an ardent student of American History, a devot Mormon looking to discover more about our founding Prophet, or simply a curious (albeit more serious than most) by-stander who wants to learn more about Joseph Smith, Rough Stone Rolling is a must read. Like any large organization, the LDS Church tends to emphasize the highlights of Joseph Smith's life and de-emphasize his warts and frailties. However, Richard Bushman's research has made Joseph Smith more approachable. Joseph Smith was a man. Plain and simple.As a man, Jospeh followed his spiritual promptings and became the Prophet-founder of a worldwide religion, whose followers number more than 13 million. However, he put his pants on one leg at a time ... just like you and me.A little dense for the casual reader; but nonetheless accessable to nearly every semi-serious student of American history or Mormonism."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Although Mr. Bushman pays some respect to Fawn Brodie's book (which was the main book accepted by many academics prior to the present book), I only offer one criticism to my fellow evangelicals that may be looking for some type of material to allows a meaningful dialogue with our Mormon friends. This is not a book on apologetics, which is a very collateral issue to the author's main purpose (i.e., history). That is to say, the author does pull his punches when he could go much further on the vast problems inherent in all of the books contained within Mormonism. This book is more akin to the book written by the Ostlings 'Mormon America,' but it is even more thorough and keeps its focus from the years 1816 to 1844. It is a must read.Moreover, I highly recommend this book to obtain deep insights into modern Mormonism, and I would read this book in conjunction with the Ostlings' book, Brodie's book, and for the best apologetic book I have read to date, I recommend reading a philosophical critique--even endorsed by Blake Ostler--'The New Mormon Challenge.' For an insight into the day-to-day living of \\"a majority\\" of Mormons (perhaps those trying to gain entrance into the terrestial realm), I recommend 'Leaving the Saints' by Marhta Beck (with a warning about her present lifestyle), and Irene Spencer's 'Shattered Dreams: My Life as a Polygamist Wife.' These latter two books are likely to draw criticism of subjectivism and falsity. Given the progressive revelation of Mormonism, I suspect that it would be difficult for anyone from the inside-out to write a memoir on their experiences without accusation of being objective. Bottom line, purchase this book for your library."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I'm active in the LDS Church, and could see how this book might cause some people some concern, but if you recognize that Joseph Smith was a man, which Bushman does, it's very insightful and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Did not negatively affect my belief in the church or that Joseph Smith was who he claimed to be."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This was a great book. It dealt with hard to understand issues. I read brodies book and this one almost simultaneously. You have to read both of them with an open mind. To me it is clear that Joseph was a prophet of God. obviously he was not perfect.. has there ever been a perfect prophet?? To me there is no other explanation than a prophet called of God."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I have read many histories of Joseph Smith, though I do not claim to have a comprehensive knowledge of all his biographies. I am finding (I am not quite halfway through the book yet) this book to give a new perspective I have not encountered before. Usually we look back in retrospect at the events that shaped the history of the restoration. Bushman's book offers the unique experience to view the events more from the standpoint of those who went through them, not knowing ahead of time what would eventually happen. I don't know how he does it, I just know that is how it occurs for me. One thing he does is set us in the time and place of the people he is writing about, dealing with the contemporary environment Joseph Smith lived in. I have wanted to be a fly on the wall - to sit in the congregation myself, to look into the face, to hear the words of Joseph Smith first hand, and have mourned my inability to do so. This book does a better job than anything I have yet encountered of affording me the opportunity I have sought so long. I am not a student of history, but find myself willing to be informed about history to a degree that is unusual for me. Thank you Richard Bushman."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As a person who lives in Mormon Zion, I am always looking for a good book on the religion of the Latter-day Saints, America's only great native-grown religion. The prophet Joseph Smith has to be one of the most fascinating characters in American history. Whether a prophet, as his followers claim, or a charlatan, as many others accuse him of being, he is, to an impartial observer, something in between in the final analysis. The final interpretation as to who, exactly, Joseph Smith was is a matter of Faith. If you believe his message, he is indeed the prophet. If you are skeptical, he is something less, but no less interesting. Dr. Bushman has written a masterful, well-researched biography of Mr. Smith. As far as this work goes, it is excellent. I do not doubt the sincerity of the author. But one must remember, when reading it, that Dr. Bushman writes from a professional and spiritual bias, as do all biographers, to some extent. I have read numerous biographies of Joseph Smith and histories of the church, and found this one to gloss over some of the more disturbing elements in the life of the Prophet. It would be an appealing read to a Latter-day Saint or good as a supplemental text, but to consider it a definitive and comprehensive accounting of the life of Joseph Smith would be inaccurate. When I finished the book, I gave it to a very close friend of mine who is a practicing, Temple-recommended Saint and he enjoyed the book as well. In the end, Joseph Smith is who we want to make him, and how we make him is determined by our own faith."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"If you're interested in Joseph Smith, the 19th-century prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, this book provides a good, balanced view.

I've been thinking about the book quite a bit the past several months, and I'm sure I will continue to think about it for several more. I'm glad I own the book because I am already starting to think about re-reading it. A good chunk of the book was more an intensely historical commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants than it was a biography of Joseph Smith, and I think it would be very interesting to read the book in conjunction with the D&C.; Bushman made clear that the revelations we read in the D&C; were indeed sought for and received in times of actual need, addressing real problems that Joseph and the saints faced (as the introduction to the D&C; says).As many others have already pointed out, the book definitely presents Joseph Smith as a living, breathing, and fallible human being. Joseph's flaws and errors are objectively presented and discussed in this book, all without a sugar coating. Joseph had a temper. He was not educated and was not particularly intelligent. He was polygamously married to more women than I had realized, some of whom were married to other men when they married Joseph. He occasionally confused prophesy from God with his own hopes and dreams. And yet, this book confirmed my already existing testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, chosen to restore the true Church one final time before Christ himself will reign on the Earth.There are many reasons Bushman's biography has increased my testimony, even though it \\"exposes\\" Joseph's flaws and mistakes. First, Bushman often gives explanations (usually in the footnotes) that allow the historical fact of Joseph's errors to coexist with the spiritual reality of Joseph's calling as a prophet. Second, Joseph never claimed to be perfect (in fact, he called himself a \\"rough stone\\" that the Lord was slowly polishing as he rolled down the hill of his life). Also, Joseph did not always speak the will of the Lord. Every utterance he made was not the word of God. He often said things that he personally hoped for and believed, but were not necessarily spoken as God's prophet. For example, Joseph, as a struggling entrepreneur, sincerely hoped to make the Kirtland bank the centerpiece of an economically bustling Kirtland. Why does that necessarily mean that Joseph was not a prophet when the bank failed? Isn't it possible that Joseph alone hoped that the bank would succeed, but that it was not what the Lord had planned for Kirtland?Another reason why the biography increased my testimony was the reiteration of a principle that I have learned before in Sunday School, but that I don't think I fully appreciated until I read this book. That principle? Joseph sincerely felt that others could experience the same visions and revelations and use the same powers of translation and discernment that he had. For example, the translation of the book of Abraham was apparently a team effort, with Joseph pushing those around him to \\"work out\\" in their minds the meaning of the Egyptian characters on the scrolls. Whenever anyone questioned what he was teaching (polygamy for example), he would tell that person that he or she could receive an independent confirmation of the truth of what he was saying by praying and asking for their own revelation. Joseph taught the leadership of the Church, leading up to the confirmation of the temple in Kirtland, that they should prepare themselves to see the face of God. In other words, Joseph was not some jealous religious dictator, preaching that only he could do the things he had done and demanding blind adherence to his pronouncements. Joseph knew that others could have visions, receive revelations, and perform miracles because he himself had.There are some topics Bushman discusses that I will have to continue to ponder, the two most important ones being Joseph's participation in polygamy with married women and Bushman's contention that the Melchizedek priesthood wasn't given to Joseph and Oliver until after April 6, 1830. But what a great book. Praise to the man, indeed."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"One of my passions in life is the history of the Mormon church. I have never been so excited about a biography in my life. I have been thrilled by new and exciting works put together by honest scholars who assemble historical papers and evidence in as close to a non-bias approach as possible.I have been overwhelmed by the book, Rough Stone Rolling. This book portrays the Prophet Joseph Smith as an original and human character. There are revealings of weaknesses and faults along with strengths and gifts. What I love most about this work is the detail given to personal accounts and journals of loyal witnesses as well as disaffected and even dis-interested observations. These accounts are presented in such a way that you can effectively see the picture of what happened and decide for yourself. To me this is what makes biographical history powerful. The prophet Joseph Smith is a powerful character in the history of America and stands next to all the great reformers in religious thinking. You be the judge as to whether this great impact is from heaven or not."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"It must be remembered that RSR is an apologetic book. Yes, it raises some issues from church history that are troublesome to your average TBM, but Bushman gives his take on it to make the truth easier to take. Any real American Historian can see the apologetic interpretations Bushman inserts.So, I am not surprized that some readers have felt their testimonies were strengthened after reading RSR because they were given a framework to accomodate new facts, and now they think they have a better understanding and that they have heard everything.Frankly, I think RSR gives a false sense of security because whenever in the future ex-mo's bring up magic peepstones, polyandry, etc, TBM's will shut off their ears saying, \\"been there, done that\\" when they don't know the half of it. Bushman only raises the issues and never goes deep enough to show why one should really be skeptical of Joseph's claims.I was disappointed with RSR. I was hoping the church had finally ok'ed a real expose. This stuff is so gentle and fluffy, that it is nearly useless. I would recommend Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power by D. Michael Quinn anyday over RSR. Although Quinn somehow still \\"believes\\" in the church even though he was ex'd, his book is not apologetic, nor is it anti; he just tells it like it is (or gets as close as anyone I have ever read).The only positive for Bushman's book is it is easier to get a TBM to read him. I can only hope that some will decide to do their own digging after they read his apologetic-lite version."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As a Mormon I've studied Joseph Smith most of my life. I have always found the church's approach to him puzzling. Almost like it had a hard time fitting him into the Charlton Heston, Cecille B. DeMille mindset of what a \\"prophet\\" should be. I had never heard about how he actually translated the Book of Mormon, not actually reading the plates but looking into a hat. I can live with that. The book is remarkable inspite of Mark Twain's objection. I doubt most of the bitterest critics ever read the work, which is not boring at all. Joseph Smith was remarkable by any measure. People who are offended by his temper, infidelity, poverty, and lack of sophistication--overlook the fact that he was actually interesting,intelligent,and(gasp)openminded. I can't see such a person having much success in reaching the highest echelons of today's PR-sensitive leadership. But who am I to judge. I've always been interesting, intelligent, and openminded. A misfit to be sure."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This biography is not much more than a well-written hagiography which does its best to present Joseph Smith in an imperfect but good-looking light trying to protect his reputation. It ignores significant events that would be of interest to readers. He leaves the Kinderhook Plates out of his chronology, his misdemeanor conviction of 'glass-looking,' his affair with Fanny Alger, his marriage to Lucinda Harris, etc."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Richard Bushman deserves five stars for being among the first actively Mormon academics to write a well-researched, scholarly book regarding Joseph Smith. His book however deserves only one star for lack of moral courage. It is now well documented that Joseph Smith used the power of his ministerial authority for sexual gratification and exploitation. Of the more than thirty girls and women that he \\"married,\\" 1/3rd were teenagers and 1/3rd were already married to other men (something that Bushman acknowledges). When Smith's proposals were resisted, he would often persistently intimidate his victims and their families with spirtual promises and/or curses (not unlike the tactics of Warren Jeffs and Jim Jones). Joseph Smith was many things, but his horrible propensity for sexual abuse overshadows much of the good. Mr. Bushman missed an opportunity to put aside his Mormon sensibilites, to make a statement for what is good and right. He trivializes ministerial abuse by tepidly never drawing moral conclusions about very immoral behavior."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is a biography by a Mormon scholar that pretends to offer a realistic portriat of the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or Mormons) complete with all the flaws, contradictions, and inconsistencies that characterized Smith's life. But it does nothing of the sort. True, there is enough refreshingly candid information in the book to spook even the most devout Mormon, if he or she is unfamiliar with the controversy surrounding Smith's life. But Bushman ultimately whitewashes many of the most troubling aspects of that controversy. His depiction of the First Vision is utterly disingenuous, given a scholar of Bushman's caliber. It is problematic that Smith did not tell a consistent story from the time that the vision allegedly occurred, especially when we are dealing no less with a vision of God and Jesus as distinct beings. Most Mormons find it hard to accept that Smith did not tell a consistent story, although there are no small number of apologists waiting in the wings to soothe their troubled souls. He should have addressed the issue head on. So subtely does he treat the First Vision that one could read his depiction and utterly fail to understand how fundamental it is to the ideological, religious, and institutional foundations of the Mormon Church. His treatment of the Book of Abraham controversy, no less his treatment of the process whereby the Book of Mormon was translated, are equally deplorable. Other instances abound. I came away thinking that Bushman, a professional historian and practicing Mormon, wrote this book to dispell his own doubts about the late, great prophet's claims. He may have satisfied himself but not this reviewer."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As an active LDS scholar, I had heard the hype about \\"Joseph Smith - Rough Stone Rolling\\" by Richard Bushman (whom I have met on several occasions) and had hoped for a balanced, objective look at the the Prophet Joseph. It interesting in some respects - but overall, I found it a disappointment read.My disappointment is based upon the following:1)The book basically concentrates of negative or unflattering first-hand or second-party statements about Joseph Smith - and leaves out the more widely publicized statements praising Smith by believers and non-believers alike. Maybe Bushman felt it unnecessary to include these widely published statements/sources, but if this book is a reader's introduction to Joseph Smith, he or she would receive a highly skewed view of the man. When Bushman does include some statements, he has a tendency to bury the details in the footnotes (at the back of the book, instead of the bottom of the page - making it difficult to reference this information.)2)Bushman, in an apparent attempt to write to the non-Mormon audience, uses language that would imply that Joseph Smith wrote his revelations for self-serving purposes, rather than purportedly received the revelation from God. He uses statements that Joseph in response to a certain issues \\"came up\\" or \\"produced\\" a revelation. It implies that Joseph Smith made it up. A better way to have written it would have been to say that Joseph \\"produced a revelation that he said was from God.\\"3)Because Bushman is attempting to tell Smith's story from these obscure accounts, the basic history of Joseph Smith is disjointed and incomplete. He concentrates more on the aspects of Joseph's flaws than Joseph's accomplishments.4)To say that Bushman wrote this book for the Mormon audience is laughable. I found little inspiring about the book and makes we wonder about the true beliefs and agenda of the author.I would only recommend this book to those LDS members who have a well-balanced knowledge of the Prophet Joseph. It should not be given out as a missionary tool or to those members with weak faith. Non-members should understand that this book is an attempt to fill in the gaps in Joseph Smith's history and does not tell his entire story.On the plus side, the production of the book is nice and the cover is well-designed."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I have read biographies, journals, letters, and diaries which give an insight into one of the most interesting men in American history. There are a finite number of facts about the Mormon prophet, and what fascinates me is what becomes of those facts. No author includes them all. No author gives them all the same importance. So, it is interesting to see what facts disappear, what facts receive positive emphasis, and what facts spin away until they morph into something else.Our author does all of these things. He is writing from an LDS perspective, and so he gives the reader an LDS result. Here is an example of what he lelaves out. He does not talk about the weight of the golden plates, which Smith supposedly retrieved from what was then Robinson Hill but is now Hill Cumorah. Martin Harris, the rich farmer who served for a while as Smith's scribe and who paid for the publishing of the book, lifted the plates, guessed that they weighed from forty to fifty pounds, and pronounced them gold or lead. Other people also lifted the plates, among them at least three women, including Smith's wife Emma, when she was dusting the table. Unfortunately, a stack full of gold plates of the dimension described by Smith would have weighed 140 pounds! This is not a small detail, and Bushman ignores it completely.He does give the best details I have ever seen about the organization of the church. That might be his key contribution.Bill Taylor"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I've not yet gotten into the book, but am very pleased with the price and the service."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"you'd think a new book after the Brodie book would have alot of new stuff,but if you thought that you'd be thinking wrong.For instance the defection of the witnesses the Whitmers. In the Brodie book,the Whitmer's reason for leaving is presented as because they developed their own properties and wished to live their lives free from interference by Mormon heirarchy. The Whitmers stated that they wished rather to \\"abide by the laws of the land\\",meaning the present United States government as represented by the Constitution.Their choice.They were houndogged and branded apostates by the Mormon church. In the Bushman book,the author somewhat defends Smith's harsh actions implying that the Whitmers were greedy,taking land purchased by Mormons for Mormons and then keeping it privately.It seems in the Bodie book the Whitmers didn't want to pay the morman hierarchy the equivalent of a \\"quitrent\\"but rather sought the American dream of a place of their own,especially seeing as Smith and his hierarchy had declared bankruptcy a few times themselves.I know the book isn't about the Whitmers but even the short paragraphs devoted to this subject are vastly different.It reminds one of the school shop project that was only 1/32 of an inch off when it began. Then by the time the project was finished it was unrecognizable cause that 1/32 was 12 board feet at the end.Bushman however does point out that it would have been possible to subject the Book of Mormon to scholarly exam because the Rosetta stone was found about 10 years before Smith's book. Since Smith claimed it was written in ancient Egyptian,it would have been to Smith's benefit to subject the book to an exam by the Egyptologists familiar with the Rosetta stone. Smith and his cohorts never bothered to contact any the scholars and the book of Mormon mysteriously(or conveniently) disappeared. Also there was little emphasis placed on the editing of the Book of Mormon by Smith's associates,whereas the Brodie book mentions numerous occasions of Smiths' more scholarly affiliates cleaning up his\\"countryisms\\". It makes you wonder how many other cleanings occurred not mentioned.The Brodie book left me with the remembrance of the old adage,\\"Power corrupts,absolute power corrupts absolutely\\",a proverb that applied to Smith.You can't help but assess an economic motive for an undetermined percentage of people following the pronouncements of the prophet from reading the Brodie book.If you're a landless working mechanic or artisan working for starvation wages in any slum in the new or old world and someone offers you land and credit and a chance to better your station,are you going to count their wives or debate theology?Bushman doesn't even mention the vulnerability of these new immigrants to manipulation by the well established LDS hierarchy of the time,that's a terrible ommision for someone purporting to give a new perspective on Smith and his associates. I read Bushman before the Brodie book,that was a mistake,had i read Brodie first I probably wouldn't even had read Rough Stone at all,the book is so convincing I can see why the Mormon church wishes it gone.Then I saw some of the current news about the primitivist Mormon polygamist sects,and it hit me about the Brodie book.It looks like the same show 170 years later only with the benefit of public scrutiny through the media. Even if the leaders in 1840,wanted your wife,could you say no,being as vulnerable as a person was in the frontier areas in the 1840's. Remember the Mormon church offered the immigrant protection,security and work.Like Tennesse Ford says,\\"I owe my soul to the company store\\".In both books the authors acknowledge that Mormon missionaries generally went to areas of skilled labor(but poor) to gain their converts.Poor and unskilled?Now there's a real challenge that only a saint or masochist will tackle.As I finished Bookman's book I said,\\"yes Smith is controversial\\"(but who isn't,a mixture of good and bad). Bushman gives the example of Smith ruining his business by giving away everything without demanding payment. Was this after or before stealing someone else's wife?The Brodie book leaves you little in doubt that Smith was indeed a polygamist,whereas the Bushman says yeah but sort of nay.Not that serial monogamy is any better,but at least it is legal,and doesn't quite stir up the anger as polygamy does. Also since a person had to hand all their resources over when joining the church there would be plenty of new resources.With the Brodie book I said,even if I have only deceived myself,\\"I think I own this Smith guy\\".Rough Stone Rolling is an attempt to clean up some of the myths surrounding Smith,but given some of the prophets' past behaviors i don't think Brodie's conclusions are that far off the mark.If it looks and quacks like a duck it's probably a duck,but it could be a teal!2 stars for trying to downgrade Brodie and missing the mark!!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This shouldn't need to be mentioned but the LDS church throughout it's history has created it's own version of history. Here is another example of a smoothing of the edges and redacting of 'what happened'. The only authorities are coached and reworded over the blur of a couple hundred years. Of course, those involved are no doubt close to the subject and reluctant to discount the going along. In the present we have emails, images, blogs and the like to help determine what happens and people's opinions. Let's just say someone from now slowly invents this story of gold plates. It couldn't work. The time and place Joe Smith came from was ripe for this type of activity. Full of those who wanted to believe and those who perpetuated this behavior. Of course there were doubters but it was all part of the life and times. Tell you what, I found some gold plates. God told me that the people of the earth are misguided and need to be told of the true church. This I'm telling you yea that ye shall be saved the everlasting torment of hell.

When I heard that Richard Bushman was going to release a new biography addressing both sides, I was excited to get a copy. I was not disappointed in the result, and even rewarded with perspectives of the man that I hadn't considered before.Bushman is a known expert on Joseph Smith and has documented his references thoroughly. He directly addresses the most controversial aspects of Joseph's life and lets the reader draw his or her own conclusions on whether they are justified or not. Bushman knows a lot about the time period Smith grew up in and puts Joseph's history in the context of the times, which helps us understand him better. He presents Joseph Smith as a human being with weaknesses to overcome, but also highlights his amazing accomplishments throughout his life.Whether or not you believe Joseph Smith was a prophet, you will come away with more respect for the man. I highly recommend this book to all who want to learn more about the founder of the LDS religion."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This Book is exceptional. I Feel like I really met Joseph Smith Jr, and appreciate much more what he went through. It helps you see him as a person you can identify with. I think it is important to read this book in conjunction with other biographies For example the ones by Joseph's mother and George Q. Cannon. Those three I think give the best biographical overview of Joseph Smith there is. I recommend reading the Unabridged Version of Joseph's Mother's Biography. But this book delves right in and helped me understand the enigmatic parts of Joseph's life it is explained very well and polygamy is treated in depth with clear explanations and quite fairly. The author is Moromon so if you are looking for a book that is fair but not angry this is a good book. Read the forward for more on this subject. I would recommend this book to anyone who really wants to know the details of joseph's life. Some Mormon Biographies of Joseph digress alot into Mormon church history. This Book sticks to Joseph the whole time and gives wonderful insights into the experience in liberty Jail(Other Mormon Biographies follow the saints to Quincy, and then when he gets out he gets back in the story.) I think that the whole story told here is quite wonderful and intriguing. If you really like this book check out books and lectures by Truman G. Madsen."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Bushman does a wonderful job of putting Joseph Smith into the context of his time. He couches Joseph's initial vision in the context of others who had related visions at the time, he shows how Joseph's health law (The Word of Wisdom) was similar to and differed from similar views at the time, and on and on. The book provides marvelous context for Joseph Smith and his work.Bushman documents meticulously, drawing on loads of sources, and it is clear when he moves into giving his own opinions. He does not shy away from recounting some incidents which portray Joseph in an unsaintly light. Bushman is honest about the fact that he is a practicing Mormon, and while that occasionally shines through, the book feels honest to me. One critique is that, for those who have not read many biographies of Joseph Smith (like myself), occasionally Bushman assumes knowledge. However, this only comes up once in a while.This book is much more readable (albeit longer) than Bushman's earlier book on Joseph (Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism), and I am glad to own it as a valuable reference."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book is an excellently written account of who Joseph Smith was. Although the author is LDS, it is obvious that he went through much effort to ensure an objective opinion based on legitimate sources. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to know what kind of man it was who claimed to be the first modern-day prophet."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I just finished reading this book. Years ago I read the author's earlier, shorter work \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism.\\" So I had been anticipating this new book by Richard Bushman. It did not disappoint me. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of Joseph Smith or Mormonism.I'm not a great student of Mormon history, but by all appearances this book is a landmark in Mormon scholarship. It is a lifetime work by a professional scholar and historian (there are 103 pages of footnotes at the end, along with 50 pages of sources cited).As a Mormon, I find this book a welcome antidote to the usual polarized discussions on the topic. Its only apparent agenda is to present, to the best extent possible, the \\"historical facts\\" (whatever that means, exactly). The author does give analysis, but tries to base it on the historical records.As others have said, this book presents Joseph Smith \\"warts and all.\\" The book does not shy away from \\"polygamy\\" or other such difficult topics. Mormons who are not versed in their history will likely find their received notions challenged. In this book's pages we see Joseph stepping down from the pedestal and presenting himself as a man, albeit one who did extraordinary things and made extraordinary prophetic claims.Although the author is apparently a believing Mormon, the presentation is matter-of-fact and fairly detached. The \\"supernatural\\" (what us Mormons would call \\"spiritual\\") dimension is largely absent: visions, angels, miracles, spiritual promptings, etc. are not the focus of this book, although such things are reported when significant.The most significant and challenging notion for me, which is implicitly raised again and again in the book, is the blurring of the line between the words of the God and the words of Joseph Smith. I, like most Mormons, tend to think of Joseph Smith's revelations as being dictated from God and written down verbatim by Joseph. However, this book in its attempt at objectivity presents the ideas and revelations Joseph had as at least partly his own. This will likely make Mormon readers uncomfortable and force them to reevaluate their original notions of how revelation and divine direction work, and of how Joseph's understanding grew over time.Non-Mormons who are not versed in Mormon history may find their own notions challenged. One insight in the book that I had not heard before is the comparison of prejudices against Black slaves and Mormons in the minds and the press of the 19th century. I think a lot of the original conceptions and stereotypes have continued into the modern day.The only fault I find in the book is its prosaic language. This is likely due to the author's attempt to avoid sensationalism. But readers will have to wait for a literary-style narrative that does full justice to the sweep of Mormon history or the amazing and beautiful doctrines that Joseph taught.What non-Mormons will not find in this book (rightly so given its scholarly objective) is full insight into *why* Mormons believe what they do, nor an explanation of the essential and most important doctrines of Mormonism, what Mormons call the saving truths. I would refer readers to the Book of Mormon for this, along with the New Testament.I consider this book a model of Mormon scholarship, of how believing Mormons should approach any subject that relates to their faith: you don't have to abandon your beliefs, but try to analyze the facts available without any agenda. This is not easy, but here in this book we see how it can be done, by a mind trained to such an approach through years as a professional scholar.I for one am grateful to the author for trying to present the facts, without any of the \\"marketing\\" or idealizing that many books by Mormons introduce into discussions of this topic. And I personally felt my convictions strengthened by seeing what Joseph Smith as a mere man accomplished - the more human you make Joseph, the more amazing his accomplishments and his doctrine."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As an active member of the LDS Faith I've often wondered exactly what the Prophet was like. Richard Bushman brightens the dark shadows of the Prophet's life and chips away the rough edges of Joseph's history, which has been viewed and clouded from many different angles. As Bushman states in the prologue, too often people try to protect the image of Joseph in effect almost Deifying him. This has lead to a common misconception that Latter-Day Saints worship Joseph. Through Bushman's abrupt honesty Joseph is honored and the work that he performed is made more miraculous. As one of the most important American and World religious minds it is important to understand how his religious philosophy was created. It is also important to know the man behind the philosophy. Here Joseph's flaws are presented concurrently along side his qualities. Finally we have a glimpse of this Moses-like prophet went through as he grew from poor farm boy to religious giant. Thank you Richard Bushman!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"The beauty of well-structured histories is, they remind us not to look at incidents or facts baldly, but in context. Even documented observations of subject contemporaries need not be taken as evidence, but as mere viewpoints of the time. Otherwise, much of what was written about Lincoln before he was president would lead us to believe he was an oaf. I say this because, whether you are cracking open Rough Stone Rolling as pro-Joseph Smith or anti... or even if you're just leaning a certain way on the fence, please leave all presuppositions at the door. They're not welcome-- not if you want a fair & balanced summary of what the man was all about. Granted, Bushman is Mormon, but when writing this book he obviously shelved his beliefs for the sake of accuracy. Here we get to see Smith with all the warts and foibles a human is allowed to have. His judgement wasn't always on the money and his character not always \\"celestial.\\" Nevertheless, here was a man who influenced more than presidents, statesmen or philosophers, and whose legacy continues to thrive. When the PBS documentary \\"The Mormons\\" aired, I heard the members didn't care for the way some of the talking heads spoke of Smith. Well, I didn't care much for the polished PR Joseph Smith the Mormon church tried to sell over the years, but the man written of in Rough Stone Rolling is one I can buy, even admire. If you care nothing for the church, but love American history, this well-written book will entertain and give you insight into a period we don't hear enough about. And if you are interested about Smith and the Mormons, start with this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"As others have already observed, this is an exceptional biography of Joseph Smith. In terms of depth of research, new insights, and objectivity, Bushman is without peer among Smith biographers. And he is a rarity among Mormon historians-he writes well.Perhaps Bushman's greatest contribution is (as the book's subtitle suggests) his analysis of the cultural, religious and political norms that so profoundly influenced not only Joseph Smith, but his followers and detractors as well. Beliefs, decisions and actions that today seem quizzical, even somewhat bizarre, are easier to comprehend when viewed against the backdrop of the religious turmoil of the early 19th Century and the political and social chaos that characterized the United States in its youth, especially in the territories and the newly-admitted states, such as Missouri and Illinois.While Bushman (who is a practicing Mormon, like myself) makes no attempt to conceal Joseph Smith's missteps, at times his analysis is something less than critical. For example, he leaves open the possibility (p. 541) that libel and nuisance laws may have justified Smith's decision to destroy the Nauvoo Expositor-a position that simply is not legally defensible. And Bushman tends to gloss over the extent to which Joseph Smith's theocratic views of government cannot be reconciled with the U.S. Constitution-a document that, according to Smith's writings, was inspired by God. The simple truth of the matter is that Joseph Smith's personality, during his final months, exhibited a few signs of megalomania and several signs of paranoia (the paranoia is easier to understand and excuse given the threats and persecutions he endured most of his life).Undoubtedly the biggest frustration every reader will have with this book is the same frustration you will experience with any biography of Joseph Smith: there is simply so much about the man we do not know. His failure to keep a journal during his last years, combined with the fact that he resided virtually all of his life on America's frontier where his actions did not receive the scrutiny and attention they might have garnered in Washington or New York, means that there are more questions than there are answers. The Prophet, as noted by Bushman and as paraphrased by Fawn Brodie, once stated: \\"No man knows my history.\\" To which I believe he could have added: \\"... and perhaps I prefer it that way.\\" I suppose this is where faith comes in.In the final analysis, Bushman has made an invaluable contribution to our understanding of this inordinately complex man. For that, he deserves high praise."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I am very grateful to Richard Bushman for this book. Writing about Joseph Smith invites a storm of criticism because skeptics only want him debunked and believers want their faith supported. Each wants their pre-conceived image of who Joseph was to be proven correct. Bushman takes a strong stance that lets the evidence we have speak for itself, preferably as close to Joseph himself and contemporary witnesses as possible, and tell the story of his life to high scholarly standards.For me the book read somewhat sparer than a biography that includes anecdotes as if they are history. Many familiar stories that I learned growing up are simply not here. However, relying as much as possible on contemporary accounts and what Joseph himself wrote or said provides a a biography more consistent in its view of Joseph than the books that either extol him or those that tend to attack him and try to debunk him. For example, the famous Brodie biography seemed to me to want Joseph to be both a genius and a dolt, a highly energetic man yet lazy, a crazed believer and a cynical con man, and on and on with similar contradictions. Bushman achieves a more consistent lens on Joseph, despite the complications of the man and his life. I think this is both a great achievement and a real help in trying to understand Joseph. I mean it as high praise for the book when I say that I think that almost everyone who reads this book thoughtfully will take away a broader and deeper conception of who Joseph Smith was and what he did.Rather than try to recount the book to you I want to share several things that I learned from the book and really value. I could list dozens more, but you can read the book for yourself (which I encourage you to do). Yes, I am a believing member of the LDS Church, but I think the book is intelligent and honest and complete enough to provide interesting and thought provoking material for both the believer and the skeptic and for someone who comes with no knowledge of Joseph at all. Believers will have to consider the complications of the man and his flesh and blood temperament and the misjudgments he made in his life about the people he trusted and some of the actions he took. Skeptics will have to deal with the reality of the man and his achievements. Simply dismissing him as a con man or a crazed visionary will not work because that is not what the actual evidence says. Joseph did not run the Church as the single central figure nor did he turn it into a cult of Joseph Smith.Bushman showed me the power and genius of the organization of the Church and its balancing mechanisms of being flat with a broadly held male priesthood with a hierarchical leadership with doctrine of keys and how the later addition of women in the operation, governing of the Church, and caring of the needs of the Saints strengthened and enriched it. And while Joseph was the President of the Church and its Prophet and Seer he really did let local leadership govern itself according to the principles taught through the revelations. I think Bushman's focus on the development of the organization and its role in preserving the Church and its ongoing growth after Joseph's murder is spot on and helped deepen my appreciation of its dynamism and adaptability.I also like the compromise language Bushman achieved in dealing with the realities of the revelations of Joseph Smith. The author always refers to them as Joseph's revelations. For believers, we accept them as revelations from God through Joseph Smith, but I can see them as \\"Joseph's\\" in that they were given through him. And skeptics who reject anything divine about the revelations can accept that, whatever they are, Joseph spoke them. I also liked learning how many of the revelations were given in the presence of others in meetings, how matter of fact they were, how they were immediately copied and circulated, and how difficult it was to get them collected and printed for a variety of reasons until we finally got them published as the Doctrine and Covenants.Another thing I gained a deeper appreciation of was the utter daring and the monumental nature of building the Kirtland Temple so early in the Church's life. Most Mormon congregations (wards) have around 500 members. Kirtland at the time they were building the temple was growing, but only had around 600 members when the project began. I can't fathom taking on such a project with so few people and for a people living in log structures and less it is even more incredible. Yet they built it in that rugged frontier town. I also thought that Bushman handled the sense of the miraculous around the dedication of the temple very sensitively. I also did not realize that when Joseph and Oliver were receiving the visitation of the Savior, Moses, Elijah, and Elias on the altar of the temple that up to 1,000 members were in the temple on the other side of the curtain.When I was growing up I did not understand clearly how early the Saints arrived in Missouri and how much larger the settlement there was than in Kirtland even though the temple in Kirtland was built and the proposed temple for Zion was not. Bushman also does a good job of giving a clear picture of the dynamics of the persecutions in Missouri and how the growing political power and anti-slavery stance of the Mormons antagonized the locals. The so-called Mormon War is also more critical to the rest of Joseph's life than I had realized.The constant hounding from Missouri and Joseph having to fear for his life from then on was something I had not truly appreciated. I also think Bushman handles the issue of plural marriage as well as it can be handled. And I think I gained a deeper understanding of John C. Bennett's role in the persecution of the Mormons in Illinois than I had before. I think the actual martyrdom is given a little too light a treatment here, but it is well covered material, and as Bushman notes, a great deal of faith promoting stories have accumulated around that event over the years. And I think he was probably wise in not opening up his book to attacks because he debunked someone's favorite story about Joseph's last days. Just laying out what is actually documented from the time is very helpful.Even with all the praise I have given, I could heap a great deal more if I had the space and time. But I do want to share an honest perspective I have of the book. It is superior, truly marvelous, from Joseph's early life through the dedication of the Kirtland Temple. That is the zenith of the book. From that point on, while good, the author himself cites difficulty in getting to Joseph directly after that point because his life and the nature of the work of the Church and the lives of the Saints changed. The rest of the book is not as exquisite. Very good, interesting, and informative, but not quite equal to the previous material. It becomes more of a narrative than it had been probably for the reason Bushman cites.I did find the footnotes and bibliography quite useful. They enriched my reading and sent me on to other reading I found illuminating and will help me in selecting other directions for study for years to come. So, I am especially thankful for the hard work in putting all that material together, as well.This is a monumental work and a treasure. Read it. Evaluate it for yourself no matter your present attitude or judgments of Joseph Smith. You will have a more considered and informed view for having read it.And, I don't know why this is in the paperback section. I bought and read the hardcover of the book.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I skimmed through a friend's paperback version and quickly realized that this book would require much more careful reading and study. I bought the Kindle version and spent 2 months carefully going through it. I honestly do not know how I missed this book when it came out and I'm embarrassed that it took me 7 years to find it.Like most LDS readers and reviewers here, this completely different approach to the Prophet's history throws you off while at the same time sucking you in. What's amazing to me is the way that Bushman tackles head-on the \\"problems\\" and \\"difficulties\\" with LDS history. As my title suggests, Bushman is like a freight train coming through Church history and it is a very welcome middle ground to both the Church version and the anti-Mormon version. As someone who has studied this stuff extensively, there was so much new for me in the book. For example, although I knew about the Zions Camp March, I never had actually learned that the whole expedition was an attempt to take back Jackson County lands by military means.Also present in the book are things that I've wondered but never been able to ask, such as all the different aspects of Joseph's practice of polygamy- including lying to Emma, sex with multiple wives, and marrying women who were already married. Bushman is unflinching and I feel this approach is vital for the internet age. As the \\"Joseph Smith Papers\\" continue to get published giving writers the good sources materials, I expect more of this open kind of historical inquiry to be written. Joseph's bad temper, his trusting of untrustworthy people, and his mismanagement of multiple situations need to be studied alongside his incredible accomplishments and daring.I agree with Bushman, who quotes Yale scholar Harold Bloom, that the King Follet discourse is one of the best sermons ever delivered in America. Bushman has a whole section dedicated to this one discourse, the climax of Joseph's theology and given at a time when so many things were going wrong for Joseph. I also agree with Bushman that it is a mystery why the King Follet discourse has not been canonized by the Church since it is equal to or superior to many of the revelations currently in the Doctrine & Covenants.Fantastic book and I would give it more stars if I could. The only drawback for me was that Bushman starts by describing Joseph's grandparents and parents before he gets to Joseph and this part bored me a little, but is important for putting Joseph in his historical context. Bushman's scholarly credentials are top-notch and LDS readers will be surprised at how the depth of Bushman's understanding of American history gives more meaning to early LDS church history. Although a patriarch and devout LDS member, Bushman is also one of the preeminent scholars of American history and it comes through in the book. I can see this being a huge benefit to non-Mormon readers who want to approach Joseph from a historical perspective than a believers' perspective.If you like this, I highly recommend you also read the author's \\"On the Road with Joseph Smith\\" which is a diary of Bushman's experiences with the book before and after it's release. Also, read Terryl Given's books starting with \\"By the Hand of Mormon\\"."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is the second edition of Richard Bushman's book Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism written 20 years previously. The first half of it is pretty much the same material. The second half of it is new material mostly about the origins of the Book of Mormon. I grew up a Mormon and I like reading history from good authors which are hard to find. Most books written about the church are either the scrubbed clean versions by Mormons or anti-mormon propaganda by nonmormons. Richard Bushman is unbiased and very thorough. He makes note of conflicting accounts and uncertainty about some events. He lays it all out there, the good and the bad. He doesn't offer any of his own opinion. He does a good job of giving you all the information and letting you make up your own mind."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This biography of Joseph Smith is the most objective presentation I have ever read. Bushman is a believing Mormon, but his work presents the views of all the sceptics who explain what they think really happened.It is published, not by the Mormon Church, but by Alfred A. Knopf, the premier publisher of American history. It does present information some Mormon Church leaders would prefer to keep in the background, but the top leadership on the whole have not spoken against it.Bushman expected the book to be appreciated by thoughtful Mormons like me, but he was also hoping it would replace Fawn Brodie's biography as the best biography among non-Mormon scholars. It has had some success in this, but I don't know how much.Joseph Smith founded the Mormon people. Read this book if you are interested in learning more about the man who founded them.You need not read the entire book. There are sections which might interest you more than others. The early visions start on page 35. A description of the Book of Mormon starts on page 84. Polygamous marriage on page 437. The Obituaries section on page 557 is interesting."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"A fabulous book! Great insight to such a beloved and hated man. It's amazing what Joseph accomplished and endured. This book gives an understandable account of the life and character of Joseph, the good, the not so good, and the seemingle strange at times. Best book on the life of Joseph Smith I've read."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"For those interested in Mormonism, this is a great book on the life and times of Joseph Smith. The book gives balanced coverage of his life, including warts and blemishes. Joseph Smith was far from perfect, but his dedication and tenacity in establishing the Mormon faith is a remarkable story. Bushman's style is engaging and also suspenseful, as one follows the high and low periods in the life of Joseph Smith and the early LDS Church. The book gives detailed background on the emergence of the Mormon faith, and the struggles of the early Mormon church to establish itself in various sections of the country. I have enjoyed reading the book very much, and I highly recommend it to interested readers, whether Mormon or members of other religions with an interest in Mormon history."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is by far the most comprehensive text on Joseph Smith, Jr. I have ever come across. Every facet of his life is discussed in great detail, and placed in the perspective of the time. Unique, or questionable actions by this man are placed in the time period to reveal an appropriate interpretion. Common place actions or doctrines that are recongized today are also placed in the proper perspective to truely show the unique qualities of this religious icon.I would recommend that the reader is at least moderately familar with Mormonism and Joseph Smith, but by no means does one need to be a believer to appreciate the writings and critiques of Bushman. This is enlightening material, comprehensivly displayed unlike any other work, that can yeild a fuller appreciation for this character, regardless or creed or personal religious faith.I have attending Christian Symposiums when Bushman has spoken, and have never been impressed, but I cannot deny the power and intellectual thought that is evident in this work. I am convince that no one has a greater understanding of Joseph Smith, the man, within the context of his time."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book is an absolute pleasure to read. It is an astoundingly comprehensive and engaging narrative of one of the--whatever you may think of his extravagant claims(and I reject them emphatically)--one of the most influential figures in American history. Though himself a believer, Bushman does not gloss over Smith's character flaws. Neither, for that matter, did Smith himself, who, though clearly often capricious and petulant, was after a moment's reflection generally quite candid about his own improprieties. Though the narrative is almost entirely strictly chronological, fierce disputes within the congregation over controversial new doctrines consistently arise, and it is in explicating these that Bushman really shines. Bushman copiously cites rhetoric from both sides of the argument and distills the conflict to the core principles at play, those mostly predominant being republicanism vs. theocracy, secular values vs. unsavory church doctrine, and even classic antebellum discourses on state's rights. Bushman's analyses of how Mormon doctrine at times both deviated and buttressed erstwhile prevailing or fashionable theological currents are astonishingly learned and well written. Aside from a few awe-inspired rhetorical flourishes that pepper the text, skeptical readers needn't worry about hagiography or spin; in fact, upon finishing the book, I found myself more astonished than ever that anyone at all gleans divine inspiration or guidance in the teachings and leadership of Smith. Although he did admittedly often function as a compelling visionary, nearly every terrestrial endeavor of his was a spectacular failure, most memorably virtually everything having to do with the Zion settlement in Missouri and his attempt at starting a Mormon bank in Ohio. The composing of The Book of Mormon alone seems to transcend Smith's abilities and remains wanting for a satisfactory explanation(the hypothesis that Smith alone fabricated and composed it stretches credibility; Smith's prose in his diaries is throughout his life extremely unsophisticated), but modern science and scholarship, as well as common sense, completely preclude the notion of divine revelation. Perhaps a secular one is forthcoming.Ultimately, whether you're a devout Mormon, a curious investigator, or an indefatigable skeptic, Bushman's work is an an astounding achievement as a biography of both an individual and a nascent religious movement that has since grown into the largest indigenous American religious institution. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Excellent book. I have read it in its entirety. It tells the story of a human being, with all the foibles and weaknesses that entails, who was learning to lead people in religion.The wise reader will be able to tell this is a far more even-handed and objective study of Smith's background than books such as F. Brodie's \\"No man knows my history\\" and those books with sensational titles that were written more just to get us to buy them than to to present research as objectively as possible.If you want to know the good and negative to Smith's background in tremendous detail (the book is thick), this is the book to read. If you want to read something that supports what you have already concluded, positive or negative, you'll want to choose some other book."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"What makes this biography so remarkable is that it brings together, as best as any printed word can, the currents that formed Joseph Smith s motivations and actions--sometimes down to a weekly, if not daily basis. These currents include many that Joseph Smith would have been fully aware of--his own family s grinding poverty his father s dreams that echo Lehi s dream religious foment on the American frontier folk magic interest in the origins of native Americans as well as many that Bushman suggests Joseph Smith could not have directly known about such as the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg, whose beliefs on gradation of kingdoms in the hereafter sound like the later Mormon construct of the three degrees of glory. Objective persons interested in Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--supporters detractors or neutral--ought to appreciate this great great contribution to understanding a pivotal religious figure. I feel that Bushman treats well the intractable complexity of the Book of Mormon diligently comparing various theories and controversies as to its origins and concluding that the contents of book itself resists any simple explanation as to how it came into being. If you want to be a critic of the Book of Mormon and the Church you will be much better armed after reading Bushman s tour of the Book of Mormon and theories against a divine origin of it. If you are a believing Latter-day Saint or otherwise prepared to give some credence to Joseph s own account of its origins you will likewise find Bushman s analysis highly informative and as I did faith-promoting. This is walking a fine line for an active Mormon--Bushman does it masterfully. Another specific example of Bushman's remarkable analysis is the establishment of the Mormon priesthood--distinguishing Mormonism forever from Protestants by adopting a priesthood structure of authority but equally unlike the Catholic priesthood. Regarding the priesthood, Bushman concludes (p.205 ) \\"The priesthood web prevented Mormons from ever spinning free into isolation with God. Their lives were interwoven with priesthood from the foundations of the earth.\\" The book is not even halfway over at this point. The rest of the book is every bit as good.This book joints my other two favorite books about Joseph Smith, Donna Hill \\"Joseph Smith the First Mormon \\" and Harold Bloom \\"The American Religion.\\" The book expands greatly upon Bushman s much earlier work \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism.\\" Bushman s high stature as a leading historian of colonial American history should lend credence to his methods and analysis.I believe that we all tend to \\"see through a glass darkly\\" about Joseph Smith, or any other sacred history. I think that fair-minded Mormons and non-Mormons alike can exchange enlightening and positive dialogue about this remarkable man. If you've already made up your mind one way or another about Joseph Smith, this book is probably not going to change your opinion. But one thing this book will do is to provide you with very comprehensive body of information and a thoughtful analysis of what made the man Joseph Smith, and what motivated his life-long work. All persons interested in Joseph Smith and Mormons should appreciate this definitive work."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Critique of Joseph Smith: \\"Rough Stone Rolling,\\" by Richard Lyman Bushman:Powerfully persuasive in a concentric examination of the details reflecting upon this modern prophet, Joseph Smith, Richard Bushman pulls upon both Mormon and non-Mormon sources to give a radically unbiased perception of the cultural, political, religious, and social background of the era he examines. For some Mormons his research will no doubt give insights never before carefully examined or given much credence, something to temper their testimony of one of the most remarkable men ever to be born in America. Pulling no punches, but letting the words of Joseph Smith tell much of Smith's own story, Bushman doesn't flinch at giving the Smith's writings the original credence of misspellings, stylistic differences, and paragraphing, items that by LDS historians have been carefully corrected. Wonderfully woven into the text are elemental and primary details, facts, and innuendo, these carefully backed up with multiple endnotes. Bushman, who is a Mormon also, seems devoted strongly to the art of historian of depicting Joseph Smith from multiple angles, letting the cultural forays, the historically well researched details, gathered from both LDS Church and anti-LDS Church materials, show this modern prophet a man, almost mystical in his abilities, filled with a link of some divine means by which Smith was able to combine heaven and earth while fending off the foes of hell. No other work on the Prophet Joseph Smith of the hundreds I have read show with such unabashed honesty the culturally circular notions associated with the backdrop of the times in which Smith lived. Truly, for someone searching for a sense of Joseph Smith and the roots of Mormonism, one comes away from this work with an admiration of Smith and his followers weathering the storm of an undisciplined and yet to be discovered constitutional America. The work is surely deserving of a 10. David Dickson"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This is a great book that covers the rise of Mormonism - it does not hold back and explores all of the \\"negative\\" aspects of the life of Joseph Smith.

I would shop with them again!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"There is no question that Bushman has done the hard work of researching the life of Joseph Smith. Having read gobs of biographical material on the man, I still learned some important insights about in this book, and more importantly, about the change in \\"vision\\" the modern church has 200 years later with regard to their founding prophet and his teachings. Make no mistake--this is a good book, and I recommend it often.But there is a side to this book that warrants discussion, and I hope it gets it here.This book serves the church's agenda. With the advent of the internet, information about Joseph Smith is more readily available than ever before, and members of the church can find all manner of unsavory tidbits by simply Googling \\"Joseph Smith\\" as they sit down to prepare their Priesthood lesson. Translating with his face in a hat, with the peepstone in the bottom; a penchant for folk magic and treasure seeking; the questionable evolution of polygamy and in particular, the Fanny Alger \\"afair\\"; the REAL vision of Zion; the debacle of Zion's Camp. And so on.The church can no longer keep the \\"not-so-faithful\\" history from it's members, and so they were faced with a dilema. How do we acknowledge the reality of Smith's life, without undermining the testimony of countless members of the church? The solution? Ask Richard Bushman to write this book, and provide not only the validation of those \\"unsavory tidbits\\", but follow them up with enough spin that it leaves the members satisfied that, although things are not as they thought they were, they are still okay.That's called inoculation. You expose them to a modified version of the virus, which might make them uncomfortable, but it won't kill them. And once they get over it, then nothing they read on the internet or anywhere else will again damage their testimony.I have written elsewhere on the internet page after page after page, highlighting the spin of Rough Stone Rolling, but I'll cite here a single, glaring example. In Chapter 3: Translation, Bushman says, \\"After 1828, Joseph could no longer see that magic might have prepared him to believe in a revelation of gold plates and translation with a stone. It did not occur to him that without magic his family might have scoffed at his story of Moroni, as did the minister who rejected the First Vision. Magic had played its part and now could be cast aside.\\" He goes on to describe folk magic as a \\"prepatory gospel\\", without which, the REAL gospel could not have come forth.Are you KIDDING ME!?I am familiar with the phrase, \\"God works in mysterious ways,\\" but Bushman is suggesting that God works with the occult to prepare His prophets, because otherwise, God Himself is not going to be convincing enough when He taps his boy, Joe, on the shoulder and says, \\"Hey, I have gold plates.\\"But if the membership is prepared to believe that folk magic is a \\"prepatory gospel,\\" then they no longer have to worry their \\"pretty little heads\\" about Joseph's money digging, or the use of peep stones.The book is replete with examples such as this, excusing away the many versions of the First Vision, the obvious conundrum with the Book of Abraham having been derived from a common funerary papyrus, the scandals of Fanny Alger and the Kirtland Anti-Banking Society, etc. So, while it is meticulously researched on the one hand, be very aware that Bushman provides an \\"interpretation\\" that is couched in that research and makes it sound like it is sound reasoning supported by the tenets of the church.It's not. It's spin.Okay. Now, I know how these reviews work, so feel free to shred this and mark it \\"Unhelpful\\" because I know many who have come here to find out about this book are not going to care for this review. I suspect it will be relegated quickly to dustbin of \\"unhelpful\\" reviews. But I suggest it MIGHT be more helpful to discuss this, rather than just trash me."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I have just finished reading Rough Stone Rolling, and shall miss my evenings visiting the world of Joseph Smith. This is an easy and excellent read.I joined the Mormon Church almost 40 years ago, when the missionaries (and their bosses and handlers) certainly would not have told you a good deal of what Richard Lyman Bushman does. In fact, I rather doubt that the missionaries knew anything of this. If I had come across Bushman's story of the Mormon Prophet, had read this book back in the early 1970s, I'd not have joined the LDS Church.There are two ways of looking at Bushman's story. First, that Joseph Smith was visited by angels and resurrected characters from the Bible, and that he translated the Book of Mormon from real golden plates all on his own. He followed that up with the books of Moses and Abraham, and regular revelations. Or one could read between the lines of Bushman's narrative and appreciate that there is abundant evidence that Joseph Smith created the Book of Mormon by fronting for Sidney Rigdon. Rigdon had been out to publish an \\"American Bible\\" before the Mormon experience. It is nearly always Rigdon leading meetings and leading the Church. He broke with Joseph Smith over Smith's attempted seduction of (Rigdon's) young daughter. Smith clearly had \\"lost the plot\\" several years before his death and had become an embarrassment to many of the early leaders of the Mormon Church, leading many to abandon the enterprise. Rigdon formed a \\"Mormon sect\\" after Smith's death, in a way one might expect from someone who had lead Smith rather than followed him. Curious.I would encourage readers of Rough Stone Rolling to look at it with an open mind. Do not start by assuming Joseph Smith was a true prophet, rather, consider the evidence as you finish the book and decide whether it reveals a man of God, or a mere man of his times with awfully unhealthy appetites.Do read the book!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Mr. Bushman, a Mormon, is not afraid to show the real Joseph Smith, the one who makes mistakes; the one who doesn't always succeed, the one who had financial troubles; who's family was poor and did not always succeed in their ventures; yet also the Joseph Smith who started a new religion; who founded new cities and built two temples. Joseph Smith is not a simple man, and Mr. Bushman treats him as he is, a human being, yet one who God called as a prophet. Mr. Bushman treats very well the sections on the groundbreaking revelations regarding the nature of God and the nature of man. It really shows just how much was lost over the 2 millenia since the time of the Savior.A recommended read for any Mormon, and for anybody else who is curious about Joseph Smith and wants a real look at the man."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"The book was in fair condition and arrived promptly.

His treatment is sure to be accepted by Mormons and non-Mormons alike as being an objective, fair and honest appraisal of the history of Joseph Smith. I would recommend this book as a very fine biography of, as it has been said, the most influential American of the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Dr. Richard Bushman is to be commended for writing one of the best, most balanced biographies of perhaps the most controversial man in American history. The fact that Mormon Mullahs and rabidly hateful Mormon detractors both dislike this book sez something good. Dr. Bushman's work is as objective as possible without the polemics, charactor assassinations, deifications, etc. that are found in other works. For this, Dr. Bushman deserves 5 stars and the congratulations of all open minded persons.I started reading history at quite an early age, and Mormon history was always one of my topics of fascination. I remember Joseph Fielding Smith, as Church Historian, wrote a book entitled \\"Essentials In Church History\\", and other titles as well. I was surprised, even as a newly returned missionary, at the excessively defensive posture taken in these earlier books. Further, I have read more controversial books from the Mormon perspective, including the hate pieces written by Sandra and Gerald Tanner, as well as the disingenuous Brodie. None of these rang of truth or were very satisfying. This book does ring of truth largely because Dr. Bushman presents the cold hard facts and lets the reader come to his/her own conslusions.Dr. Bushman does not confuse Smith family history with Church history, one of the bigger mistakes made in previous Church sponsored works--particularly as late as the 1970s. Church Historians often were members of the Smith family. Dr. Bushman professionally steps back and looks at Joseph Smith as a man, which to me makes him much more remarkable than a person to be deified.This book has much to make Mormon Mullahs uncomfortable. Certainly, Joseph Smith Senior's inability to provide for the family because of drunkeness answers many questions not previously answered, let alone addressed. The folk magic episodes, the temper, the plural wives, etc, are not ignored. For that reason, I wonder how some Mormon critics reviewing this book can honestly charge that Dr. Bushman is sweeping controversial matters under the rug. Unless they are reading documents produced by Mark Hoffman, I don't think there is any controversy regarding Joseph Smith that Dr. Bushman doesn't address in a forthright and honest manner. If there is, they should articulate such things instead of only alluding to the \\"whitewash\\" by Dr. Bushman.During the 1940's, Fawn Brodie was given access to Church Archives by the Church hierarchy because she represented she would be writing a faithful biography of Joseph Smith. Instead, she made her fame and fortune at Joseph's expense by denouncing him as a sex addict and charlatan/fraud. She used very questionable/flimsy material to support these conclusions...she frankly was quite leading and dishonest in her conclusions. Later, it was no surprise that Brodie was slammed by fellow historians who previously had applauded her assasination of Joseph Smith when she tried the same tactics on Thomas Jefferson.I would recommend this book to anyone for the integrity of Dr. Bushman's writings, warts and all. Best of all, the reader doesn't feel manipulated as one does after reading Brodie's book."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I would vehemently disagree with those reviewers who claim Bushman is doing P.R. for the Mormon Church. If so, his P.R. is terribly ineffective, as it often discusses elements of Joseph's personality that are less-than-saintly.And as far as the first vision goes, Bushman says nothing to contradict the 1832 record as it was recorded by Joseph. He makes clear that Joseph referred to only one personage in the first account. I do not know where the previous reviewer found his information.As to the Book of Mormon, Bushman claims that the Book of Mormon's purpose was not to explore American Indians' origins. If so, Bushman notes, it does a terrible job of it, constantly diverting attention away from the topic by discussing Christian principles and prophecies. Bushman details exactly how the Book of Mormon fails to represent the traditional New England paradigm of Indian culture (p. 96-97). As to the introduction to the Book of Mormon, that was not in existence during Joseph's lifetime nor is it now a part of the cannonized text, rendering the 1981 statement irrelevant to Bushman's work (not to mention, the assumption that the Governeur Morris professor of American History would pull off a bald-faced deception about the Book of Mormon's origin is too laughable for words)Concerning the Garden of Eden, Bushman explicitly discusses the origin of the belief that the Garden was in or around Daviess County, noting that a certain area was \\"named by the Lord \\"Adam-ondi-Ahman,\\" meaning \\"the place where Adam dwelt, presumably after his expulsion from the Garden\\" (345). While Bushman does not delve into the archaeological soundness of such a belief, this is understandable as Bushman is not seeking to write an archaeological critique but to \\"recover the world of a prophet.\\"Furthermore, it is perfectly consistent within Joseph's worldview to view polygamy as a saving virtue. Even in section 132, the \\"polygamy revelation,\\" it begins with an allusion to Abraham's sacrifice and how it was accounted to him for righteousness, implying that polygamy fell under a similar category (v. 32, 36). Bushman highlights this well with his use of Lucy Walker's autobiography. Calling it the \\"standard pattern for the celstial marriage narratives written in Utah\\" (hence, two or three decades after the fact), Bushman details Lucy's anguish at first hearing the doctrine, with her crying \\"oh let this bitter cup pass.\\" Finally, Lucy proclaims: \\"It was not a love matter, but simply the giving up of myself as a sacrifice to establish that grand glorious principle that God had revealed to the world.\\" The saving power did not come in the sealing to Joseph, but in Lucy's willingness to submit herself to what she believed was the grand purposes of God.Brilliantly walking the line between critical analysis and mudslinging, Bushman takes on the colossal task of actually trying to determine how Joseph thought about his own work. As Bushman once noted in an interview, his Joseph is far more vulnerable than the \\"charismatic charlatan\\" paradigm that has dominated non-Mormon scholars' view of Joseph for decades."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Great book, very comprehensive, almost don't need any other book about Joseph Smith biography!"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This has been one of the hardest reviews I've done to date. This book (as shown by other reviews below) has the potential to bother any reader - both faithful LDS members and also those who believe Joseph Smith was a fraud. Why? Because it contains statements that go somewhat against traditional \\"sanitised\\" teachings by the Church, and yet also avoids or only touches lightly on topics non-believers would consider essential in telling - which proves you cannot write a book like this and please everyone.(No book can tell you whether or not Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God. That's not the intent of this book, and hence neither should it be the purpose of any review - this is a review of the book, not beliefs.)Upfront, I consider this to be an excellent piece of work, one of the best to date, but I cannot honestly call it a definitive tome on Joseph Smith. While impressive and well documented, it contains gaps in Joseph Smith's history, which are documented in other works, that I felt could have been included. I also found Bushman's style of writing and commentary a little too wordy and philosophical at times.Before reading \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" I had read Bushman's previous effort on Joseph Smith: \\"Beginnings of Mormonism\\" - an excellent historical account. So understandably I was expecting the same ease of reading from this book plus much more - especially as both believers and non-believers were giving it such great reviews. The subtitle clarifies why my high expectations were too unrealistic. This is a CULTURAL biography and so as a result, Bushman spends a lot of time interjecting psychoanalysis rather than just reporting historical detail. This is not a bad thing, but not what I was expecting.I applaud Bushman, who upfront admits he's a believer, for being able to present the material objectively. Bushman uses a myriad of sources to back up his statements and has produced an impressive footnote section taking up over 100 pages at the back of the book.However, in regards to historical details of a controversial nature, he will often only touch on the topic, or instead, boldly comment on it with the meat of his point found only in the footnote section. There are also times when he completely avoids calling a spade a spade: \\"To safeguard his burdensome secret, Joseph publicly and repeatedly denied he was advocating polygamy\\". Any non-Mormon writer would simply have stated \\"Joseph Smith repeatedly lied in public when accused that polygamy was being practised\\". (p.491, similarly p.538)Let me emphasize that this is the worst I can say about this book. While not meeting MY expectations it should impress any reader.There are reasons that believers and non-believers will love this book and reasons (as you'll read in other reviews) that both parties will find fault with this book. Regardless of what you believe, Bushman has done a commendable job performing exhaustive research and producing an excellent biography which I highly recommend.***** 4.5 stars"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"At a recent Mormon Historical Association meeting, Richard Bushman was chided by one non-Mormon scholar for \\"bearing his testimony\\" in the preface of this volume and continuing to bear it until the conclusion of the work. On the other hand, some conservative Mormons at the opposite end of the spectrum have found Bushman's approach to undermine faith. Just as with any work of history, readers bring to this their own ideas of what the history actually was--and how history should be told--and will determine whether Bushman's volume stands or falls on that subjective basis, though many will foolishly claim to be \\"objective\\" in their analysis.While I do not pretend to be objective, I think there is much value for any serious student of early Mormonism to find in this volume. Two of Bushman's major contributions are his analyses of the Book of Mormon and the other works of Mormon scripture brought forth by Joseph Smith (valuable whether or not the reader is a believer) and his drawing of parallels between Joseph Smith's teachings and the teachings of other major religious innovators of that time and other times. The former is very welcome because of the lack of serious literary analysis of these works by scholars, while the latter puts Joseph Smith in the realm of other serious reformers and takes him out of the \\"charlatan\\" pigeon hole, though it also can support environmental explanations for the origins of Mormon theology.I personally also enjoyed reading a serious review of Joseph Smith's life simply for the sake of its rich historical detail. No apologetic full biography of Joseph Smith--of which Bushman's volume may said to be one--has been anywhere near this detailed in scholarship, while on the other hand, no anti-Mormon or skeptical biography of Joseph Smith has been able to tell the known historical details without a focus on trying to undermine Joseph Smith's spiritual claims.In Rough Stone Rolling, Joseph Smith and his supporters come alive. They are neither sinless and infallible--though some nonbelievers will think Bushman did not go far enough in pointing out flaws--nor a band of unprincipled charlatans--though some believers may object to any discussion of Joseph Smith's temper and other human qualities. I personally was emotionally moved by tracking the many adversities Joseph Smith and his family faced--the many deaths of children; the religious persecutions; the poverty and frequent moves and the Smiths' kindness to others, all of which meant that the family seldom lived in their own home (or, when they did have their own home, without also having family members or boarders living with them)--at a level of detail that brings the third dimension to the suffering. For instance, after Joseph Smith is tarred and feathered and after adopted infant Joseph (Murdock Smith) dies in late March 1832, Joseph Smith within days departs on a preplanned mission to Missouri, some 900 miles away, leaving Emma, who was no doubt in fear of her safety at that point, to board with relative strangers in Kirtland. There are connections here and details that could be gotten by the careful student from reading original sources or other histories, but Bushman's mining and presentation of the sources makes finding such connections easier and his work is full of them.I also enjoyed how Bushman pointed out Joseph Smith's typical \\"alacrity\\" in responding to what he believed were commandments and revelations of God. We see this in, inter alia, his move to Ohio, the establishment of a site for the latter-day city of Zion in Missouri, the building of massive and expensive temples, and the sending forth of hundreds of missionaries, all of which were undertaken by a highly impoverished band of believers. Believer or no, one has to be impressed with the ambition and courage of Joseph Smith and his followers to try to live what they believed were commandments of God.This work will undoubtedly become the definitive biography of Joseph Smith for the majority of the scholarly community for the next 20 years or so."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to know more about Joseph Smith. I wanted to know why Mormons enthusiastically attest to their faith in him as a prophet of God. I'd done a little internet research but was frustrated by all the \\"noise\\" i.e. expressions of feeling, positive or negative, rather than fact.I learned of two books regarded seriously as historical: Bushman's Rough Stone Rolling and Fawn Brodie's No Man Know My History. Reviews say notwithstanding that both are good factual historical works both are biased: Fawn Brodie is apparently against Joseph Smith and Bushman is for Joseph Smith (Bushman is a Mormon). I haven't read Fawn Brodie's book yet and am still considering whether to or not.In Rough Stone Rolling Bushman is open about his bias. Page after page Bushman puts a spin of events in Joseph Smith's life that, despite controversy, leaves the reader thinking Joseph Smith could really be a prophet of God anyway. For example Bushman explains how Joseph as an adolescent and young man used his \\"gift\\" to try to find buried treasure. Joseph is portrayed as having a desire for wealth (owing to his family's indigent circumstances), but that this irreverent desire had to be overcome before God would allow Joseph Smith to become a prophet.In the end the reader is left to decide for themselves whether they believe Joseph Smith really did the work of God or not. I liked wondering whether it is true. I am glad I read this book. I believe I have gained a better understanding of the human condition. I recommend this book to anyone for or against Mormonism if they want more than just noise, i.e. if they want the truth."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I found Richard Lyman Bushman's biography on Joseph Smith to be pretty refreshing as well as informative book on the life and times of this person who founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The book appears to be well researched and well written. It pretty clear that the author have a great command of his subject matter and he writes with certain authority.This biography provides a very balanced account of Joseph Smith's life, a life which seem all too human in nature and in actions. From this book, I believed that the greatest accomplishment Joseph Smith made was not as a Prophet or founder of an inspired religious faith but organizing, preparing and laying the foundation for that faith that could even withstand his own personal short-comings and those of his own decisions. The author proves to be correct when he pointed out that it was the complex organization that Joseph Smith created which enabled the Latter-Day Saints to rise above the common sects of its times and at the same time, gave the Church amazing recuperative powers.Joseph Smith in this book is definitely not a divine or holy man that many Mormons like to ideally paints him to be. In this book, his strengths as well as his short coming were clearly painted out, some times quite elegantly, other times with great pain. The author is a practicing Mormon so he accepts Joseph Smith's words and claims on how LDS got started. There is no doubt of the author's sincere belief that everything Joseph Smith stated, did happened. But the book also reflect that if Joseph Smith was LDS' founder, mover and ultimate inspiration, he was also LDS' own worst enemy. Many of his decisions were deeply flawed by author's own accounts and his human faults were in some cases, deeply embarassing.The author uses Fawn Brodie's No Man Knows My History as a comparsion work in his own book. Brodie's accounts was considered by many scholars (probably non-LDS) as most complete and best detail book. Unfortunately, Brodie, a former Mormon, wrote a book that decried Joseph Smith's Church as an ultimate fraud.This book may troubled some Mormons who continued to think Joseph Smith as perfect prophet of God. The author take great pains to belied that fantasy. But the imperfect prophet that emerged from these pages proves to just another man, trying his best within his limitations to do the best he can in the world he lives in. At least, Bushman was successful in pointing that out throughout the book.Not being a Mormon myself, I still thought that Bushman's book proves to be a very honest and detail biography on Joseph Smith. I agreed with other reviews that this book may be regarded as the definitive biography on the man."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I applaud Bushman for undertaking such a large task. Writing a detailed biography of anyone is not easy, let alone the biography of a young man who claimed to be God's true prophet here to restore the only true church on the face of the earth. As a Mormon, you would think that Bushman would be biased towards Joseph Smith. Yet, the reader does not get that sense throughout the book. Instead, Bushman, who I have heard speak many times and highly recommend if you have the chance, crafted in \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" a readable, yet detailed account of Joseph's short life. This is an excellent book for someone comfortable and somewhat familiar with Mormons, the LDS church's history, and Joseph Smith. But this is not the book for someone interested in learning more about the basic beliefs of the Mormon/LDS church. Mormons will no doubt be in the media's attention in the near future with Mitt Romney considering a presidential run, and at some point, the country will probably hear that, among all of Joseph's accomplishments, he also had his own presidential run of 1844. Great book Dr. Bushman."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Joseph Smith creates an interesting conundrum, 'a riddle wrapped up in an enigma' to quote Churchill. He stands directly between Mormons and Non-Mormons and sets a hurdle that, to some, is difficult to get over. His name creates either love, hate ,fear or ambivalence depending on which side of the fence your belief is on. In this book, Bushman takes on the task and does an admirable job. Most of the text stays on the trunk of Joseph's life and wisely doesn't get caught up in the branches...he does the wise biographer approach of reporting both sides of an argument then leaving the decision up to the reader. This work is a reasonably balanced approach and is not your normal Sunday School lesson as there are the good and the controversial(some may take offense). I really enjoyed Bushman's intellectual viewpoints on Joseph's life and culture. As a member of the LDS Church, I was aware of just about all of the controversial information so found no real surprises inside. Bushman brings Joseph's life and culture down to a more relatable level, not by diminishing his mission as prophet, but by making him more human. This is a highly recommended work on a very important man's life. Joseph Smith deserves to be studied..not just his life, but the words and doctrines he revealed.Bushman, who is an active member of the LDS Church, is not completely free of bias or presuppositions but does his best to keep from unbalancing this cultural history. When the gunsmoke settled and Joseph and his brother Hyrum were buried, the interesting facts were that the Church still was standing. One of the aspects Bushman brings out dealt with why the church was able to survive all the adversity. Bushman explains that Joseph delegated much authority to the Council of Fifty and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to 'carry off this work'. It was as much theirs as his and they were entitled to revelation to accomplish their assignments. So when Sidney Rigdon..by this time disaffected and not a member of the council.. tried to take over control of the Church, the Quorum of Twelve were able to step in and re-organize. After choosing Brigham Young as Joseph's successor and getting the sustaining vote of the membership, the Church moved forward.Joseph Smith certainly set in motion something quite remarkable. That is a work designed to revolutionize the world. A work that is certainly controversial and upsetting to the standard Christian's applecart. Bushman's book is not the final say on Joseph Smith but is definitely worth its' place on the historical reference shelf."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"This book allows people to judge Joseph Smith by both his good works and his faults. It is good to see in print that Joseph Smith was a real person and from the posts from Mormon readers, the realization is appreciated by many. Aside from the Mormon bashing that seems to be common on every forum that deals with the LDS Church, this book is a good reference for those wishing to look into the life of a very powerful person in the 19th century. I recommend this book to those who wish a very detailed look into the life of JS but also into how life was lived in those times."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Joseph Smith is without doubt a highly contentious figure. To some he is a prophet; God's voice to this age. To others, he is a charlatan, a deluded visionary, even a demented occultist. For most of us he is associated vaguely with two things: the Book of Mormon and polygamy. As a matter of historical fact, he is responsible for the formation of perhaps the largest religious sect to emerge in modern times.In a tale richly saturated in the atmosphere and unique culture of American settler life, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling brings the reader from the poverty and hardships of Joseph Smith's childhood in New York state, right through to his violent death at the age of 38, by which time he is head of an international religious movement, founder of a significant American city, and presidential candidate.The pathway between these two points is marked with visions of angels and 'revelations' that begin in Joseph's life at the age of 14. These lead to the 'translation' of the Book of Mormon from a set of golden plates whose whereabouts are revealed to him by an angel named Moroni. These strange events catapult Joseph into the limelight, and he begins to steadily attract a band of followers. As persecution from the suspicious locals intensifies, the Mormons move on, firstly to Ohio, then Missouri, finally ending up in Illinois where they establish the city of Nauvoo. Along the way, Mormon doctrine and rituals are developed, almost exclusively by means of 'revelation' through the person of Joseph Smith, culminating in the plurality doctrines--plural marriage and plural gods--which alienated Joseph's wife Emma, and ultimately split the movement.Rough Stone Rolling is an exhaustively researched, compelling tale of an extraordinary life. The author is a believing Mormon, and yet his account reads surprisingly objectively. He clearly has the motivation and insight to explain the intricacies and origins of Mormon belief and practice.Armchair Interviews says: At 567 pages, this book is not for the faint-hearted, but it is absolutely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"For believers, the idea that a believing historian would compare a history of Joseph Smith with **gasp** Fawn Brodie's book, No Man Knows My History, might seem like a sin worth of excommunication. But, the basic premise of No Man Knows My History is that Joseph Smith was a product of the era in which he lived -- nothing more than a charismatic leader whose \\"revelations\\" and \\"priesthood\\" can all be explained by understanding him as a 19th century Yankee. This book seeks to answer Brodie's history by showing the cultural influences on Joseph Smith in what the author hopes is a more balanced, less rabidly anti-Mormon perspective.I've been a little puzzled by some of the reviews of this book -- perhaps they didn't notice the subtitle on the cover of the book: \\"A Cultural Biography of Mormonism's Founder.\\" Rough Stone Rolling is the author's attempt to place Joseph in his century as the founder of a religious movement. The text of the book describes religious movements started during Joseph's time, the socioeconomic forces in the areas where Joseph lived, describes contemporary books and texts Joseph might have had access to, and more all alongside doctrinal commentary and biographical information.So perhaps, potential buyers need a little more information. If you're looking for cute anectdotal stories to share during Seminary lessons, this book isn't for you. On the other hand, if you want to understand Joseph Smith as a 19th century American, this book is for you. If long descriptions of the origins of priesthood organization will make you wanna pull a Fahrenheit 451, don't buy this book. If learning contextual motivations for Joseph's decisions or the evolution of priesthood government toots your horn, you'll love Rough Stone Rolling.This isn't a light read, but it's an easy read. The text is logical, follows a mostly chronological order, and is clearly worded. Personally, I loved it, and this is my first JS history since They Knew the Prophet (though that IS a cute anectdotal story-type book).This text was very helpful in understanding the Smiths as peepstone-looking money-diggers in terms of the religous ferver in thier locale. I am reading the Doctrine and Covenants at the same time as this book, and understanding the motivations and background of the revelations has been helpful. I've also enjoyed learning how revelations were received, and contrasting that method with the translation of the Book of Mormon and other texts. I do agree with the reviewer who said that Bushman's use of the word \\"translation\\" is confusing, but since that's the word Joseph and his contemporaries used to describe what was happening, I can understand why he chose to use it also.Somehow Mormonism seems more rational, less mysterious, through Bushman's eyes, but I didn't feel like describing events surrounding the Prophet in a scholarly manner made them any less miraculous. An excellent read.(If you do buy this book, read it with a finger in the foot notes -- there are some real jewels back there!)"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"A lot of people have started off their reviews with a discussion of their own religious backgrounds. I am a historian reviewing a biography. Judge it for what you will.In 'Rough Stone Rolling', Bushman has done an excellent job in writing popular biography. It is comprehensive and well-researched, but has enough flow that casual readers shouldn't have a difficult time getting through its 550+ pages of text. There is very little to say about the nature of book; it begins with Joseph Smith's grandfather and ends with a brief discussion of the chaos following Joseph and Hyrum's death; a little addendum on Emma and briefly covers the rise of Brigham Young. However, where this book really shines is its general nature to not shy away from the more negative aspects of Joseph's life. For example, Bushman briefly brings up the issues with the Book of Lehi, polygamy and the Kinderhook Plates, and this is what makes the book an excellent biography: it generally does not act as an apologetic work. While certain details are at times omitted or stressed, this book remains a biography and that is what it does: it tells the story of Joseph Smith's life, but provides plenty of details on the characters closest to him, such as Emma Smith and Sidney Rigdon. The other excellent area of this book is its work on the context in which Joseph Smith lived. Bushman talks widely about the various religious ideas in the eastern United States in the 19th c., and this adds greatly to the understanding of Joseph Smith as a person. It also does not attempt psychoanalysis, and firmly concludes that we really can't know what was going on in Joseph's head.If this book has one failing, it is a subtle bias from the first page to the last. While it presents information that wouldn't show up on missionary tracts about Joseph Smith, at no point does this book even consider the idea that he just might not be a prophet. My other criticism is that he is very inconclusive when it comes to Emma Smith's understanding of polygamy. Sure, this is a biography on Joseph, but she was his wife, and polygamy is one of the things that comes into the minds of modern audiences. This is what keeps it from that coveted fifth star. In sum, excellent read, regardless of religious or historical inclination. Should certainly find its way onto the bookshelves of Latter-day Saints and students of American or religious history."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Finally, a book that doesn't shy away from the controversial or troubling parts of Joseph Smith's history, providing reasonable explanations to each and every issue/event brought up by anti-Mormons. An extraordinarily well-research work that is at all times a comprehensive history that has fairness and balance as it's cornerstone."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Bushman's biography on Joseph Smith is extremely long and enlightening. With a close reading, you will get a very clear picture of Smith's evolution of Mormon theology. He preaches sermons regarding certain aspects of theology, then supports it with stories of revelation and scripture. This can be seen from the story of the restoration of the priesthood, the importance that the role of priesthood plays in Mormon theology, and the Book of Abraham. My only criticism is that Bushman does not go deeper on the problematic aspects of Smith's miracle stories. He brushes over the fact that the Book of Abraham papyri were discovered and found to be common Egyptian polytheistic funeral texts from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and makes the abrupt comment that some Mormons have found that troubling. But Bushman is a believing Mormon, with a strong standing in the church, so I can forgive him in this. Other than that, the book offers a great holistic view of the Mormon creator."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I just finished reading this book for the second time, and again, found it very thought-provoking and informative. Mr. Bushman does a good job of presenting in a logical way, all the details of Joseph Smith's life that he was able to thoroughly research. He also does a good job of presenting the information in about as unbiased a way possible for one who believes that Joseph Smith was exactly what he said he was. I am one who likes to know all the details of history, including both the strengths and weaknesses of people who made history. It helps me appreciate them more, and it gives hope to all who struggle to do the right thing in spite of their own weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. Joseph Smith was a good example of one who perservered and never gave up in spite of tremendous obstacles and persecution. He never denied what he believed and never gave up, always getting up again and moving forward with hope after each setback or failure, until the very end.The first time I read it, I checked each footnote, but in the 2nd reading, I found that the narrative flowed better when I skipped referring to the footnotes.I wish that all scholars of history would try to be as unbiased and thorough as Mr. Bushman is. He even does a good job of being unbiased and \\"matter of fact\\" towards the anti-Mormon side of Joseph's Smith's time period. In fact, if more people would make the attempt to understand those with beliefs different than their own, instead of having an \\"attack agenda\\", our society would be much more informed and less bigoted, less fractured and antagonistic across political and religious lines. There would be more understanding and less misrepresentation."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I suppose that everyone who reviews this book has to state if they are LDS or not. Well, I'm not. Still, I'm interested in history and religion, and Bushman's biography is a fascinating read.Two caveats. One, it's long. Two, it's written from an apologetic perspective. The author accepts the premise that Smith was a prophet of God, and one of the most important figures in the history of the world. That said, Bushman includes lots of material that is unflattering in the extreme. The polygamy, the failed businesses, the freemasonry, the political ambitions, the bad spelling...it's all there. I have no idea what it would be like to read this if I had only every been exposed to the LDS church's saintly descriptions of this very flawed man.Perhaps the hardest struggle that Bushman has to address is the centrality of Joseph Smith Jr. to the Mormon church. He keeps trying to say, in effect, \\"It really wasn't about him.\\" But if it wasn't about him, then what was it about? His message? As Bushman makes clear, Smith's message changed from year to year. The Book of Mormon doesn't teach LDS theology, and the distinctive points of LDS doctrine only show up much later and very unevenly. Key concepts like temple rituals and the centrality of the restored priesthood are only gradually \\"unfolded\\" over the course of Smith's short life.Nonetheless, any student of US history should spend some time with this book. Like Smith, it isn't perfect, but it merits study."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Believers and Non Believers alike can gain a comprehensive historical and personal perspective on the life, behavior, and general intentions of the controversial Joseph Smith.You will learn something new in reading this book- about the US, about the man, about people, or perhaps even about yourself.This book details the family background contributing to the rise of Joseph and the political climate sustaining his decline- and everything occurring in between."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Richard Bushman'sJoseph Smith: Rough Stone Rollingsets a new standard for biography of controversial characters.

If you have ever wondered who this Joe Smith is, this book help greatly increase you knowledge of him."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I actually agree with most of the reviewers (four stars). Bushman's book is well-written and the most honest biography about Joseph Smith ever written by a Mormon. It is refreshingly honest about the Smith family and their early years.I would also like to note that as a non-Mormon, I do NOT believe that the LDS Church is a cult, and I don't believe that Mormons worship the devil. Some of the Mormons that I have known have been the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.If you are a Mormon, I also want to say that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. Thank you for taking your time to read it.I noted that \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" is the most honest biography about Joseph Smith ever written by a Mormon. That does not mean, however, that the book is without major flaws. I found several of Bushman's statements impossible to believe. Here they are:1. On page 98, Bushman writes that the Book of Mormon \\"makes Indians the founders of civilization in the New World.\\" I've read the Book of Mormon several times, and I've had a lifelong acquaintance and friendships with Mormons. I have never--as in NEVER--heard this theory. Jews from the Old World came to America and established civilizations. The wild Lamanites (the Indians--called \\"Lamanites\\" all my life) destroyed the white Nephite civilization. Period.Further, every book I ever read on the theme of \\"Archaeology and the Book of Mormon\\" was an attempt to show that people other than the Indians are responsible for New World civilization.I am completely stumped as to why Bushman would say that the Book of Mormon makes the Indians the founders of New World civilization. Perhaps, he wants to make the Book of Mormon compatible with modern science (good luck on that).Bushman's statement is so out-to-lunch that if I were to write this review again, I would give it only one star. (You have to delete a review and repost to change the star rating, which deletes all the comments.)In short, the Book of Mormon stands in stark contrast to the findings of New World archaeology. Consider Robert J. Sharer's heavy 753-page \\"The Ancient Maya.\\" Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, at the University of Pennsylvania.Sharer writes: \\"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World.\\" \\"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration\\" (p. 6).2. On page 95, Bushman says, \\"The question of origins was not a pressing issue for New York's rural population in 1830.\\" This is clearly a misdirection that moves Bushman's readers away from the popular belief that the Indians were descended from the Jews.The Hebrew origins of the American Indians found front-age coverage in 1825 in the speech of Mordecai Noah when he founded \\"A World Refuge for the Jews\\" at \\"Ararat\\" on an island in the Niagara River at Buffalo. (\\"Noah's Ark\\" with Indians aboard sailed the Erie Canal.) I own many books about the Hebrew origins of the American Indians published in Joseph Smith's youth.Noah's arguments for the \\"Hebrew Origin\\" of the Indians came straight from Adair's History of the American Indians (1775). The ceremony at \\"Ararat\\" and speech of Major Noah were carried in all the newspapers of upstate New York, including Palmyra's \\"Wayne Sentinel\\" of November 15, 1825.Bushman adds that no Indian mounds were \\"known in Palmyra or Manchester.\\" On Dec. 11, 1811, De Witt Clinton, Governor of New York, said in a \\"Discourse Delivered Before the New-York Historical Society\\" that near Canadaigua \\"there are three\\" (mounds). \\"In a word, they are scattered all over that country\\" (p. 54).3. Bushman uncritically accepts the false notion that there are facts or ideas in the Book of Mormon that were unknown in Joseph Smith's day--specifically \\"chiasmus,\\" or parallelism in Hebrew poetry (p. 93). Rather than being unknown, these parallelisms in biblical poetry were common knowledge. Thomas Hartwell Horne's book \\"An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures\\" was advertised for sale in Palmyra on the front page of the Wayne Sentinel (April, 6, 13, 20 in 1825).The long ad outlines the entire content of Horne's four-volume work, including \\"the Poetry of the Hebrews and Harmony of the Scriptures.\\" Horne's book is full of diagrams and commentary on Hebrew poetry showing these parallelisms. The diagrams, in fact, serve as examples on how to write parallelisms.These diagrams and commentary are also found in all editions Robert Lowth's \\"Isaiah\\" that have a \\"Preliminary Dissertation\\"(Check WorldCat). They are also found, of course, in Lowth's \\"Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews.\\" Michael Quinn in \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View\\" denounced efforts by FARMS at BYU to hide the existence of such books (p. 504). Considering Bushman's exhaustive research, it must be said that Bushman is familiar with these books (I own original copies published in Joseph Smith's youth).4. Bushman (p. 92) repeats the Mormon myth that there is no archaeological evidence the Huns had horses, so Nephite horses in America could also disappear. False: At excavations (1st and 2nd century BC) of sites of the Hsiung-nu in Russia, bronze plaques have scenes in the \\"Ordos style\\" showing horses (see internet examples).Cortes left his lame horse among the Itza Maya, and they fed it meat, on which diet the poor animal died. The Inca carved a Spanish horse on a gold armband and gave it cloven feet like a llama. When the Plains Indians first saw a horse, they called it a \\"big dog.\\"In short, the New World civilizations did not have horses. Except for pre-historic horses, horse bones, riding artifacts, and art depictions of horses have never been found in the Americas, but they have been found all over the Old World. The Indians didn't kill off Nephite or Spanish horses. Domestication was a key to survival of all barnyard animals. What about Book of Mormon sheep, cattle, oxen, etc? No evidence.In all his examples, Bushman uncritically accepts the much criticized \\"scholarship\\" of Hugh Nibley at BYU. See my reviews of Nibley's books.Lehi in the Desert & the World of the JareditesSince Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the modern worldAn Approach to the Book of Mormon (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 6)Here is a reply I received from a good Mormon about my review of one of Nibley's books.\\"As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate.\\"I would also criticize Bushman for uncritical acceptance of the work of John L. Sorenson. See my review of \\"Echoes and Evidences.\\"Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon5. Finally, Bushman advances the bizarre theory that Joseph Smith's involvement in magic was a \\"prepratory gospel,\\" I believe was the term he used. This idea is just plain weird.In short, while Bushman's book is well written, it repeats the many falsehoods advanced by FARMS at BYU.Your comments--positive or negative-are appreciated. Thanks."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"While this is a book with a bias (there's no such thing as unbiased opinions when it comes to religion or politics) and while Mr. Bushman, dubbed 'the Mormon explainer' is a believer, he examines the religious sect and its cultural influences with an unflinching eye. Whether you're a believer or a skeptic, there's a lot to learn from this book. Fully entrenched members will be forced to look at a history that is largely untaught, and perhaps ask themselves some tough questions, while skeptics should (at least I hope) come to a better understanding of a people and a culture steeped in folklore and misunderstanding. It's an interesting look at the forces that what went into the shaping of this country and the challenges placed upon the constitution during our nation's, and particularly the West's, formative years.

Does someone know of a book written by an LDS (not former LDS) that addresses the convictions going back to New York?"},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"The flaw in this book is that much like the flaw in Robert Remini's books on Andrew Jackson, Richard Bushman likes his subject too much to be cold hearted. As a practicing Mormon his faith's foundation is Joseph Smith as a translator for and prophet of God. So most of the time Bushman takes Joseph Smith at his word and in Bushman's own language refers to his subject as a translator and prophet.Too many others have discussed some of the sins of omission committed by the book for me to waste your time repeating them. However, let me point out that you ignore much of the debate on Joseph Smith if you don't read Bushman's footnotes.I do wish to commend the book for its extensive use and discussion of D Michael Quinn books on early Mormonism. Dr Quinn is a tremendous historian and should be sought out by all interested in the History of the LDS Church. Dr Bushman also uses Dan Vogel's Early Mormon Documents extensively. The 5 volumes, to date, are a invaluable comprehensive inventory of primary documents related to early LDS history."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"Reading Puritans to Yankees, a Bancroft Prize history, I moved to this tome. Professor(full) Bushman is a great American historian. This book follows tradition. One look at Prof. Bushman's on-line student sylabuses or awards at Columbia illustrates his leadership ofhistory students.Years I've spent trying to better understand ancient Pauls revelations; in particular the one with Christ on the road. How can one get closer to Christ without understanding revelation? At the third read of Rough Stone, and lots of redlines, I think this book is about revelation. Also what a rare thing revelation has been; heaven is open modernly for revelation. I wish I could understand the Bible without a guide to communicaton form God. Rough Stone has opened a new understanding of revelation. Maybe the most important thing is that God is all powerful and supreem, and will talk to us when He wants and we are able to understand.Bushman's honest facts include the unknown. Cited notes and end references indicate ratio of 20 to 1, focusing on issues not defense. His knowledge quest is aparent, like an intelligent friend who relates and lays out the reasons for his analysis. The evidence historians rely on, shows that Smith himself spoke and acted consistently with God. All true history I have read has good and bad - same here - the voice is one of personal knowledge. Whether or not you accept Bushman's conclusions on various issues, it is clear that Bushman himself has come historically to his conclusions. Very powerfull statement for an eminent historian.Dissecting a paragraph on prayer, washings and annointings leading up to the 1836 Kirtland Temple dedication is illustrative. After a summary, each person involved is organized into groups (priests, bishops presidents etc.). Concise background connects mental states. Bushman conveys the visions and revelations. Each hammered paragraph a razor sharp sword of truth, accompanied by the Spirit of Christ. May I someday write like this.This book does not attempt reader placement in contextual cultural affinity. The 1840's Latter-day Saints were persecuted, we are not. The Holocost Jews, read pogrom, are culturally atuned, and able to sympathize, we are not. Conveying instructions on getting revelation to unsympathetic readers like us was a challenge beyond comprehenson; study brings some understanding. Bushman has become sympathetic. His out-of-book descriptions of Lincoln defending on the Illinois circuit court clearly depict Bushmans cultural affinity. After three reads, I am becomming sympathetic. My wife calls me a bit crazy with the the 10 mile walks to Church, and baking bread from hand ground wheat, and almost loosing my job from sticking up for \\"no discussions of dating activities by the student interns at work\\". A good book should motivate action - maybe I should be less motivated (so she says).The highest recommendation, this is what I would give this book. I A guide to me, it sits with Bushmans other books and essays. I seem better able to understand conference talks. I listened to N. Eldon Tanners talk on Christ from the 147th conference (1982). He went over the first vision. But it became clear Tanner was talking from personal revelation, relating the 1832 description of Joseph Smith. Characteristics of revelation I learned reading Bushmans book jumped out at me during Tanners' talk."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"One must respect Richard L. Bushman's credentials and track record; he is a very competent historian by any reasonable standard.But some aspects of this biography are reminiscent of why physicians are advised not to perform surgery on their own family, and remind us of the old saying, \\"The lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.\\" Bushman's problem, that is, is that he, as a devotedly active Mormon under scrutiny by his ecclesiastical authorities, is too emotionally and vested-interest involved with his subject to be objective, and he wants what he writes to be acceptable by the General Authorities (their official title) who direct his solidly authoritarian church.The sub-title, Rough Stone Rolling, attempts to project the image of a warts-and-all biography, a biography not affected by the awe that Bushman has for his founding prophet. In real-world fact, though, this is an a-few-warts-and-far-from-all biography that, while ostensibly weighing some pros, cons and nonbeliever jibes and jabs, in the end tips the balance favoring Joseph Smith, while engaging in too much ignoring and under-rug sweeping.In short, we know that Bushman, because of his sterling credentials as a professional historian, flat-out knows better than what he presents in many cases. And there are too many cases to list here, so I will present only four: 1. the first one of the book, 2. one about the Book of Mormon, 3. one about the location of the Garden of Eden, 4. one about Joseph's polygamy.1. Bushman early on states baldly that in about 1820 Joseph Smith had his first vision wherein two physically separate personages appeared, God the Father and Jesus Christ. But there is virtually unanimous agreement among LDS and non-LDS historians that Joseph's first (1832) account (and the only one written in his own hand) of this claimed vision unambiguously states the appearance of just one personage, not two. Bushman, of course, knows that the two-personages claim didn't begin until 1838, 18 years after the claimed event, by which time Smith's theology had changed from the 1830 Book of Mormon's protestant-type, one triune God (Father, Son and Holy Ghost as three aspects of one being), to Smith's later three-totally-separate-beings concept: the Father and Son each with a separate, resurrected physical body, and the Holy Ghost as a \\"personage of spirit.\\" The Book of Mormon was later changed to reflect this, i.e. \\"Jesus Christ, even the Eternal Father\\" in the original 1830 edition was changed to read \\"Jesus Christ, even the Son of the Eternal Father\\" in later editions. The 1838 First Vision version, changing to two physically separate resurrected personages, ever since then has been the official LDS version. Bushman knows all of this in detail but makes his above \\"In about 1820 ...\\" statement as if Smith's original First Vision claim really had been of two personages, not just one.2. Bushman states baldly that the Book of Mormon \\"was not a treatise about the origins of the Indians.\\" That does not square with the official Introduction printed in the Book of Mormon, which even now in 2005 still identifies the darker Book of Mormon people as \\"the Lamanites, who are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.\\"3. Bushman does not comment on the fact that Joseph Smith stated clearly that (a) Adam and the Garden of Eden were in western Missouri, and that (b) Adam and the Garden of Eden were at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers near Assyria and Ethiopia. Bushman does not comment on the glaring contradiction of the Euphrates, Assyria and Ethiopia being located in both the Middle East and across the Atlantic Ocean in western Missouri.4. On Joseph's polygamy, let's quote Bushman: \\"Why would Joseph marry women already married to other men? The only answer seems to be the explanation Joseph gave when he asked a woman for her consent: It would 'ensure your eternal salvation and exaltation, and that of your father's household and all your kindred.'\\" (p.439) What? A woman could save her whole family and that of her father just by marrying Joseph? Manipulation aside, note that Joseph also taught that each person would be rewarded or punished for his/her OWN acts, not for someone else's. So then how could a woman's consent to marry Joseph save her entire family and her father's? That's another glaring contradiction that a scholar of Bushman's rank could not have failed to notice.Bushman's book abounds with stark contradictions like these four. But again, if we are to enjoy what is valid about Bushman's otherwise excellent book, we must be aware of and accommodate to his apologistic bobbings and weavings, understanding why Bushman must do things this way. In short, he is as honest as he can afford to be, and any reader aware of the real history must grant him this leeway without being angered by these contradictions and evasions.The book contains many other similar \\"diplomatic descriptions\\" of matters wherein the actual facts are clear enough, and widely enough known that there is no likelihood that Bushman doesn't know them. If we can allow him leeway in supporting his church where he feels he must, we can enjoy the rest of the outstanding book. My experience has been that all believing authors describing their own religions engage in these same devices.In short, Bushman's generally informative biography is a fascinating description of the rough-and-tumble life of Joseph Smith, who was a rough stone smoothed by his confrontational encounters, and later reworked and polished by the deft diplomacy of sympathetic historians. You will learn a lot of fascinating information about the activities and religious writings of Joseph Smith in this book. He was a phenomenally and multifacetedly gifted person by any measure."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"If you're looking for a great trade press biography of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, you can do no better than this. Bushman's book is well written, engaging, and fairly thorough. However, if you're looking for the definitive scholarly treatment of Joseph Smith, you're out of luck. As is typical of trade press biographies, the emphasis is on the narrative, and thus digressions into the many scholarly debates that surround Joseph Smith and the birth of Mormonism are necessarily truncated. In addition, when these controversies are engaged, there is often a whiff of pro-Mormon bias. For instance, Bushman explains the various accounts of Joseph Smith's first vision by arguing that the vision was sacred, and hence Smith released details bit by bit. This completely sidesteps the fact that the \\"bit by bit\\" elaboration of the first vision story closely mirrors the evolution of the Mormon concept of God--something that scholars have very carefully documented. (See Kurt Widmer's _Mormonism and the Nature of God_)In the end, however, these shortcomings do nothing to diminish the quality of this biography for probably 99 percent of this book's likely readership, be they Mormon or otherwise. And I give Bushman credit for his frank admissions about some of the unsavory aspects of Smith's life, including his polyamorous lifestyle. Good but not great. Basically sound but not definitive. Pro-Mormon, but not obnoxiously so."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"America in the 19th Century was populated by a fantastic array of interesting characters. The ever expanding nation produced a person of notoriety for every need. It was a fascinating time with remarkable people.For religious prominence and audacity in the 19th Century, no one else came close to Joseph Smith. He was, however, a man of his time and place. Though Mormons claim him as the founder of their religion, Smith's Mormonism died in 1890. With the hopes of the faithful dashed by the failure of Christ's return (as predicted by Smith), and with the U.S. Government poised to seize all Church property and destroy the organization, the LDS Church started down the path of respectability by giving up polygamy. The on-going \\"mainstreaming\\" of Mormonism since that time has resulted in cover stories on Newsweek and Time and favorable publicity where scorn formerly abounded.But Smith's connection to modern Mormonism is as tenuous as that of Thomas Jefferson to the current Democratic Party. The list of Smith's now discarded doctrines is extensive. Polygamy, consecration of property, gathering of \\"Zion\\" in Missouri, second anointings, patralineal patriarchs, speaking in tongues, direct visions of heavenly beings, \\"thus saith the Lord\\" pronouncements, the Council of Fifty - to name the most obvious- have all been declared \\"inoperative\\" either specifically or by neglect.Bushman deserves much of the praise given him by other reviewers. He certainly goes farther than most \\"believing scholars\\" in giving us a human Smith. He touches on most of the sensitive subjects regarding Smith that the LDS Church has kept hidden in its historical closet since it moved its base of operations to Salt Lake City. And he has done a great job of putting a positive \\"spin\\" on nearly every one of Smith's flaws. OK, so Smith was a treasurer seeker with a \\"peepstone.\\" So what? How could there be a better background for a prophet? Married to three dozen women, many of whom had then existing husbands? Well, yes, but not for love, of course. He was always true to Emma \\"in his fashion.\\" Temple rituals mirroring Masonic rites? Sure, but Smith had the real goods. His acceptance of Masonry at the very time he introduced the temple ceremony was just another of those marvelous coincidences that proves his prophetic standing.Bushman does, however, jump the track of revisionism from time to time to flog some old mythical horses. How could anyone with so little education write something as complex as the Book of Mormon? He couldn't, therefore he was a prophet. (How could Margaret Mitchell write \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" or Beryl Markham \\"West With the Night?\\") The fact that the Book of Mormon is not very complex, is deadly dull, and has been substantially corrected through numerous re-printings is irrelevant. And, yes, Smith really did predict the Civil War, despite the conclusion of most scholars, including Smith proponents, to the contrary.Occasionally Bushman's terminology is simply disingenuous. While he continually refers to Smith as a \\"translator,\\" he conclusively demonstrates that Smith never translated anything. The plates of the Book of Mormon were either covered with cloth, or hidden in a nearby forest, while he dictated the book's text by burying his face in a hat containing the peepstone. The papyri that Smith said were actually written by Father Abraham (but which have turned out to be only run-of-the-mill Egyptian funeral writings), were not translated in the sense that you or I understand the term. They merely were a catalyst for heavenly pronouncements that were totally unrelated to what is actually on the documents themselves.Regardless of any preconceptions one has of Smith, Bushman has produced something which deserves attention. If nothing else, the book proves that the life of Joseph Smith is like the Bible. There is something there to bolster any point of view. But it leaves the reader wondering what Bushman, or any other intelligent Mormon, really believes. That the Garden of Eden was actually located in Missouri and the remnants of Adam's altar were there for Smith to discover? That a battle involving the death of more than a quarter of a million pre-Columbian people occurred in upstate New York without leaving a trace? That despite DNA evidence to the contrary, Native Americans are Jewish?Modern Mormonism is a family-oriented, conservative religion that appeals to many because it espouses \\"good values.\\" Though never articulated as such, the Mormon God is a grandfatherly white man in a charcoal suit, with a white shirt and gray tie, who votes Republican. Smith's God, by contrast, was right out of the Old Testament - jealous, vengeful, demanding, quixotic- who was not reluctant to send an angel with a sword to force Smith to marry numerous women.Mormons should enjoy Smith for the colorful character he was. They should appreciate that he thoroughly enjoyed the adulation of his followers while constantly testing their credulity. He drank wine up to the day he died, hid from the law, physically assaulted people he didn't like, rejected all criticism, had himself anointed \\"King,\\" and, in the end, got into trouble for believing his own press releases. While Bushman tries to make the case that Smith is as relevant to Mormons today as he was to the Nauvoo Saints, he has, instead, demonstrated that Smith was a man who fully belonged to America's turbulent 19th Century. That's where he should be left."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"One should be sceptical of any book that requires a title and two sub-titles. Whether or not one is a member of the church founded by Joseph Smith, he is a singular and important person in the development of America and its organic life today. A book of apologetic encouragement to accept Joseph Smith's account of his life and experiences would be of little or no use to someone evaluating his assertions and the legitimacy of the impact of this extra-ordinary man. Equally unhelpful is a book, such as the amazingly perenial psycho-biography by Faun Browdy--whose deficiencies as a biographer were laid bare in her attempt on the life of Thomas Jefferson, about whom enough was generally known to enable an easy condemnation of it. A proper biography requires that an author take his or her subject seriously, and as the subject presents himself or herself to the world. Joseph Smith, unique among the founders of a religion in 19th Century America, presented himself as a prophet of God. He made clear and unqualified statements that he had, on more than one occasion, seen and conversed with Jesus Christ and an impressive list of angelic messengers; and who received revelations, now published, from them. He also produced a book (The Book of Mormon, best reviewed in Tyrrel Givens' \\"By The Hand of Mormon\\", Oxford Press) which he did not claim to have written either by himself or under inspiration. Instead, he asserted without qualification that the book was written by ancient prophets about real people, doing real things, at real places, in a distantly ancient world; and that his only contribution was to translate it by God-given instruments. Joseph Smith's presentation of himself is thus either that of a fraud, a prophet, or a pious or delusional fraud. Bushman's book errs in not discharging the fundamental obligation of a biographer to present his subject's importance based upon the subject's life work; adding historical and other contextual information to render the life in three dimensions. Bushman asserts apparently that he is a follower of, and believer in, Joseph Smith's declarations, suggesting an apologetic proselyting tool. The book is anything but that. Instead, Bushman compromises Joseph Smith as he compromises himself: a man who propounds what on the face of it may be implausable; but palatable enough to not be dismissed out of hand as a crook or a crank.This accounts for Bushman's need for two subtitles. The actual title, Joseph Smith, is of course what one would expect of a biography, although it is sparse. The first subtitle is not necessarily enlightening: \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\". That subtitle is either incomprehensible or misleading to potential readers of the book who do not know what it really means. Although not presented as a quotation, it actually is a phrase lifted from a longer statement attributed to Joseph Smith, which, if I have not got it exactly right, is along the lines of: \\"I was a rough stone rolling, until the Lord took me in hand\\".The full sense of the statement, and many others made by Joseph Smith, was the improbability of his assertion that he was a prophet of God, and a frank admission of his insight into his own foibles. The uninitiated will thus not easily understand that the title and first emendation mean: Joseph Smith, who although asserting he was a prophet, was insightful and candid in stating that the assertion was improbable in general, and as applied to him in particular. So far, one is only at the cover, and is at best unelightened and a worst confused about the pivitol issue in any written life of Joseph Smith.The larger problem with the book, and the clearest indication of its failure as a biography, is the second subtitle: \\"A cultural biography of Mormonism's founder.\\" If that is what the book is, then it as irrelevant as \\"A culural biography of Albert Einstein\\", or \\"A cultural biography of Beethoven\\". The centrality of each of those lives, scientific genius, and compositional genius, would be displaced by an attempt to explain the work of either of them in cultural terms. Of course it is interesting to know that Einstein was Jewish, that he once worked in a patent office, and that he left Europe as a result of Nazi anti-semitism, but none of that contributes in any way to an exploration of the sources, genius, and impact of Einstein's work. One does not evaluate the brilliance of either of his theories of relativity by knowing of his ethnic background, that he was a victim of persecution, or his love life; because they do nothing at all to explain it and by trying to make them do so, his contribution to the world is trivialized. Those are the settings for the diamond; they do not assist us as we marvel at the brilliance to the stone that came from the mind of this mild and unassuming man. The culture in which Beethoven lived does through light on why he composed \\"classical\\" music (a tautology if ever there were one) instead of acid rock, or rap; but it does not help us grasp how this musical genious was able to produce works that will doubtless live and be loved forever. If someone's life is worth a biography, it should help us know what he or she did with his or her life that makes it important for us to know about it; the setting is the backdrop, not the explanation. There is an unbridgable gap between \\"A Biography Of A Prophet\\" and a \\"Cultural Biography Of A Religion's Founder\\". One need not like Beethoven's music to write a decent biography of him; nor accept that Joseph Smith was a prophet to write one of him. But one would accept that Beethoven claimed to compose music, and that it isn't explained by his culture; and one should accept that Joseph Smith said he was a prophet, and his culture did not drive him to it.And so to the point: Bushman tries to take a man who makes an assertion that he saw and conversed with Jesus Christ, and received revelation and authority from him, and explain how and why he did that in cultural terms. A proper title for Bushman's unfortunate book would be: \\"Joseph Smith--If You Cut Him Some Slack, He's Not Such A Nut As You Might Think.\\"Bushman, in a remarkable display of self-revelation, wrote \\"On The Road With Joseph Smith\\"; a sort of diary of his experiences in selling his book. That the little book should have been published at all reveals a great deal about Bushman's focus--Bushman--; but is also a promotional piece in which he hints that his book has been praised by high authorities in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is unvarnished name dropping; and appears among tales of Bushman's weekly checking on the number of copies of Rough Stone sold. The relevance of this to the book under review is obvious: the book is not about Joseph Smith (were it, the LDS book buying public would not need enticements); it is about \\"the cultural Joseph Smith\\"; and there are no \\"cultural prophets who actually converse with Jesus Christ\\". That claim stands outside of culture; and transcends time and place. Bushman's book is mired in his own cultural miasma: an effor to accomodate the supernatural with the common place."},{"Title":"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling","review":"I have read one fourth of the book so far.

The problem you may find is that while the first two parts of Kant's 'Groundwork' are not difficult to understand, the third part presents an argument that is hard to follow in detail. Freedom is the crucial concept, but you can end up going around in circles trying to figure out exactly what role it is supposed to be playing in Kant's account of the Categorical Imperative in relation to the actions of the perfectly rational agent or perfectly good will. To understand what's going on there, you really need to turn to this book.

Heim's debut novel, Remember to Blink, suffers from what might best be described as a chronic case of boredom. Taking a cue from his mundane job in computer software maintenance at one of the world's largest computer manufacturers, the unnamed narrator creates for himself an autopilot personality which he uses to handle tedious tasks while a separate, conscious part of his brain can ponder deeper ideas: \\"[...] whatever high concept my mind thinks is the flavor of the month. Things like evolution\\" (19). And evolution is one of the many trains this mind rides throughout the novel's stream-of-consciousness styled rant, presented successfully, as a well crafted novel about a struggle for control and the resulting infinite burden this struggle carries.What might initially seem like a cheap gimmick, the narrator claims early on in a faux forward that he is not an author, and later (but still very early in the novel) that he has done no research, outlining, or preparation, ultimately proves to be a necessary admission. The narrator claims at the top of page 2:\\"Given my mind's tendency to wander, I can't promise chronological continuity. And it may seem like it doesn't make sense. For you, the beloved reader, these disjointed accounts of my life may seem to be rather random. But if you're going to understand, you need to experience it. For me, this lack of continuity is a way of life.\\"This clever device-a therapeutic memoir-allows any inconsistencies and character flaws to be glossed over and forgotten. Fortunately, however, flaws and inconsistencies are few and the story holds together well, presenting itself in such a way that only this straightforward narrative style could justify.Obvious comparisons to the contemporary trend of first-person, nihilistic, stream-of-conscious novels will be made. Unfortunately, the popularity of Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk and its more popular movie adaptation have made it hard to claim the schizophrenic narrator as an original device (RTB's minimalist style and use of jargon-laden rants doesn't help to broaden the distinction). But RTB handles the burden well. By subtly-and more importantly, consciously-creating the autopilot personality Heim's narrator is able to introduce and develop the ulterior personality as an part of himself, rather than attempting to fool the reader into thinking it is a completely separate person.Furthering the success of this distinction Heim transitions seamlessly early in the novel from the autopilot as a concept to the autopilot as a believable and effective character trait. Step back and hear of this novel from a friend and you would understandably doubt this sort of effective execution, but read the damn thing and you'll see that it works.RTB is a theme-driven novel, using the characters' mind-space to explore these themes. Think the way most contemporary literature commentaries tend to do. Any of Palahniuk's earlier works are arguably platforms to express the author's social discontent. Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho is similar in this regard; sacrificing deep character development for social observation. Heim goes this route, exploring the motif of control as a way to steer evolution. But the novel tends to suffer from its own exploration of tedium as the ultimate destructor. Page after page of cleverly twisted phrases designed to appear deep can wear at a reader's mind.The rants can be very insightful-especially toward the end of the novel when the narrator's newly discovered philosophy of Christianity is skillfully incorporated into his already robust set of beliefs-but before the reader really has time to absorb the moments of insight he is shoved into another rant filled with more clever phrases-sometimes logically related; sometimes not. But this is all, as the narrator states early on, a way to \\"[...] figure out how I got here\\" (2). And the patient reader willing to accept this will be greatly rewarded by the satisfying climax and unconventional denouement (hint: when you think you've found a plot hole in chronology, you haven't).Despite a few jarring choices in narrative style, Remember to Blink succeeds as a probing literary novel with a lot to say and the right mouth to say it. One would hope that Jason M. Heim has more to say and won't make us wait long to hear it."},{"Title":"remember to BLINK","review":"\\"Where do I begin?\\"That's not a quandary, that's an opening sentence. To a mystery. To an alternative reality. To a book.remember to BLINK, the first novel by Jason M. Heim is just that, a mystery, an alternative reality, and, after all is said and done with, well, a book.If that seems pretty vague it's because it's supposed to be.This book is a journey within a journey. On one level you have the reality of the narrator, and as the audience you sit in as he makes his tell-all confession to you, about his life as an outcast growing up, his job as an integral part of a cogwheel that could ruin all mankind if he decided to let things take a turn for the worse, and about his relationship with his brother.If this seems like a memoir it's not.As one part of the book reads, \\"Sometimes things aren't as obvious as they seem.\\"The first thing you see after the copyright page is a warning.\\"I am not an author.I am not writing this for you.I am not here to entertain you.\\"But at the same time, don't be fooled.Oh, you will be.

But useful to have on the shelf for further investigation."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"In common with other reviewers ot this book, I have a great collection of books for learning Japanese, and this is simply the best for learning (reading, writing, and remembering) Kanji.Of course, it was of great help that I had already a previous knowledge of the language (vocabulary, grammar, hiragana, katakana, etc.), so I just could focus in learning kanji.The advantages of this book are: 1) there is a constant repetition of the kanji already learned and 2) what is much more important: only kanji that have been dealt with are used in the examples and the reading material (and this feature, believe me, is unique to this book and makes it stand above the rest of the books for learning kanji, where the example sentences use kanji that you do not know how to read or their meaning, rendering these books unusable for the proposed task).So, if you want to avoid for yourself the suffering that others (including myself) have gone through, buy this book and forget about the rest."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"Although there are plenty of mnemonic systems to learn kanji, such as Heisig's &quot;Remembering the Kanji&quot; and Rowley's excellent &quot;Kanji Pict-o-grafix&quot;, this is by far the best way to RETAIN the characters, and to actually read - instead of visually decode them. The examples following each kanji are numerous and include varying levels of formality, and are mixed male and female responses. This makes for excellent cross-study, and further reinforces the varietous ways in which kanji are used in Japanese writing. I would suggest the Heisig or Rowley to supplement this book, as both of those two employ a system which breaks down kanji into its 'radicals', which is very useful for trying to visually decipher new characters, but for sheer drills and practice, this is the only way to go. I am on my second copy of this text, as the first one was totally worn out, which by itself makes quite a strong statement - that didn't even happen to my school-assigned Japanese textbooks!"},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"Of all the Kanji related books I've purchased over the last four years since I began studying Japanese, this book is without question the single, most useful reference I've come across. The Kanji are presented one at a time, with its reading and its meaning, and then example phrases and sentences are given. Most importantly, these Kanji resurface over and over again as you progress through the book, making you learn through repetition. If you're looking for a firm foothold on the slippery slope of learning Kanji, start with this book."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"This is really the best book for learning to read Japanese. The book certainly doesn't teach the grammar. But the Kanji characters are introduced in small chunks at a time and literally drilled into the head by the exercises. The authors have also included the texts in hand-written Japanese which is very useful.I have only one complaint about this book - It does assume a knowledge of the authors' &quot;Beginning Japanese&quot;. Not having read that book, I found the transliteration of the Kanji characters to be quite odd. For example, the authors have used &quot;h&quot; for &quot;f&quot; etc. So, unless a dictionary or teacher is consulted, the student is bound to make mistakes. It may not be fully suited for self-study."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"Having just purchased and started on KANJI FROM THE START I am once again reminded of how lacking so many other kanji books are, and I own quite a few! There is nothing like READING JAPANESE out there. There really should be, and like other reviewers note, why there isn't a volume 2 and 3 etc., is beyond imagination!I enjoy studying RJ but keep my eyes out for other books to get a little variety. Nothing else comes close. I studied Heisig's READING THE KANJI before beginning RJ (with great success, also a must!), hence know all the kanji by keyword meaning. If only the readings could be so easy! Well RJ is definately the biggest help so far.RJ is meant to be studied as a companion text to BEGINNING JAPANESE I&amp;II. These are both excellent books (and audio) and you would NOT be wasting your time studying them either.BUT, as educational as they are... they're not too exciting. To be honest, I don't know how long I would have lasted if I didn't already know most of the material in BJ I&amp;II, good luck with that anyway.So, I am very thankful that I was convinced (by AMAZON.com reveiwers, thank YOU!) to purchase both REMEMBERING THE KANJI and READING JAPANESE. However, having to do over again, I think that RJ is more valuable, at least in the short term. What the hay? Just study them both! They are the only kanji books you will need for a good 6 months. (And I do mean good!)."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"This is a truly excellent resource for learning written Japanese. Great pains were taken to introduce the characters in such a way that they can be used immediately and repeatedly from that point forward. For instance, when beginning with the Katakana characters, rather than teaching the characters in canonical order, it starts with just the two characters \\"su\\" and \\"mi\\", and from those teaches you to write \\"Sue\\", \\"Smith\\", \\"Miss Sue Smith\\", etc. It then quickly builds on these, ensuring at each step that the next small set of characters introduces a large array of new things you can immediately learn to write.Accusations that the material is out-of-date, are not wrong (this is the reason I must give the book four stars rather than five). The book was published in 1976! Much of the kanji is used a little differently, or has been replaced in certain uses by other characters. Of course, most of it is still applicable, and when no newer resources come even close to being as effective, you learn you must make do with information that may be out-of-date--better to have slightly-dated but solid knowledge of the most common uses of several hundred kanji than to continue to struggle to learn your first hundred or so.Note that the author has written a more recently-published set of books,Japanese: The Written Language: Part 1, Volume 1 (Workbook) (Yale Language Series); I have not examined these but I suspect they may correspond to much of the same material, but perhaps more recently-updated. It might be worthwhile to look into those.This book, Reading Japanese, is intended to be used in conjunction with a companion grammar book,Beginning Japanese: Part 1 (Yale Language Series) (Pt. 1). However, if you are already familiar with basic Japanese grammar, you will probably find that you can do without the companion.A note on romanization: you should not be scared off by the fact that it uses \\"si\\" instead of \\"shi\\", or \\"hu\\" instead of \\"fu\\". Many Japanese will romanize similarly, and a serious student of the language will need to become comfortable with systems such as Kun'rei-shiki in addition to the more popular (at least among English speakers) Hepburn romanization system. Recognizing \\"si\\" and \\"shi\\" as the same phoneme with the same pronunciation will help the student become stronger in the language.Weighing in at only 425 kanji, this book will clearly not be enough on its own to give you command of the written language; but it provides a very excellent start. Follow it up with something likeA Japanese Reader: Graded Lessons for Mastering the Written Language (Tuttle Language Library)(another somewhat-dated but excellent book), which covers a much fuller set."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"In all my years of studying Japanese, this is easily the best text I came across. If you are interested in learning how to read the language my advice is very simple: digest this book completely and utterly! The methodology - introducing kanji and then reviewing them periodically - is outstanding. I used this book fully 11 years ago and remember it like it was yesterday!"},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"I have just finished working my way through this entire book with a tutor. It took something like 2 years, but I feel it was probably the best way to learn this material without a formal class and without being in Japan. WHERE IS VOLUME 2? I now know the 425 Kanji in this book (plus quite a few more), but I need a source to learn the 1,500 still to go."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"In the introduction of RJ, the authors mention the fact that RJ is synchronized with Basic Japanese volume 1 (lessons 1-20) and volume 2 (lessons 21-35), e.g., \\"RJ presumes control of BJ 18, RJ 24 of BJ 34 etc.\\".So one should read BJ lessons 1-10 before starting to study RJ.The romaji notation used by the authors in BJ and RJ is not the Hepburn one, and can be a source of errors for a true beginner, The Hepburn system seems more familiar.There is a total absence of furigana characters to assist in Kanji reading. Those characters are helpful in the beginning. Their absence pushes one to double check the pronunciation of the Kanjis.It is not exactly a self teaching guide, no keys to the exercices.About the progressive introduction of Kanjis and their easy and permanent memorization, i am not far enough in the book to tell."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"I have purchased quite a few books for kanji study in the past few years and this is probably the best of them all. I like the way the book only shows you kanji used in sample sentences only after you have learned them, which effectively gets you used to reading kanji pretty often, without the stress of random new kanji. All examples are well presented and easy to absorb. It also shows how the kanji looks as it is typed out as well as written out, which can be a bit different. The flaws of this book, is that it uses somewhat different romaji spellings (like TI for CHI) for pronunciations, and also should use hiragana/katakana or at least offer them as well for readings of kanji.Some people may find the TI/CHI thing a big flaw, but you get used to it after seeing it a few times, and I was able to overlook it especially when everything else of this book is well done. WHY did I buy the other kanji books istead of just sticking with this?... Well, for one, I actually like to see different styles of teaching kanji, but also because (another flaw of this book)it is BIG. It's almost triple the size of other kanji books, so it isnt easily carried around. I used this for home study and toss the other books into my back to study elsewhere."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"I have to agree with everything said above: provided you already have a reasonable grasp of intermediate grammar, this book is the ultimate kanji (and kana) tutor. It's loaded with sample phrases, sentences, and essays, so that all the information you are expected to absorb comes fully contextualized and is made familiar through reading repetition. The sentences are clustered in groups which collectively illustrate and drive home specific grammar points (a great bonus). Best of all, the book follows a strictly cumulative plan, so that only kanji learned in previous chapters are used in example sentences and texts. This is absolutely crucial, and it is the neglect of this point that makes other books like &quot;Kanji Power&quot; practically useless for real reading practice. My only question is the same as these other guys': Where the hell is volume 2?"},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"Between commitments, I have been studying Japanese for about 10 years now and have been looking for a book/way to study kanji for quite some time. If you want to study kanji then this book is beyond compare. I have yet to see any book which approaches this book for quality and thoroughness of learning. Yes, the romaji used is outdated (not the kanji as one reviewer said), and while that is a nuisance it is easily overcome and should not detract anyone who wants to study kanji from buying this book. After finding this book, I now find studying kanji to be something I look forward to."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"This book is wonderful. I'm leaving for Japan in a little over a month, and wanted to revisit some of the more common kanji. This book is better than any of the texts I've ever seen or used. The exercises have been painstakingly designed so that you build up from nothing, gradually through the katakana, then hiragana, and finally into the most frequently used 425 kanji. There are so many exercises that at the end of each chapter you really have a very thorough and solid foundation for the kanji that were taught. Each exercise uses only things that have been previously learnt in the book, and there is a great deal of repetition and variation so that you simply cannot forget what you are learning. The writing is all as it would be in Japan, so unlike other kanji and reading texts, every example is something you might encounter in Japan rather than a strange artificial example that doesn't hold much water. Although some other texts attempt to do this also, none come close to the level of perfection in this book. Even better, the text gives clear examples of how each kanji is pronounced in each situation it's used in. It has an answer key (I believe it is sold separately), but the advantage of how thorough it is is that any kanji you are unsure of you can look up in the back of the book and find out the pronunciation from there. No answer key is therefore really necessary. The first few chapters have all the answers in them so you know what you're expected to do.This book is designed to be used with \\"Beginning Japanese\\" by the same author; however, I have not read that book. This has not been a problem, since even my rusty grammar and vocab has not been challenged by what is used in the book. Any strange constructions or words are conveniently explained in footnotes. Nevertheless, you will not get much out of this book if you either do not have \\"Beginning Japanese\\" or if you have no Japanese language ability. You need some basic grammar and a bit of vocabulary beforehand (maybe somewhere not quite at a JLPT N5 level, for those who are aware of this standard). In short: have some basic Japanese ability or the companion, else this book will not be nearly as overwhelmingly useful as it should be.I'm up to lesson 19 (out of 25) now and so far there have not been any major worries. I did the first 4 chapters (katakana) in one day, the next 4 (hiragana) the next day, and have been doing one kanji chapter every day since then. This means I'll finish the entire book in 19 days, to give you an idea of how quickly you can get through it if you want to. I could go faster but I have a life.The English in the translations is slightly outdated and American, unfortunately - a lot of the place names are rivers and so on in the USA which most people will not be aware of, but that isn't any big deal. Due to the age of the book (1976) it also uses English terms such as \\"Soviet\\" and \\"ni**er\\" (Amazon won't publish this if I put the actual word in), which were appropriate at the time but now just seem odd. Again, these are hardly flaws, since they have nothing to do with Japanese ability (even English texts frequently contain old-fashioned words and place names we don't all know).The romaji used is not the now-standard Hepburn system, but instead is what was fairly standard at the time. \\"Ta chi tsu te to\\" is written \\"ta ti tu te to\\", \\"sa shi su se so\\" is \\"sa si su se so\\", and so on. It doesn't take a genius to figure out, especially since the book explains it for you anyway, and if you aren't used to it, it takes perhaps ten minutes to grow accustomed. Moreover, after the first 8 or 9 chapters, you largely stop using the romaji anyway, so it ceases to be a real feature. Any person who is serious about studying Japanese will encounter such a romaji system in numerous other texts and works, since it is still used today (although not as much), so being comfortable with this older-style romaji is a nice plus. I would suggest having someone help you with pronunciation, but if you use either \\"Beginning Japanese\\" or already have some Japanese ability, then you'll already know how to pronounce things.Overall: this book is exquisite. Any student who wants a rock-solid foundation in hiragana, katakana, and kanji will benefit incredibly. However, be sure that you either have the companion book or some basic ability in Japanese so that you can understand the grammar and vocabulary. The exercises in this book are second to none."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"This is a great book for practicing your Japanese reading. It's not a Japanese 101 book, more 102.This is a bigger, thicker book with tons of reading practice on each page.

Then they can pick up this book and become strong in their reading skill.It's an older book and has a few idiosyncrasies. It uses a weird form of romaji. It calls kanji \\"kanzi.\\" It says the character for shi is pronounced 'si'. But these are minor things that you will easily overlook if you know even just a little Japanese already. It's the Japanese readings that you care about here anyway.There is apparently a Beginning Japanese Part 1 book that is supposed to go with this book, but I can't find that on Amazon.

It uses an outdated romaji system (\\"iti\\" instead of \\"ichi\\"), but worse of all, it doesn't tell you how to properly read each kanji when placed in a compound!

The outdated version is actually just another perpective; the older version of romaji shows you in a clearer way how HA HE HI HO HU(fu) or TA TE TI(chi)TO TU(tsu) are from the same respective kana columns.One still has to learn pronunciation from another source, probably audible."},{"Title":"Reading Japanese (Yale Linguistic Series)","review":"When I first got this book I loved it. It has tons of practice exercised, it uses the kanji you already know, it has a great formula for learning kanji, blah blah blah. But I could never get over the pronunciations, they are so frustrating. I can't tell you how aggravating it is to try and figure out the pronunciation of a kanji when you have to decode the authors pronunciation. And it's not just the \\"ti\\"s being \\"chi\\", it's the \\"tsu\\"s being \\"tu\\"s, and the \\"ji\\"s being \\"zi\\"s, and the lines over the letters and all of this would have been fine if they just gave the kana next to the pronunciation garble. Not to mention the book is 34 years old. I don't want to say this is a bad book because it has a lot of good parts in it but I can't in good conscience give this book a good rating.

She holds a doctorate in herbal medicine and has often worked with various EU legislatures to insure the safety and effectiveness of herbal medicines. Experienced homeopaths will find the wealth of information in her book concise, insightful, and well-organized. Davies covers not only the standard topics such as herb selection, essential oil use, and home remedies, but also touches on such items as massage therapy, breathing techniques, and detoxification.My concern, however, is that the book is marketed to beginners. Novices to homeopathy and natural healing may be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of different topics covered. Or worse, completely turned off to the idea of natural healing as something that is far to complex and time consuming for the average person to effectively handle. While most health-conscious readers with an interest in natural healing can probably handle reading about the benefits of owning a juicer and how to select fruits and vegetables for juicing, Davies discussion of how to properly select seeds for use in a sprouter and on the need to grown your own barley might come across too extreme.Davies also has a tendency to slip into preaching, speaking in absolutely regarding the differences between organic and non-organic foods, the dangers of dairy, and even the toxidity of farm-raised fish. While I personally prefer organic foods, for example, I have yet to see any decisive scientific research confirming the claims Davies makes. She claims \\"eggs are potential causes of diseases like arthritis,\\" that butter \\"is basically rancid and has lots of free radicals,\\" and \\"all meat putrefies in the intestine and strips calcium from the body.\\" And she makes these statements without really offering any resources or references to lend credence to the claims (though most chapters do include related works, they aren't really \\"references\\" in the traditional sense.)Moreover, it is important to note that Davies practices natural healing in Europe. this is important because herbal medicines are both more readily available in most of Europe AND they are regulated to insure quality standards. Again, while this is not an issue to experienced natural healers, it can cause confusion to novices. Davies speaks about getting this or that ingredient as if you can just pick it up at a local store (which she most likely can). But readers in the U.S. often CAN'T get the natural herbs and such easily without searching the internet for a reputable dealer or finding a large natural foods provider in their area. Again, novices can easily become frustrated trying to gather all the ingredients for various home remedies.Also of note is that Davies tends to suggest natural healing should be used before or instead of traditional medicine. While this is a position I agree with wholeheartedly for annoying but otherwise harmless conditions such as dandruff, acne, the common cold, etc, encouraging natural remedies for a stroke victim OVER traditional medicine highly suspect. Again, as many medical practitioners in Europe are also trained in natural healing, or are at least accepting of it and able to work together with the natural healer for an overall health plan, I think this notion poorly serves American readers. It could encourage people to self-diagnose, or try to heal themselves instead of getting early medical attention for potentially serious conditions.Her remedies,however, do seem to be rooted in solid homeopathic research, and do not contradict or bring into question other research I have seen. So for experienced practitioners who are skilled in the difference between what should and should not be done at home, Davies' book is a welcomed addition to the library. Novices, however, should carefully consider whether or not they are ready to attempt some of the more advanced techniques without first consulting their doctors.I wish I could split my rating somehow, as I would rate this book 4 stars for experienced practitioners. But because it is geared toward novices as an introduction to natural healing, I rated only average."},{"Title":"THE BRAMBLE BUSH on Our Law and Its Study","review":"Written over 70 years ago, Bramble Bush is still THE book recommended for students to read just prior to beginning classes or early in their first semester of law school. Be prepared to read passages over again due to the author's 1920's style of sentence composition, but also be prepared for an enjoyable 200 pages of insight into the U.S. system of common law, case /precedence law, and most importantly, advice and guidance for 1L, 2L, and 3L (law) students."},{"Title":"THE BRAMBLE BUSH on Our Law and Its Study","review":"Professor Llewellyn's distinguished collection of lectures is best used nowadays, in my opinion, as a baseline to see what has changed in the legal profession and what has not. Llewellyn's discussion of the case system is a terrific look at the judge's toolbox, but law students today cannot rely on a deep understanding of the case system to become good lawyers -- the proliferation of other forms of law, particularly statutory and administrative law, is too great. On the other hand, Llewellyn's extreme statement of the legal realist position -- still only one competing theory of law when he gave his lectures -- is now the undisputed champion of the legal discipline, and it's fascinating to travel back to a time when the author felt the need to be an apologist for it. The chapters that stand up best, in my opinion, are the ones discussing the dilemma of siding with the powerful after graduation; this is a topic that only becomes more timely as expenses rise and the pressure to join Big Law grows for new law graduates. I would especially recommend this book for casual students of legal history or jurisprudence."},{"Title":"THE BRAMBLE BUSH on Our Law and Its Study","review":"I actually felt myself getting smarter while reading this book. Outside of just covering &quot;technicalities&quot; of studying law, he also offers a fascinating perspective on the study and practice of law in relation to the lawyer's life (money/finc. security as primary motive for entering legal profession.)

Overall, an excellent read, time well spent, and very deserving of the word &quot;classic.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE BRAMBLE BUSH on Our Law and Its Study","review":"Professor Llewellyn's writing style is not easy. It's not an antiquated style, but rather the style of an obviously erudite man whose mind is very active and whose thoughts are not always felicitously expressed. If you've ever sat in a class with a professor you thought brilliant but a little &quot;nutty,&quot; this book will remind you of that professor. Many of his phrases are either obscure or seemingly illogical. My advice is that if you insist on doing a close textual reading of a book, do not read this book. If, however, you are interested in picking up general themes about the study of law and its development from a distinguished--and somewhat obscure--legal mind, then this is the book for you.

My favorite part of this book is when Nancy Kress goes through with the list of traits for your characters: What are their values, what do they look like, what do they fear, what organizations do they affiliate themselves with? This helped me illustrate my characters more.Unlike Orson Scott Card's books which are a conglomeration of paragraphs that lack visual aids, \\"Characters, Emotion and Viewpoint\\" by Nancy Kress has lists for you that are concise and easier for those with learning disabilities to understand.In public speaking presentations, it is important to have visual aids, whether they are charts, graphs, illustrations, lists, or outlines.It's easier for the reader, student, or aspiring writer to learn through this technique of teaching.I have read reviews that recommend to read Orson Scott Card's book regarding this topic on Characters first. I did not find that review to be helpful for I learned that I did not understand anything in Orson Scott Card's book. Therefore, I highly recommend that you read \\"Characters, Emotion and Viewpoint\\" by Nancy Kress and any other Write Great Fiction books first. Every teacher has their own teaching mechanism and techniques, and every learner has their own learning mechanism and techniques.Look through it in the bookstore - see if there are any visuals like charts, outlines, lists, illustrations."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"This is part of the Write Great Fiction series from Writer's Digest. Each book in the series covers one broad aspect of writing fiction, and of course there is some overlap as well.The first part of the book deals with creating and representing characters in your writing. There is advice on all the usual topics: character name, character appearance, character bio, and so on. There's more, too: the pros and cons of using yourself or someone you know as a model for a fictional character, and how to get character ideas from the news or other sources. The differences between main characters, secondary characters, and minor characters are discussed. There are numerous examples of how the details the writer uses to describe a character's clothing, home, speech, and so on contribute to character development.Representing character motivation is covered, along with good advice of how (and how not) to present a character's back story. Portraying emotion is explained well, with an emphasis on the tangible signs of emotion and character behavior.There are two chapters on special character issues: characters in genre fiction and humorous characters.For me, the most valuable part of this book was the discussion of point of view. Kress moves beyond the basic definitions (first person, third person limited, third person omniscient, etc.) to discuss the actual mechanics of making a chosen point of view work consistently. There is an excellent discussion of the concept of distance in third person viewpoint; this brought a lot of my questions and issues about third-person writing into focus. A whole chapter is devoted to multiple viewpoint, and how to navigate them.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to work on making deeper characters or managing the challenges of point of view in their writing. It wasn't as helpful to me personally as Plot and Structure, but that reflects my own level of understanding in the two subject areas."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"I found the Characterization and Viewpoint sections of Kress's book particularly helpful. The Characterization section provides insight into 'showing-not telling' as you develop your characters and present them to your reader. The Viewpoint section looks at this topic in a fresh light, clarifying the overall scheme, as well as providing solid examples."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"I bought a copy of Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint very early into my writing career. I had a story I wanted to tell but no idea how one actually goes about doing it. Certainly, I had left high school with the feeling that I didn't have an artistic bone in my body. The whole Write Great Fiction series came to my rescue.In this title, an author learns through example. The book is full of great tips, backgrounds on rules and why they are so, and examples of poor writing alongside improved versions to illustrate what you can achieve and how.I would recommend these books to anyone who is embarking on a writing career and want straight to the point advice without all the fluff and nonsense that a lot of courses or books offer."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"The toughest concept for me to grasp in writing was the idea of viewpoint.

This book, however, is one of the rarest. It is actually helpful to the writing process. Too often writing exercises are tired and worn. It is hard to imagine creating vibrant prose out of advice like \\"Think about your best friend as a child.\\" What this book does is to encourage you to look beyond yourself and your experiences to develop new ideas. Most writers, I feel, are already introspective. We definitely become so when blocked. Different viewpoints, in my opinion, are what are most helpful in breaking free of the feeling that you are stuck within your own mind.And speaking of viewpoint, if you struggle with it, you will find this book is also quite concise in explaining the differences that POV makes. I tend to do POV instinctively, which means I never bothered to truly understand it. It was very helpful to me to have it clearly explained as a tool for shaping my story. This book is alive with insight into the craft and I think, should you purchase it, it would be kept on the desk rather than shoved onto some dusty bookshelf."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"I am a beginning writer and found this book based on a recommendation by another author. My writing improved tremendously based on the recommendations in this book. I never realized how uninteresting my characters, and description of the events taking place in the story were, until Ms. Kress gave examples of passages that pointed out the details in how dialogue and descriptions could further take the reader on the journal with the characters. I love to read and I thought I knew how to put my thoughts on paper, but Ms. Kress really helped me add an entirely new dimension to my writing.I really can't say enough about how useful this book is, especially to a novice writer.I would recommend it in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"Character, Emotion, and Viewpoint was actually a pretty good book on just those factors. This is part of the Write Great Fiction series, which I've liked fairly well before. While I did not like this as well as Description and Setting, I suspect that this had more to do with that I suck at description, while I'm reasonable with characters, so arguably have less to learn. All the same, I think that Kress did a wonderful job explaining how to portray characters well in prose. Which, incidentally, is pretty tricky. Creating a good character may be easy, but showing them in a way that the reader actually understands your character can be close to impossible.)For instance, she goes into when to use exposition (rarely) in prose describing characters:\\"Guinevere's central tragedy was that she was childless...but she was the one who was left an empty vessel, a shore without a sea. This was what broke her when she came to the age at which her sea must finally dry...It may be one of the explanations of her double love - perhaps she loved Arthur as a father, and Lancelot because of the son she could not have.\\"Before this passage, which occurs three-quarters of the way through the book, we have seen dramatized many of the events White is now theorizing about...Thus we're not listening to White's exposition in a vacuum. We have enough dramatized information to both understand and evaluate his ideas.\\"There's a lot of nuance to this explanation. It isn't \\"exposition is bad\\", it's \\"it's generally bad, but here's where it was done well and why it works.\\" And it's that kind of nuance that shows in creating decent characters, rather than clich&eacute;s.Other sections are handled with similar nuance. Kress breaks down different POVs and explains, \\"First person is inherently an artificial POV because no one recounts long, complicated, or perfectly edited stories, with full dialogue, as if the narrator does not know what happens next...The strength of first person is the voice of your narrator; make yours reflect his personality not only in what he says but how he says it...Unreliable first-person narrators can create great drama as readers discover the gap between what the narrator says and what story events indicate.\\"In addition, Kress goes into different versions of distance in 3rd person POV, from close limited to omniscient. For instance, she explains that a highly distant narrator might work best when \\"Your character is unlikable, very complicated, or so different from most people that you will need to include much exposition. You prefer a standard, even formal writing style...You want the freedom to describe characters and scenes from the outside without filtering...Your prose is interesting enough to compensate for the greater distance.\\" All useful advice.In addition, she seems remarkably realistic about the publishing world. In a comment about how much prose really matters, she notes, \\"If any - or all of these - capture public interest in your book, the truth is that it doesn't matter if your prose is rough. This may be a disheartening truth, but truth it is.\\" I appreciate an author realistic enough to note that writing style is important, but ultimately probably is not the primary factor in determining whether a book is commercially successful.All in all, while this probably is not the best book out there discussing characters and POV, it's solid and offers quite a bit of good advice for most readers. I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you can find it inexpensively."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"As an award-winning author, Nancy Kress has written an absolutely brilliant book on character development in \\"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint\\". Winner of 3 Hugos (congrats!

It's definitely a book I as an avid reader (and author myself, of technical trading articles) wish I'd been able to read 20+ years ago, because she carefully dissects the science of character and story arcs, how to position character references correctly in stories, and all the nuances to create memorable (vs hack) characters.This is a really finely-authored book, one of the very best I've read, by an award-winning writer. Thanks, Nancy - for providing both a role model and a complete \\"writer's workshop in a book\\" here for those of us who are always learning how to improve our writing skills.Very insightful and well-written, this is a superb book for not only all fellow authors, but those of us who are avid readers as well.

It's certainly as important as how you paint the setting to readers."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"Characters, Emotion and Viewpoint is overall quite good, but lacking the 5 star brilliance of James Scott Bell'sPlot & Structure: (Techniques And Exercises For Crafting A Plot That Grips Readers From Start To Finish) (Write Great Fiction), which is the crown jewel in the Write Great Fiction series. For my money, this book and James Scott Bell's Plot and Structure are the only two in the series worth owning.The difference between why this book gets a 4 star review and Bell's a 5 is that his book covers a wider range of information and just seems all-around more useful than this more narrowly focused one by Nancy Kress. I kept finding I wanted more information from each of the three sections than she provided, and that made the transitions between sections rather jarring and disappointing. Like, \\"Oh! We're suddenly moving on and talking about this now, instead? Dang it!\\" Still, there's no denying it's a good, helpful book and definitely one of the better ones out there on the subject. It isn't essential, but it's nice to have.Nancy Kress is easy to read and learn from, but not anywhere near as much fun as someone like James Scott Bell or Raymond Obstfeld.

This book goes a step further and tells you how to do those things and hits the key point of showing emotion.In addition, chapter Eight titled \\"Talking About Emotion -- Dialogue and Thoughts\\" was worth the price of the book alone.Other great topics were \\"Showing Change in Your Characters\\" and \\"Frustration -- The Most Useful Emotion in Fiction.\\"Like the other books in the series, Appendix A recaps the author's critical points. Thus for the impatient reader, jump to this appendix and read what the book is about. For those of us who enjoy the journey of the reading the previous 200+ pages, the appendix is a nice summary.Overall, this felt like the first book that brought all the concepts of characterization into one place and provided me with an easy to follow roadmap to creating, deepening and SHOWING my characters off in my story.My recommended characterization plan:1) Read this book as a guide on how to breath life into your characters and what you are trying to accomplish with your characters. (Characters are not there by accident!)2) Pick up The Marshall Plan of Novel Writing by Evan Marshal or First Draft in 30 Days by Karen Weisner. Both of these books take many of the concepts listed in this book and put them into templates and forms you can fill out to plot your novel3) Write. Write.

Her sequence moves logically from characterization to depicting emotions, finishing with the most complete and intelligent discussion of viewpoint that I have found anywhere. She examines such difficult issues as when to use certain viewpoints and how to make them more effective.

But I can highly recommend the complete series of Write Great Fiction, simply because I cannot think a writer could ask or want for more information on setting, character, plot etc.Plot & Structure: (Techniques And Exercises For Crafting A Plot That Grips Readers From Start To Finish) (Write Great Fiction)Dialogue: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Effective Dialogue (Write Great Fiction)Description & Setting (Write Great Fiction)I read first 'How to write a damn good novel' of James Frey. This is a great synopsis of the craft of writing, and included roughly all that this 'Write Great Fiction' series explores in much more detail.I did not realize that actually much of writing theory is more transparant than it seems. We all read stories that seemed fluent, while others we could not seem to finish. The reasons for this are not mysterious. Many aspects make for good, or bad writing, but where can you find works that elaborate on all of them in a clear manner? This 'Write Great Fiction' series splits this seemingly impossible task in just 4 editions that you can read one by one. This book gives many great tips in a clear and fun to read manner. Apart from the content, what I like especially is the setup of the chapter; at the end there is a recap, and a possibility for doing excersises. At the end of the book there is a quick bulletpoint checklist on all the material covered that you could tear out to hang on the wall. Very handy!Just as the rule in writing often goes: 'show not tell', so does this book. The many examples included the book enhance the credibility of the tips that are given in every chapter, on how it is done, or what makes horribly writing.I recommend to check out the index of content on the 'search inside' option to see the content of the book yourself. Buy it and read it and at least you will have good advice on how to embark on an emotional deadth-bed scene, or how to portray emotions, to name just a few. Of course, most of us know, at leat intuitively, much of the advice. But it is always better to have them all summed up once more to refresh the memory, and also to realize why things work out or not. But then you might say 'hey, I already have read dozens of books like this'. Well, like James Frey said, there is no shortcut on reading the masters to see how they do their magic. The same is true for 'how to write' books. If you want to give writing all you have got, then I would say for every tip you did not know yet it would be well worth the price of this book! There will be many of those tips, guaranteed! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"Writer's Digest Books stikes gold yet again with this book of the superb Write Great Fiction series. Nancy Kress smoothly covers the three areas of interest and naturally flows from one to the next as they are related.The characterization section is wonderful. Among other things it suggests complex characters that are revealed through the problems the author brings their way. Ensure they have a backstory and if they change through the book be sure to dramatize it at the end. Also covers different types of characters for different types of fiction.The emotion section was great. Good examples and more general than the rediculous book \\"creating character emotions\\" by hood, there, I won't even capitalize the title or author of that mess. Important emotions are covered in detail such as loving, fighting, and dying with a complete chapter on the most important emotion of all for your lead character. Can you guess what it is? Nancy Kress will tell you.Finally viewpoint. I have read several books already on this subject yet Nancy Kress sweetens the pot even more. Good advice and examples.I would like to add, most books I have read on writing, where the author quotes works for examples of good prose, seem to fall flat. Apparently you must read the entire book quoted to fully appreciate the snippit given as an example. Surprisingly, Nancy Kress steps up to the mound and pitches some wonderful examples that STAND ON THEIR OWN. Nice work Nancy.I bought all but one of the Elements of Fiction Writing. Home runs.

Start with Card first."},{"Title":"Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints (Write Great Fiction)","review":"This book is a good resource for looking at how characters, the emotions they portray and in what viewpoint (first person, third person omniscient, third person limited, etc) to use, and it certainly complements the other books quite nicely. I have read all of the \\"WGF\\" books save for the one on revision and see them all as a great investment.For this particular book, Nancy Kress does do a good job of exploring each element in detail. Like the other books, it is largely an overview of each concept, and, like the other books, she does hit on some similar aspects that the other books cover more extensively (how could she not? All aspects work together to create a work of fiction.) That is to say, the other Write Great Fiction books all cover every aspect of a piece of fiction, but mainly discuss how they relate to the given topic they wrote their respective book about. So brief overviews are found in the other books and each aspect is covered extensively in the given work. So \\"Plot\\" focuses on plot while giving smaller and more general explanations of characters, description, dialogue, etc. while \\"Dialogue\\" does the same with plot, description, characters etc. while keeping the focus on dialogue and so on and so forth. I would recommend a would-be author grab all four of these books, as this would then allow them to see the whole picture.My main problem with this particular book is that when she gets to the section where she delves deeply into first person, at one point at least she goes into a small rabbit trail about why some readers don't like and will never read first person. Apparently they're willing to read books but not willing to suspend their disbelief that the character narrating the work was an active participant. It makes absolutely no sense to me but I am not going to judge these people. My problem with this is that she goes a little bit longer talking about this than what the situation merits, spending at least a page or two on the subject, yet she says NOTHING of authors who write their books in the present tense, even though this style is easily as equally jarring and disengaging as first person, actually more so in my opinion. Why she ignores the pitfalls of writing in present tense yet shows the pitfalls of first person, second person, third person, first person plural, third person plural, multiple first person, multiple third person, hybrid, (and there's more but you get the point,) is beyond me.All in all a good book and I would recommend it.Edit on Saturday February 14th: I would also recommend \\"The Complete Writers Guide to Heroes and Heroines: Sixteen Master Archetypes\\" by Tami D.

As for any RPG, there are two main questions: 1) does it play well and 2) is it fun? \\"Stuperpowers\\" succeeds on both counts, and even provides a rule book that is fun to read.The thing that defines a superhero game is the list of available superpowers. In \\"Stuperpowers\\" you start off with 3, chosen from a list that includes \\"turn bagels into lethal weapons,\\" \\"turn things plaid,\\" \\"teleport into your closet\\" and \\"bionic wet bar.\\" For some it's a real exercise in imagination to make them useful, and this is where a lot of the fun lies.As for the system, well, there are no stats, just a list of your powers and several levels of hurt ranging from \\"ok\\" to \\"KO'd.\\" There are no dice either, all contests are resolved by playing rock-paper-scissors. Humourous games thrive on speed and simplicity, and frankly, game play doesn't get much faster or simple than that.As characters advance in levels they earn additional powers. They also earn bonuses (\\"turn-ons\\") such as \\"spin doctors\\" and \\"super-genius pal.\\" However, their increasing fame also earns \\"turn-offs\\" that might include paparazzi, stalkers or class-action suits. This provides a novel and intriguing method of character advancement and development (something often lacking in humorous games) and adds tremedously to the game's humor potential.If there is a downside to the game, it is the fact that several of the powers are definately R rated (\\"move someone's errogenous zones\\" and \\"concussive breasts\\" being two examples). While this is not a problem for most adult gamers, it does make it awkward if you want to share the game with your kids.

Without mincing words the authors, as witnesses themselves, tell the riveting story of virtuous intent lost through Irish charm, notably that of FBI agent John Connolly, compromising the honesty and integrity of an elite FBI unit and sophisticated Federal prosecutors in Boston, who in turn all succumb to the mystique of ruthless mob boss Whitey Bulger. An insidious tale. Long in the newspapers the highlights are an old story to Bostonians implicating the FBI and running to top level politicians, but the authors have tied it all together in a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction fashion. As for capturing your interest, it reads like a novel. I picked it up and could not put it down until the last chapter.

The violence began after JFK's death.What is the likelihood any useful results will come from Congressional hearings? When will the public waken to the reality that Congress is essentially powerless despite the puffery? A complete accounting of what happened here will most likely involve a massive multiagency task force which can be easily compromised.The FBI is painted as an evil entity but it seems that a system has been in place for many decades, even before Bulger that transcends any one agency and may involve representatives from many agencies cloaked in a veil of secrecy. The problem with this is that you can have groups of employees from whatever agency harassing or targeting individuals and be wholly unaccountable. So if you have rogue FBI agents or officials from other security-related agencies,they can harass and target pretty much in a carefree and unbounded fashion.Or even worse, you can have agents harassing and such with full backing of their management.

In the early 90s this person worked for a defense contractor and was forced to sign documents assuring they would never file for bankruptcy or similar in the future or risk their security clearance being refused.Once the process began they had their home entered on numerous occasions, got strange and periodic phone calls and the like and much more strange phenomena.About a year before Whitey disappeared this person was featured in a newspaper story about their search to find out who their father is after growing up in state care.When Whitey disappeared and Flemmi was incarcerated, this person suddenly could not get work. This person suddenly found themselves surrounded by people on either side of the Bulger case and the target of hate by each. Some individuals targeted this individual by holding promises of job leads and not delivering. It was as if this person was being made to look as if they are lazy and unwilling to work and holding numerous undesirable traits.Some have speculated that these new associates of this person were actually government agents conducting background investigations of this person without their knowledge or trying to destroy this person's reputation in an effort to hurt them for a background they knew little of.This person was also approached by an 'investigator' and an attorney hailing from the 'Bergen county,NJ' area.Also, this person began having job interviews in which individuals they worked with a decade or more were mentioned and if this person said they remembered working with them, they were refused the job.If the media checks into information provided in this case, such as with America's Most Wanted or other such clearinghouses, you might find that a lot of leads and info pertinent to this case have not been followed up because the leads point to individuals transferring between different agencies or to powerful political figures."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Has anyone considered that one or more of the guys involved in this case might be NSA or DoD employees?

Taking place on the mean streets of South Boston, a mere twenty miles or so from where I've lived my whole life, this book tells of a violent intersection of cultures: the tribal culture of Irish America, the often-closed culture of the Federal Bureau of investigation, and the violent culture of organized crime. And unfortunately, it's all true. At bottom, &quot;Black Mass&quot; presents a haze of divided allegiances and moral ambiguity, that may well shake your faith in our government-appointed protectors.Looming large over the whole story is the imposing figure of James J. Bulger Jr., or &quot;Whitey Buljah&quot; as he is more commonly known around these parts. Long before the Bloods and Crips were household names, Bulger emerged from a culture where street gangs were omnipresent and career options for adults were mostly restricted to the Armed services, politics, factory and police work, or crime. Unfortunately, Whitey Bulger never quite outgrew the gang culture of his youth, and he proved exceedingly skilled at the crime profession. As intelligent as he was soulless, Bulger graduated from street enforcer to bank robber (with a stint in Alactraz along the way) to organized crime kingpin with his hand in all things illegal as the head of the vicious Winter Hill Gang. Along for the ride was the aptly nicknamed Stevie &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi, a barbaric killer whose Mafia connections made him a perfect stoolie in the Boston FBI's war against the Mafia.It was in 1975 against the backdrop of the FBI's battle with La Cosa Nostra that FBI agent John Connolly, who emerged from the same projects as Bulger, crafted a plan to bring Whitey and Flemmi into the Bureau's fold as informants. It sounded like a sweet deal for all those concerned: Bulger and Flemmi got to take out the Winter Hill Gang's competition, and the FBI got a well-placed ally in its effort to bring down Boston's ruling Angiulo family. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out that way. The FBI did manage to bring down the Angiulos, due largely to its now-legendary wiretapping operation at Gennaro Angiulo's headquarters, but Bulger and Flemmi remained connected to the FBI long after they had outlived their usefulness. In fact, as this book makes clear, the two gangsters greatly enlarged their stature in Boston's underworld during the 1980's, and they did it with the full knowledge and even collaboration of the FBI.As O'Neill and Lehr explain, the shared South Boston origins of Bulger and Connolly, which seemed like such an asset back in 1975 when Connolly was recruiting Whitey, ultimately became a liability. Coming from a tight-knit, tribal culture like Southie, Connolly couldn't exactly be counted on to maintain his objectivity in dealing with Bulger, whom he even came to refer to as a &quot;good bad guy.&quot; An even deeper problem, though, was John Connolly himself: a smooth-talking lady's man who liked the high life a bit too much, Connolly eventually became virtually indistinguishable from his prized informants. Hanging out with Bulger and Flemmi and accepting their gifts, Connolly didn't just look the other way while Bulger, Flemmi &amp; Co. enlarged their empire and the bodies piled up; he was an active assistant in their operation. Although they were frequently pursued by the Massachusetts State Police, local detectives, and even the DEA, the two gangsters were virtually untouchable.Perhaps even worse, O'Neill and Lehr make it clear that the FBI's mishandling of its two prized informants went beyond John Connolly's corruption to encompass a massive institutional failure. With Connolly corrupted and a series of supervisors compromised, the Bureau's guidelines for oversight of informants became essentially null and void. Falsified reports that exaggerated Bulger and Flemmi's usefulness while understating their criminal activities became the norm, and even those in other law enforcement agencies who suspected something amiss had their efforts blocked. One painful lesson to be drawn from this book is that the law is only as strong as those who enforce it. When those charged with stopping crime drift to the other side, where do we turn then?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"No one seems to be investigating whether Bulger and Flemmi were coerced into service against their wishes. Examine for a second the plausibility of Bulger and Flemmi going 'legit'..There might have been a very good chance their phone calls were intercepted or monitored. Say Bulger was looking for serious work- if the line was monitored or calls intercepted, the calls could either not be received or those parties calling to offer work could be approached without Bulger's knowledge, keeping him from finding work. All any agency would need to do is mention either national security or an ongoing investigation and neither could get work.A year or two ago the FBI busted some people for operating an illegal software ring and the leader was a NEC employee from Chelmsford, Mass. Following the bust, local media reported that the ringleader wanted to be 'allowed to find work', suggesting that even without a trial, the government could keep the person from legitimate work. Why could this not have been done to Bulger and Flemmi?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book puts all the pieces together from every news report on Boston's organized crime problem. It proves that neighborhood ties and fantasy are stronger than the oaths that some of our law enforcement people make. Growing up in Boston, Whitey was an elusive figure that the Irish looked up to as a protector. He was legendary and people were star struck if they saw him. He took advantage of the strong loyalty ties the people of South Boston have to eachother. Nowhere else could he have been more successful. If you know some of the players and have followed the stories over the years you will love this book."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Is this case the intersection of several government agencies? The FBI, NSA,CIA, DEA, etc.?There is one individual who may be related to one of the major players in this case but did not know it because they were raised in state child care and this information was withheld from them.In 1992-93 the individual is said to have been approached by an official alleging ties to one or more of the above agencies and essentially threatened. In the same year that Whitey disappeared, this person lost their job and was leveraged into a position by a person with alleged ties to Gov Cellucci and George Bush. While at this position, the individual became subject to many many attacks by the small group of 'coworkers', several that suggested ties to the State police and to federal agencies. As the person experienced a wide array of telephone problems, tens of thousands of resumes sent out over a course of 5-6 years resulted in rejection after rejection. A number of these coworkers suggested pro-Whitey, anti-Connolly and mixed sentiments towards Cellucci and Harshbarger in Masachusets."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book and the whole case has done little to fully examine how Bulger and Flemmi were made to work as informants.If you hypothesize that they were selected and trained adhering to security agreements, then the supervising agency could have used the collective might of the govt to come down on these guys and prevent them from NOT working as informants.Other agencies and contacts in the private sector could have cooperated in blackballing these guys and controlling their activities by giving only selective information to the agency or party to be used against Bulger and Flemmi.Here the other branches of govt involved or contacts in private industry could have helped blackball these guys thinking they were serving national interests.Example: agency A approaches company B that Bulger applies to for work alleging Bulger under investigation, drug trafficker,etc, thus preventing Bulger from getting work. company B knows only what agency A tells them. And if these guys phones were tapped, any agencies monitoring knew their every move as discussed on phone.This book and the case in general treats Bulger and Flemmi as very willing participants but until Flemmi and Bulger can speak freely we don't know if this is true. We also don't know if a third party committed much of the violence in this case and blamed it on Flemmi and Bulger.If you also hypothesize that no one acquires any position of power or wealth in this country without the approval of the govt, then those so in power become potential tools to use against detractors or fall guys.How free could these guys have been if the IRS, FBI,Justice Dept,Customs,CIA,NSA,DIS,DEA,US Marshalls,Secret Service,etc were mobilized against them?Or the possibility that organized crime had this control over them?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There are many many negatives to this case but one of the positives is perhaps some overhauling and reflection on the structure of the Top Echelon program is in order. This program offered financial incentives and opportunities for career advancement within the FBI and there may be similar incentives in the other branches as well. Rewarding performance is one thing but does this program by design encourage self-serving injustices?One might ask if agencies such as the FBI fit an individual to a crime as opposed to the crime to the individual. Is the FBI often pressured for results no matter what despite ambiguities? Part of the negative publicity in this case is due to the FBI's hard-nosed,bullying persona. Often times this is accompanies law enforcement in general.Another dimension to this case is how informants and witnesses seem to be viewed in general by the govt. The fact that individuals went to the FBI seeking help and wound up dead, regardless of who did it, points to serious security flaws in the handling of these people.The number of people who opt out of witness protection might also reflect on how witnesses are treated and it must not be so great if people would rather risk death than stay in the program.We are raised not to tattle-tale but also to do the right thing. In matters where serious crime is involved, if we turn the other cheek we are viewed as tacitly approving the activity yet if we try to stop it we are 'rats'. There is a dilemma here.A big question we might ask is why our agencies keep letting us down? They protection us a lot but they hurt us a lot as well. One only has to look at the Hoover FBI, recent revelations of advanced technologies that suggest our computers might be weapons against us, Cointelpro, and this case to be concerned. Do these agencies set their own agendas or does it come from the top? Or how much input and discretion does a field agent really have?

I have had correspondence with the Justice Dept in which they kept much of it,redacted some of it, and just kept collecting it and never doing anything about it. Later i found out the hard way that some of my pleas for help with the Justice Dept had been leaked to some of the people harassing me. This is perhaps similar to the experience of McIntyre and others in the Bulger case.After contacting the Justice Dept, i suddenly became unemployable and had episodes of harassment here and there. One day i went to the car dealership to have my car serviced. Before I got there, an older man wearing his US marshalls cap was at the service desk and made a point of approaching me with some light banter. I had had much positive experience with this dealer. After he left, the dealer told me my car would cost 3x higher to fix than it later did at another garage when i refused.In this case some individuals approached the FBI and it was leaked out,later getting them killed. People at the Justice Dept and FBI have top secret security clearances and they are supposed to be trustworthy. Just before he fled, it was leaked to the paper that Bulger was an informant-- was this designed to make him a target and to avoid the controversy that has now erupted?And with all the heat coming down on Connolly and his family, does this go to show what all the extensive background info that goes into a high level clearance and govt work is compiled for-- future retaliation?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Believe it or not, John Connolly's admiration of Whitey has been no surprise to South Boston - it was so open and brazen that everyone knew - why it took so long for him to be indicted is beyond me.The FBI, through John Connolly, allowed gangsters to murder, extort and run drugs through my community.

But at its heart is agent John Connolly, an FBI star who turns out to be incredibly corrupt and unable to resist the charms of Bulger, whom he idolized as a kid when they both grew up in the same housing project in South Boston. The evidence presented in this book against Connolly and some of his fellow, crooked FBI agents is devastating. Some others have claimed that there are two sides of the story, that Connolly was a good guy. Think again. He was as rotten as year-old fish.

In the 1960s these two areas were in funding conflicts between those who wanted the space program(Somerville) and those who wanted the Boston Navy Yard (Charlestown).Question: did the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars result over money and how it would be spent in the Boston and metro Boston areas?With the Bulger case, you have Kevin Weeks showing investigators he knows where bodies are then attributing them to Bulger and Flemmi, but there is only his word that Bulger and Flemmi did it.You have Bulger and Flemmi who hail from Boston but take over Somerville turf. Then wreak havoc on both sides.Around the time of the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars, local newspapers estimated at least 24+ separate organized crime families in operation. I am no scholar,but some research of the local history and social phenomena in play suggests that 'mob wars' are triggered by major economic events in which one or more of the organized crime factions feel that have not received their fair share.If this is true, then the civil war between the space program advocates and the Navy yard advocates may have provided fodder for the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars.If the violence was at severe as has been alleged, perhaps Flemmi and Bulger, former military personnel were assigned the task of restoring order to a situation that exceeded the capacity of local and state law enforcement.

How much of the allegations are true and how much is puffery? If you look at the distinction between personal and professional conduct outlined in the handbook on informants described in this book, it appears there is wide latitude between what is tolerated 'on the job' versus 'off the job'.There is a marked difference between Bulger's conduct off the job and on the job. Was this a man who acted as an informant for fun or out of desperation? There is much about Whitey's 'wild side', but one might note there are some positive attributes there also-- a fondness for libraries and reading, health and fitness, loyalty to family.Was he tough? Of this there is little doubt.Does the government either set people up or approach people who have been convicted and give them an alternative: work for us or spend many years in prison? How many people would do things they never thought possible to avoid this ugly choice?This case also shows the ends used. The FBI is alleged to tamper with home and car at will, play off sides against each other,feeding on healthy paranoia considering the inherent dangers organized crime brings. The book is also honest in that organized crime players are not portrayed as volunteers feeding the hungry at food kitchens either. What in a broad sense is played out here is groups at complementary ends of the spectrum slicing up pieces of the pie. Greed and hunger for power are the fuel.Is this case a fundamental issue of bad people in a good system, average people in a bad system, or a mix of good and bad people in a mediocre system? Is the convergence of these two worlds an economic necessity?One can also ask what makes an informant and why do they do it? How many are people who have become targets of criminal activity and seek help through the legal channels available? as children we are taught that if someone steals your car, you don't hunt them down-- you go the police.You go to the police and are considered a rat but if you take matters in yourown hands you are a vigilante.The guidelines described in here also allow for a wide array of crimes that are acceptable for informants. An informant, according to this book, could say break into your home, plant false evidence or rob you and there is nothing wrong with this. Informants could help with illegal wiretaps and other evidence gathering techniques and this is ok. Should informants be honest people trying to help reduce crime or potential crime?Bulger is alleged to have made a lot of money but to have lived a pretty down to earth lifestyle.

After the paper did a story, this individual was transferred to another division of the company then not long after &quot;laid off&quot;.After that, the individual began getting approached by individuals who began collecting information on him/her and used whatever they got to hurt this person. Wherever the person did business, rented videos,did banking,etc, that person had nothing but problems. The person began having all sorts of problems at the college they attended and any Massachusetts state programs the person applied for ,such as retraining for those laid off from work, were quickly denied.In addition, these individuals alternately implied changing political affiliations between the Democratic and Republican parties. All of this seemed to stem from simply asking who their father was ,as this person had been abandoned into state care very young and was told little of their family history.This person worked for a company with government contracts and the question has been raised as to whether government agencies were offensively attacking the person. If Bulger,Flemmi,Rico,Connolly and others fell under the agencies that oversee security cleared employees, one might find that these guys were heavily controlled and prone to inordinate personal problems if they failed to comply. Their financial status may have been monitored and messed with as a behavioral modification gesture if they acted in a way contrary to organization goals. This person i mentioned had vehicles tampered with, financial and phone records monitored, individuals they associated with approached by govt officials and much more. Most of this was difficult to prove and this is how these agencies get away with it is by having several individuals mess with the target individual from different angles, as these guys may have experienced. Local politicians seemed to care less."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There are many many scary things going on right now. 60 Minutes recently had a segment discussing the FISA court, a secret court where the Justice Dept can obtain 24 hour long term surveillance warrants against targets without that target being able to see the probable cause or evidence against them and so has no defense. This permits the govt to search through your trash,enter your home when you are away,bug every room in your home and tap your phone, acquiring your deepest secrets and that of your family and friends. The Secret Service is beginning a childhood profiling program to 'identify' problem kids according to some model only they know as well as building voice and picture profiles on everyone. A National genetic database is being built so that even your family genes will not be safe. Carnivore and other as yet unannounced software programs allow the govt to screen email and internet activities and in general scan the internet environment looking for targets.Technologies are being introduced that will someday force you and i to have ourselves and/or our children implanted with electronic tracking chips ostensibly for noble puproses but which may have far more nefarious motives. And companies such as EMC and others are buildng vast storage capability that will one day allow massive amounts of information to be stored about anyone. Our privacy dwindles until one day nothing in our lives will be sacred. One of the many issues in this book is the amount of control the govt has over its employees, but also how much the govt will frame its own employees to save institutional face. Recently the CIA went after some of its own for having a secret chat room and fired and disciplined a number of them. Chances are these chatrooms were relatively harmless but they went back 15 years! The problem here is that any lawyers and judges brought in to defend the employees must be cleared by the CIA, not enough time to mount a defense on behalf of the employees. One thing of serious concern is whether there is an integral relationship between organized crime and organizations such as NSA or other such supersecret,elite organizations."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There is a man referred to in prior reviews who worked for Grace and was a state orphan who may be a target of harassment in all of this because of a link unknown to that man.

Over the next few years it became apparent this investigator and his 'friend' began setting up the man by carefully orchestrated telephone calls and surreptitious taping of staged conversations. The Newbury man claimed to be his friend while threatening him,pretending to represent Jan Schlictmann and Grace,alternately.One question no one has explored is the possible link between Jonathan Harr's book and the gangland and political fallout so pronounced in the Whitey Bulger case. Was a child of one of the principals in the Bulger case sick from the pollution in Woburn and was this child treated under the condition of service to the government and/or private parties by that child's father. And was a promise made to look out for the child but when it was revealed that this was not done, the principal in the case fled, realizing they had been victim of a snow job?Also, could such a child have been the target of casebuilding against that child by individuals linked to state child care agencies as &quot;social workers&quot; who in reality were building a blackmail file against the child as that child grew up?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"1) Has the former business partner of Rocco Solimeno and associate of Cogliano, a supporter of Cellucci waged war against a possible child of Whitey Bulger or some other principals in this case?2) Has the government harassed a possible child of Whitey by controlling the means of income and therefore also use of credit in an effort to utterly destroy the child or have the Bulger forces done this to a child perhaps of one of their victims?3) Is a man who has been devastated since the onset of this case a target of pro-Angiulo/Patriarca forces?4) Could the concealment of Whitey's whereabouts be the efforts of both FBI and Justice Department forces,similar to their withholding info from the government reform committee?5) Have the official records of a child raised in state care and possibly the key to the whole Bulger case been sanitizedby state officials and subcontractors and does the appointment of Jeff Locke to head such an agency by Cellucci have anything to do with this?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Does the federal government have a vested interest in crime?

The man's family history had largely been withheld from him.Also, a man with out of state plates moved in next door claiming to work construction. As strange phone callskept coming into the man's home,one day the man saw his neighbor driving a phone company truck.That man soon moved out and the origin of the strange calls was the workplace in which he was surrounded by individuals blaming him for the Bulger case.8) As the Bulger case matured, medical records and other official records began disappearing on the man.9) Individuals who had been introduced as caretakers of the boy later completely disavowed the man when the Bulger case burst out.10) As the Bulger case hearings moved along, individuals, usually in the capacity of a new coworker began befriending the man.It soon become evident they were investigating the man and when confronted did not deny being involved with law enforcement or the justice department.Such investigations apppeared to focus on the man's home,dating habits,and financial transactions even though the man had no criminal record. Most of the individuals involved claimed roots in New Hampshire. As the congressional hearings matured, the man became the target of increasing traffic stops with each time the officer appearing to have knowledge about the person they could not have had in a random stop.11) Money vanished from the man's bank account without explanation; even with receipts showing a discrepancy had occurred and spending hours discussing it with bank branch personnel,no satisfactory explanation was ever offered. The bank at the time held Internal Revenue Service accounts and supported a major political candidate in the region.12) When the man went to vote, thug-like men appeared menacingly watching him."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Nearly 40 years ago a boy was born and hurried away by the mother because the husband, a bank robber( Whitey traveled with bank robbers), threatened to kill the baby. A couple of years later the boy ended up living in a hospital ward for more than 2 years as a cripple.During the 2+ years no one came to visit,leaving the child confined to a bed in an uncomfortable traction system. When the child was released a diagnosis of the condition not listed in the medical record at the time was given and no family history known. Six months after release to the mother the child was attempting suicide by exiting cars on the highway. While with his 'mother',the child experienced a house fire, repeated long term beatings and creative tortures by a stepfather in between attempted murder and later an attempted suicide of the mother all while the child was still effectively crippled.On being removed by the state,the child bounced around family to family unwanted and subject to continual humiliation (insults,threats,deprivations),obviously being situated with families that hated him( italian) and wished him no good. All of these placements occurred in the geographical vicinity of major players and in the Bulger case. When signs of severe abuse began emerging, the child was punished further with beatings or worse. The child seemed to never play or have toys and at one point some kindly school personnel gave the boy time to play and toys while others continued the regimen of beatings to 'get him in line'. Eventually the boy landed in a residential program near the time Whitey signed on to Top Echelon. He and his brother were separated long before this. At about this time and for the next 30 years the boy was introduced to individuals who later surfaced as having strong evidence of links to the players in this case. Nearly all were in some form paid for their connection to the boy. The boy didn't see this,but rather saw them as good people and loved them. Over the next 30 years the boy would be introduced to sexual predators,DOJ personnel,military personnel (army and air force-- Whitey was air force/Flemmi army) and be threatened with youth lockups(by a caretaker of the same name as one of the agents in this book), placed into a hard labor program breaking granite boulders with sledgehammers while being threatened by local police harassment by program administrators and suffer the loss of dozens of peers he was thrilled to call 'friend'. The boy was always told he was no good, a bad person, and would end up in trouble. When the boy eventually ran away, he did well in school,survived through high school by working 2-3 jobs and volunteered.In 1995 Bulger fled and the man's life changed. He couldn't find work, lived off credit cards,eventually lost his home and was forced to live in his car while working to eat. He became insolvent and defaulted on his debts after years of trying to establish good credit. A major creditor even raised his interest rate on a credit card after he notified them of his hardship. From this same creditor the man received almost daily calls with no message other than silence without explanation. Later, the former director of the FBI was hired by them. Individuals appeared in the boy's life claiming some affiliation with the FBI,DOJ, or Bureau of Prisons. In most of these introductions and the subsequent 'friendships' that developed through the brother as an intermediary, the end result was these introductions later led to harmful acts by those parties. This took the form of gaining the man's confidence,waiting for info that could be harmful to that man, then using it to deliver the sting. That sting took the form of job losses,police stops under suspicious circumstances,phone trouble, or sudden,spontaneous breakdown of friendships where these parties were introduced. All the while the brother claimed to have worked for one of foremost gangsters rivalling Bulger/Flemmi during a time when the 2 brothers were not in contact and perhaps even when the crucial info was being gathered that led to the downfall of that gangster. When the man tried to contact a principal government reform committee member, that number was promptly disconnected."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"One might wonder if in all this chaos, what would happen if Whitey had children? How might Connolly, Rico, Morris and the Justice Department handle this? Could the children becoma targets for blackballing or manipulation by the FBI, DEA,CIA,NSA,DIS,or many more agencies?It is alleged there is at least person who might have connections to some of the people involved in this case and worked for a defense contractor in the 1980s and 1990s. About the time of the change between the Bush and Clinton administration, the individual was informed they were ' being watched'. A few years later, Whitey disappeared and this person suddenly became unemployable while individuals allegedly indirectly linked to Connolly and therefore Governor Cellucci through George Cashman threatened this person had 'flipping burgers' in their future. The individual attended a college and was promptly given one letter grade lower than earned after being asked if the individual would vote for Al Gore. The person went on to have an interview with a major defense contractor where individuals with NSA logo materials inquired if the person understood what a &quot;controlled experiment is&quot;. Additionally, the individual reported strange phone activity not long after an older man with TN plates appeared claiming to be in the construction field but was later discovered in a phone company truck. On being seen in the phone company truck, the man disappeared.At the last place the individual worked, colleagues claimed this person was paranoid or claimed the person worked with them for years but they did not know this individual's job title. Individuals with strong ties to recruiters and human resources in the Mass. high tech industry sector and with alleged ties to the Mass. republican party suddenly had no work of any kind in what was considered an ' employee's market'.What we know from this book and newspaper accounts is that circumstances can and are manipulated to make an individual 'paranoid', such as the ploys used against Whitey and Eddie Moiano. By controlling the environment with multiple individuals, a portrait is manufactured of the person as unstable should any legal action be taken."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Whitey was allegedly warned by his brother not to enroll in a CIA study. In a recent TV documentary inside the CIA lobby is allegedly a plaque that quotes &quot; ..And the truth shall set you free&quot; from the bible. Did Whitey find truth or consequences? Billy Bulger was strong advocate for defending children from child abuse and this should be considered. Whitey had support from Speaker of the House John W. McCormack and in his brother's book, William mentions that he felt his brother had enormous potential. Billy Bulger also made enemies during the forced busing crisis of the early 1970s,where desegregation was to provide racial integration and failed because parent's rights to supervise their children's safe education was usurped. The authors have a history with the Bulger family and this should be noted when reading this book.Whitey also worked as a custodian for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, highest court in the state. When considering this case one needs to see both sides. The FBI can influence NY Times bestseller lists, or destroy an individual's reputation or save a country from terrorists. You need to look further,where the public cannot see, to see the real danger as special interests claiming this massive authority as its own. 60 Minutes had a story on how even the NSA is subject to the whims of politicians and has arranged to use its incredible surveillance capabilities on US citizens and politicians. And the CIA has a long long history of establishing policy irrespective of its political overseers.On the one hand we have agencies with extraordinary capacity but a citizen populace with a herd mentality that many in authority view as ill informed about current events and therefore not capable of making good decisions.What seems to be a big issue in this case is the destabilization of a region (Massachusetts in the Irish violence of the 60s and 70s) and government efforts to stabilize it and stop the bloodshed. Under such circumstances and with limited knowledge, we can but second guess the tactics used. The victims in this case lost family members and there is the reality of broken families and its subsequent tragedy.But the Mafia is not known for its benevolence either. Take Rocky Graziano (allegedly set up by mob), or even Rocky Marciano ( financially drained throughout his career by his 'manager')and countless others who have helped and crossed the mob.The mob is about making money (lots of it) and power. Sometimes the mob does good and sometimes the FBI might do wrong, and this reflects human nature.Until a major spiritual trasnformation occurs in mankind, there will always be that battle going on between those skirting or flaunting the system and those whose job is to uphold the system."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is a study in how informants are made and maintained...

The crux of this case seems to center around events of the mid 1960s in Massachusetts and New England at the height of Kennedy power and where a minimum of 24+ organized crime factions are said to have existed.It seems plausible Massachusetts was the center of an economic civil war between the space and military camps for federal funds.The whole Mass/New England area was flooded with space programs and military bases and JFK was pro-space while Tip O'Neill and the Boston region favored the military bases or related sectors. As the space program gained favor, the military was seeing base and other cuts from Robert McNamara. what we see going on now seems to be a reverse of the struggle going on in the 1960s, a shift from military-based projects to high tech nonmilitary projects.Hypothesis: were the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars precipitated by the regional battle for funding between factions on the space side and those on the military side? A breakdown of the respective committees supporting each may shed some light on this question.Boston Edison approved land in Woburn for further development around the time NASA was to locate a site there and a Radiology lab was also established in the region. JFK was a proponent of the NASA site in Woburn and John Connolly later procured a job with Edison. Barry Mawn was brought into the Boston FBI office after Whitey fled, Mawn being a Woburn native. Whitey disappeared prior to the release of &quot;A Civil Action&quot; by Jonathan Harr,about Woburn and the aftermath of early leukemia epidemic signs emerging in the 1960s. Whitey is said to have had a girlfriend in Woburn. NASA did not come and this left an economic void in the region. Could all of this tie together?

Were Flemmi,Bulger and Mercurio targeted as kids to become informants through long term monitoring and manipulation? Was Bulger made by the government? In his brother's book, William Bulger describes Whitey as quite intelligent but coming from a tough neighborhood and who frequently received harsh beatings by the Boston Police.It is said that when agencies such as the CIA recruit, they will cultivate a recruit and orchestrate events such that the recruit will have no choice but to relent and work for it. Some tactics employed are said to be: spreading rumors that cast doubt on the character of the target such that employment opportunities are few,if any..also, harassment of the friends and family members of the target or buying off family and friends to no longer have contact with the target thus controlling the relationships that person has. How did Flemmi 'recruit' Bulger? What does the handling of informants by the federal government say to all current and future informants? What is the government saying to its own agents in the manner it is treating the Boston FBI agents?

The guilty agents who conspired and protected Bulger and Flemmi, the agents and supervisors who should have prevented the acts and the agents and supervisors who should have known about the acts should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.But it gets worse, now the U.S. Justice Department has made deals with the remaining Bulger gang members including Kevin Weeks. All the federal prosecutorial eggs are in one basket to build a case against &quot;Whitey Bulger.&quot; What if he is already dead.

It may be that because they were so successful, replacements for them have been tracked as youngsters and maneuvered into circumstances to replace them. Whitey might not have been able to succeed in normal industry if the govt was all over him. Perhaps the govt made it such for him that he could not get meaningful work and had to resort to crime to survive. Perhaps Whitey even has a child somewhere who has been used against him so if Whitey did not comply with his handlers his child might be neglected,abused or worse.

Maximum pressure seems to be applied here.The tactics seem so heavy-handed that one might wonder how much control this small core group really had for nearly 3 decades. The allegations made are indeed very serious, but as is all too common, one is presumed guilty before proven innocent.All the allegations may or may not be true but this remains to be proven in court.The media has permitted many allegations except the possibility that many of them may not be true. As the murder victims have found out, the govt is not always forthcoming with information where it might be exposed in a sensitive light.

In the late 1970s a boy who was being overseen by former government officials,\\"Patsy\\" was assigned a female social worker by the name of Debbie Richards, a name mentioned in this book. Patsy was bounced around in state child care while William Bulger was in the Senate. In 1982 Patsy was befriended by \\"Tim\\",a man claiming to be a former \\"mental health counselor\\" undergoing a career change while at technical school. Just prior to meeting \\"Tim\\", another man appeared in Woburn,Mass ,where Patsy lived, going by the same name at a different address. \\"Patsy II\\" began creating problems for Patsy I, notably going AWOL in the army and much more while sending authorities after Patsy I.In 1992 Patsy was introduced by mutual friend to \\"John Doe\\" and a new friendship was formed. In 1995 Whitey fled after a local newspaper article in the Boston area did a story on Patsy' search for his unknown father and family roots.About the same time, \\"Tim\\" and \\"John Doe\\" began acting strange...\\"Tim\\" began acting inexplicably hostile while \\"John Doe\\" began acting hostile and accusatory. Later,John Doe claimed to be taking notes and possibly tape recording staged conversations, in which Patsy was steered into making statements which could be taken out of context as if building a case for later use. Tim began doing the same.Tim hailed from the area where an FBI office existed in Merrimack Valley in Massachusetts. This whole situation appeared as if a boy tied to one of the principals in the Bulger case was systematically assigned monitors to keep tabs on him during the period Bulger and Flemmi operated and when Bulger fled and the situation unravelled, the boy,now a man,became a target of revulsion and blackballing.

Even if there is a legitimate need, how do we know this information is not gathered simply to publicly humiliate later on? Has the government and its agents proven trustworthy in this case,MK Ultra,Cointelpro, and so forth?What protections do ordinary law abiding citizens have to offset approved institutional tyranny or by rogue agents thereof? Is it the mandate of government management to compile damaging information as surety against public protest against policy initiatives in the future? What is the line between balanced control and oppression?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book will amuse the casual true crime reader, but the cognoscenti will laugh it off. Why these two reporters are being heralded for this book when it is merely a slapdash re-write of old Boston Globe articles is beyond me. Yes, the saga of the Bulger Brothers is indeed singular, but the real down and dirty story has yet to emerge, and probably will not until all parties are dead and buried. Someone who actually lived with the personalities and knows the piquant details will spill the real beans on this Boston drama someday - save your money for that book."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I read it cover to cover and back through again to find out why it was that I didn't like it. It's simple. The authors rely so heavily on the word of Flemmi, a mob &quot;rat,&quot; who felt abandoned by his FBI handlers after he was indicted, that I have a hard time lending any credence to what he says. For that matter, the authors hold such deep contempt for John Connolly that their reporting of &quot;true&quot; incidents seems terribly biased. I don't doubt that after all the court cases have made it through the system, they will right yet another book. I doubt they'll provide any further insight into this Boston scandal then they do in this book."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book could have been shortened to 50 pages. It was so redundant. The authors attempted (rather weakly) to create all this hype. I can summarize the book in a few sentences-- Mobsters and FBI agents conspire to commit crimes and cover up those crimes using the power of the FBI office. They get cocky, they get busted. Wow, end of story. And oh- paratroopers dont \\"storm the beaches\\" they \\"parachute\\" usually behind enemy lines to create shock and awe and disrupt the enemies supply lines. And what is a white shoe person anyway?

Either these guys are really as dangerous as is alleged or something is wrong here. Did these guys choose this or were they forced to do this? How much did they do and how much is attributed to them as whipping boys? Who in their right mind would choose this sort of life? Bulger has been alleged to be a serial killer-- but no one is contemplating the difference between one who murders for hire and one who murders from some psychological disturbance. Society is designed to handle the serial killer but not the sociopath who kills because of a VALUE problem, not because of mental incompetency. Bulger and Flemmi have been alleged to demand 'their cut..' but a further question remains-- who demanded 'their cut' from Bulger and Flemmi? Human nature is largely to blame for this scenario. If you do not pay your taxes, fail to pay traffic tickets, or are unfortunate enough to have a court rule against you, men and women with guns, not bibles, come to see you.And with vague construction and swift stroke of pen, legislators can initiate a chain of events that can hurl individuals into financial ruin or homelessness,effectively harming them as much as an overtly violent act can.As long as a 'survival of the fittest' mentality prevails, we will always have organized crime,public corruption and sheep and wolves."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There is a man who was driven out of Massachusetts and totally impoverished when Whitey fled the state. The man is mentioned in some reviews here and seems to have become a target for major harassment. The man,following this case becoming a media spectacle,attempted to contact Dan Burton but Mr. Burton's phone number was promptly disconnected while just prior his aides gave the man the run around. Before trying to contact Mr. Burton, the man attempted to contact Senator Kennedy,Marty Meehan,Scott Harshbarger,John Kerry and many more but was ignored on all accounts.This might seem as Powerful forces ignoring some nutcase, but consider the following:1) A few years before Bulger fled the man was &quot;briefed&quot; by a government official about an ongoing project at a defense contractor in Massachusetts but not told what the project involved or how he was connected to it nor the duration while being forced to sign an acknowledgement.2) The man had as key adults in his life growing up links to names or organizations pertinent to some of the government personnel scrutinized in this case.3) The man has been kept in a state of impoverishment particularly the past 3 years while creditors such as Citibank Discover and many more have been extremely unsympathetic despite being given extensive explanations of the circumstances.4) The man, until 1995 and after, was always able to care for himself and often worked 2-4 jobs simultaneously to do so.. making the circumstances following Bulger's 1995 flight from justice appear as if the man was being forced to fail in every way and aspect of life, similar to treatment State Trooper Johnson received after stopping Whitey at Logan airport and before Johnson committed suicide.5) The man is said to have been befriended by associates with links to John Connelly as a young child and which acquaintances suddenly turned hostile and manipulative when this all broke out.6) The man apparently has convenient telephone problems in sync with the Government Reform hearings or when a major news story appears about developments in the Bulger case.It is quite likely for example, if the Government Reform committee attempted to contact the man in person,by letter, or by phone that such attempts would be intefered with in an aura of convenient coincidence."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"One might ask after reading this excellent book whether 2 kids,say brothers, were groomed to follow in the Bulger's footsteps but perhaps something went awry??I know of 2 brothers from Massachusetts. Both were raised in state care during Bulger's reign. The older brother went into the army and a couple years later the younger was being harassed by activities a man who bore the same name in the same town, as if the younger brother had another identity created and which was made to look bad to hurt him in the identity confusion following. It is speculated the older brother set up the younger brother, both from Woburn,Mass and that the older brother after a name change went into FBI service at his younger brother's constant expense.Wherever the younger brother went the older followed and bad thingsalways happened to the younger as a result.

Lehr and o'Neill relate the amazing story of the twisted connection between the Bulger family, the community of Boston and &quot;Southie&quot;, and the Boston office of the FBI.I could not put this book down. After reading a few chapters I was desparate for news on the Bulger case, and the story continues to unfold to this day. Whitey Bulger is still at large and on the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list, FBI agent John Connolly was recently sentenced for his crimes, and Billy Bulger was, until this past August, President of the University of Massachusetts system. Connections between Billy and Whitey are still being drawn by government agencies and prosecutors and refuted by Billy and the FBI.Read this book and you will be swept with a new hobby: keeping yourself aware of new developments in the Bulger case.

I live in the Boston area and I have family that knows some of the players involved. I think that fact made it even more chilling to me as I wasn't aware of some of the details surrounding different events. I am glad I read it, but I don't need to revisit it anytime soon."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"One thing to consider in this whole case is the business implications of justice. Use of informants may reduce labor costs and insurance liability for law enforcement or other agencies. Informants are routinely used even though the public is criticizing the informants in this case. For example, govt agencies and companies frequently hire undercover investigators from such firms as Pinkerton security, Wackenhut, Allied Security and so on to spy on employees for a variety of reasons, including theft, embezzlement and so on. Mass. Atty General Tom O'Reilly has retained Decision Strategies to help his office independently investigate the Big Dig. Also, informants in law enforcement can serve to utilize methods which may be in conflict with agency regulations. For example, an informant can procure personal information on someone where legal work must be done to secure authorization and so leave an auditable trail and the informant allows ongoing informational updates that are largely invisible to ouside parties. But this also has a scary side, in that large amounts of data are being gathered with an ambiguous motivation. Informants are a key source of data and data is power,as the legal profession knows all too well. Another aspect is that as bad as organized crime can be, in the 'big picture' organized crime may be much less dangerous in the eyes of the government than say a whistleblower, for organized crime skirts the laws while whistleblowers challenge the system and its integrity. Organized crime allows the system to basically persist as is but whistleblowers can cause systemic change. And a third concern is the relationship between law enforcement as a prosecutorial power and the vested business interests in providing a steady flow of prisoners. For example, the Justice Dept possesses enormous power to prosecute and convict, essentially unlimited resources drawn from taxpayer dollars but it also runs Unicor, or federal prison industries which makes viable consumer products and is a business conglomerate with a captive workforce and subsequent low labor costs. Additionally, every prisoner brings so many dollars into the system to provide jobs for corrections personnel and law enforcement support personnel and allied personnel up the chain. These are some factors to take into account in a comprehensive analysis of what happened here and what goes on in general."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"O'Neill &amp; Lehr have a history with the Bulger brothers as does Jeremiah O'Sullivan. O'Neill &amp; Lehr interviewed William Bulger about misconstrued dealings with 75 State Street. Whitey had an advocate in former Speaker of the House John McCormack, who believed Whitey could do quite well if given half a chance. Whitey also worked for a short time as a custodian at the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. William Bulger is heavily connected, having ties to Jackie Birmingham, Thomas Birmingham's father, Senator John Kerry who has indirect ties to the extended Kennedy clan and many other notables. In his book William Bulger details how thorough FBI scrutiny can be and it is likely the FBI has extensively monitored the entire family. What might have happened in this case is that drastic measures were taken to mediate the escalating violence of the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars which claimed many more lives than what Bulger and Flemmi have been accused of taking. It is unlikely that action against Connolly, Flemmi and Bulger will effect any long term solution, as the system their organization perpetuated has strong buy in at the highest levels of government. Going after these 3 is like a company firing an executive to quench the public thirst for vengeance, but the organization itself perpetuates with new players. There are many many more individuals such as Flemmi and Bulger in the area and which have not gotten anywhere near the heat these guys have. They have been listed in local newspapers.And there has been a much stronger link between organized crime and law enforcement than one might suspect. Organized crime may actually help law enforcement by breaking down geographical regions into empires of control and holding those organized crime groups accountable, thus minimizing random crime."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"An individual with an ambiguous family history at best was thrown into upheaval when this came to light. Consider this and decide if it is a coincidence:1)The man, as a boy,had a state social worker bearing the name of a female FBI agent listed in \\"Black Mass\\"2) The man,as a boy, was assigned a social security number under a state-licensed, former federal official3) The man was befriended by a number of individuals who appeared to be gathering evidence and documenting while playing the role of \\"friends\\" and whose activities stepped up and at times became inexplicably hostile immediately following Bulger's disappearance.Anomalies triggered by media coverage of Bulger-related material began to appear with regularity in the man's life. The probing of these 'friends' appeared centered on establishing veracity(asking questions they already new answers to without any obvious explanation for having the information- to see if that individual's responses were truthful, and specific facts, such as if they were out for lunch, what the PRECISE bill was and PRECISE tip was(as if conducting an accounting investigation or using information to complete an expense form)4) If these \\"friends\\" happened to be over that person's home or vice-versa, the friends would leave lights on in strange patterns (signaling someone outside and nearby), or need consistently minimum periods of time prior to the individual's arrival, as if preparing recording equipment or other related activities5) Strong evidence of a network of individuals separately introduced but commonly linked to the individual and handing off as handlers among them of the individual while relaying info received from the individual among themselves for corresponding adverse activity6) Many of the \\"friends\\" having geographical links to the Boston FBI office and satellite RAs in Mass. and New Hampshire and in close proximity to spheres of influence of William Bulger7) A whole host of former acquaintances disappearing and re-appearing in the individual's life using names other than they had been introduced with before, as if having access to readily available means to change their identities8)Indicators of long term roving surveillance and interference with communications of the individual, progressively cutting the individual off from being able to contact others by phone or computer ie making that person 'disappear'9) The individual having no criminal history or apparent reason to be under massive long term government scrutiny10) The individual went for medical treatment for one condition and the appointed doctor began treating for mental illness without explanation. The individual stopped seeing the doctor and later it was learned that doctor was a forensic consultant to varied law enforcement agencies and possibly the federal government. Later, a \\"friend\\" of the individual began claiming mental health issues while seeing several simultaneous counselors. Following conversations between individual and \\"friend\\",\\"friend\\" would act in such a way as if coached in behavior modification strategies by mental health professionals as well as coached by third parties in setting the agendas for future discussions in evidence/documenting collection.11) A \\"friend\\" introduced 3 years prior to Bulger's disappearance announces 10 years AFTER Bulger's disappearance that he has been keeping notebooks on individual."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"What I like best about this book, is that it's about my town: Boston. I love learning stuff like this. To me, Boston is just a city, but this book gives it history and shows that places I've walked by a million times really have a dark side to them. Boston is a historical town, sure, but this book shines a light on the evil that is here, that the common man like myself never sees or thinks about! I'm not done yet, but I like it very much so far.-The writing is a bit heavy - sometimes I have to read a passage several times in order to get who is doing what to whom, and how they fit into the big picture. It can be a bit much at times, but overall you get the idea: good guy, bad guy, good guy becoming bad. That sums it up!-I've finished the book. It's a bit much. There's a LOT to take in that I ended up forgetting quite a bit. The author(s) were a bit confusing. The book isn't told in chronological order, rather it jumps around with different stories in an attempt to give the book some cohesiveness. It can be confusing at times, but overall I get the jist of it. Not the easiest read, but certainly interesting."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There is much contradiction in the newspaper accounts in this case. In addition, Charles Prouty wrote a letter to the editor suggesting that publishing newspaper articles with information that may be relevant to the case could be construed as obstruction of justice. Recently former state trooper Schneiderhan, who retired with an excellent reputation as n investigator and who also worked for the Attorney General's office, was arrested for allegedly leaking wiretap information to Bulger.In this case, several individuals have taken the fall defending Bulger or their joint activities. O'Neill pledged his home for bail and Flemmi has not had access to his financial resources to mount a complete defense. The degree of heat that Connolly, O'Neill ,Flemmi and now Schneiderhan are willing to accept is commendable and makes you wonder if there is a lot more going here than meets the eye. If these guys were Bulger's associates and friends, how is Bulger coping knowing that they are taking this much heat? Before anyone can cast judgement it might be wise to hold back until,if ever, we hear Whitey's point of view. Recently the Mass. state police and DEA have expressed strong interest in being included in the FBI's investigation of Bulger at every step. No one has asked the question: what if Flemmi and Bulger were mandated to protect someone or a group of people?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"..that fills in the gaps! Take this case of a young man sucked up in this mess and see if it meshes with this book,which is a good read and very informative...The man was employed professionally and around the time Whitey split town was suddenly fired. Just before this an attractive woman had befriended him at Northeastern University, linked also to R Robert Popeo and Agent John Morris. When the man was fired the woman started suddenly taking mysterious trips and acting in a manner suggestive of infidelity while alleging marriage intentions. Before each mystery trip the man was treated with special kindness, as if to assuage guilt over the emotional betrayal soon to follow. This man had as a socil worker a woman who went by the name of a female FBI agent mentioned in Lehr's work on this topic. After Whitey fled, his prior employers blackballed him on job references and his car was tampered with a la Eddie Moiano. IRS audits and levies soon followed as well as sudden bank deposit discrepancies at Fleet Bank, which also harbored IRS accounts at the time. In addition the man's phone line indicated third party interception and screening. As part of this process, the man was called on job interviews which appeared to be nothing more than pretense interviews to gather information or desired evidence on the man. For example, the man was called to a software company offering real-time monitoring and messaging capability such as for chats.When he got there no one knew him or why he was there; but a waist level camera pointed down at him seated in the reception area garnered his photo. Prior to the interview, the man had received overlaid spiteful messages during online chats visible only to him- an alleged capability of this software.At other companies videos were made of him or handwriting samples obtained. Following the alleged fiancee, several other women with similar behavior patterns emerged while new male friends appeared on the scene indicating later after a befriending period that they had kept notebooks on the man or had watched him go to the health club,do banking etc. The man had no criminal history and did not know any principles in the Bulger case but was later informed by these suspicious new friends that he was to blame for the Bulger fiasco. Dan Burton was unavilable for comment on the man during the congressional hearings.The man received threatening and harassing calls but local police were unable to help. Why all of this? Prior to all this, the man had been featured in a local newspaper story detailing his search for who his father was and all the obstacles stemming from that."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Some questions one might ask in this case: 1) Have any federal/state personnel in Massachusetts/NH been sanctioned formally or informally to use any children Bulger might have as bait to aid in his capture or to punish the children because the father is gone? 2) Did Bulger have a child employed by a TEMPEST site contractor who has been blackballed throughout MA/NH industry through government contacts with industry in the region even though such a child might not be aware of their background? 3) If any state or federal officials are using children of Bulger against him, is there an effort underway to also conceal the fact this is going on through pretense efforts?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"The same government we are now entrusting broad wiretapping, electronic surveillance, roving warrants and the like to is the same one we criticize so sternly in this case.

This shows that confidentiality cannot be maintained by government or law enforcement personnel nor so called &quot;confidential&quot; tip sources as tv law enforcement shows.

Prior to this time the kid was placed in many abusive homes, one of which may have been linked to a well known escort service owner in Massachusetts. As a matter of fact, many of the people associated with this child have indirect ties to major brothels and escort operators in the area.

Around this time i knew an individual who became a target of increased threats and harassment against themselves and others around them. Their friends started acting nervous or afraid and backed off, as if being intimidated. The people doing the harassing alleged links to different individuals prolific in state politics. This person went to the authorities and was blown off by the FBI and told by the Justice Dept that they do not speak to ordinary citizens and to get a lawyer.Later the person requested copies of any files that either may have on them and was told either the agency was 'too busy' or claimed ignorance about any such contacts. The experience lends additional credence to claims by the Litif family, Barretts,Mcintyre families. The day after Schneiderhan was busted this person was approached by an angry, official looking person looking for incriminating information.

A serviceman is said to have testified before Congress that 20% of the backpressure relief valves were installed backwards in the Thresher and that the hull of the Thresher was crushed at a time when the Portsmouth and Boston navy yards may have been competing for funds.

Current and future FBI agents at this very moment might be making decisions that will land them too in the position Rico and Connolly are in.A concern in this case is that much information has been lost,witnesses are dead and security restrictions in place that may bar Rico and others from fully disclosing the particulars.Another curious item is that the FBI has not established its own anonymous lead source.Former Governor Paul Cellucci is responsible for releasing Salvati."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I know someone who communicated with the Justice Management Division after attempts to get help from the Boston and Lowell/Lawrence Mass.

About a year later, some of the person's mail stopped coming at their apartment. A short time later, some military police came to arrest the individual claiming they were AWOL from the military. This person was not in the military. As the person found out, across town was another person with the exact same name. When calling organizations from which the person (&quot;John Doe#1&quot;) had not gotten mail, those organizations had the second man's(&quot;John Doe #2&quot;) address. So John Doe #2 was using this person's address for military service and knew enough about the person to contact organizations that person did business with and have their mail forwarded to the second address. 5 yrs later, when William Weld is said to have headed the Justice Dept criminal investigation division (Mueller-FBI and Judge Mark Wolf as subordinates) and Mike Dukakis was governor.,John Doe#1 was working at a local company and received an incoming customer call for another coworker. In taking a message, it was John Doe #2 who said they lived a few towns over.

These approaches usually involve intimidation or extortion with the deliverers claiming FBI affiliation in the Merrimack Valley region of northern Massachusetts which includes a regional FBI office outside of the Boston office.Has the Defense Investigative Service and FBI teamed up to squeeze a child of Bulger or a close friend of Bulger's to keep Bulger away?Are Whitey Bulger and Flemmi's names being smeared to bringclosure to their roles in a covert operation?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book reads well and is interesting but the reader might want to have more info.The Government reform committee headed by Congress might want to investigate linkage between this case and Judge Sartorelli of Middlesex County, Massachusetts and also research agents Weafer and Driscoll and other Justice Dept personnel in Middlesex county of the 1960s/1970s, as many of the players here are located in Middlesex county."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Here is a fascinating topic of recent interest which the authors seem to have spent a lot of time researching. Unfortunately, one gets the feeling they did not spend much time writing it.It is always difficult for multiple authors to write a cohesive narrative. In this case, the reader sometimes feels (s)he is talking to a forgetful party guest who keeps telling the same joke or story. The same incident is brought up several times as though it were the first, probably a result of duplicated effort among the authors combined with poor editing. Likely the publisher was in a hurry to get the book out while the topic was still current.Some of the writing is just plain silly. &quot;Bulger was the head on Connolly's glass of beer.&quot; Even if that means something -- and I will never be convinced of that -- it does not contribute to my understanding of the case.The Bulger/Flemmi case could be the basis for a really great book, and I hope someday it will be. This is just a Boston Globe story that is much too long."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"O'Neill and Lehr have written an extremely compelling tale of double-cross, deception, and morality. It's main characters are men in positions of power who have neither conscience or compassion and the supposed good guys are, in many ways, worse than the bad. Obviously gangsters like Whitey Bulger and Stevie Flemmi were violent, amoral criminals; but to find out that FBI agents like John Connolly were lurking in the shadows protecting them and manipulating everybody else will make even the most cynical reader feel outraged and frustrated. It is a courageous and, at times, disturbing story that will test your own conscience and force you to ask the question: who are we really supposed to trust? Great read!"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Early in this case, defendants brought up the fact that the Justice Dept had compiled files on them but would not release contents or summaries of those files to the defendants. Perhaps a strategy used by the govt is to target an individual, harass them to the degree that they seek law enforcement help or protection, then use the info they provide not only forlaw enforcement intelligence, but as leverage later when they can hold this information over the head of the persons seeking law enforcement help who then may be branded a 'rat'.Perhaps a similar thing happened in the case of Flemmi and Bulger.This case also raises questions when you consider that the Justice Dept with all of its prosecutorial powers also oversees the Bureau of Prisons. The FBI investigates itself and the Justice Dept, it's boss, via the Office of Professional Responsibility.The CIA and NSA also appear to police themselves. This case is so complex and the mandate given to Bulger and Flemmi so unclear that it is extremely difficult to determine who had authority for what. It does not seem possible that a small group comprised of Connolly,Bulger,Flemmi,Mercurio,Morris were able to perpetuate the organization alleged for nearly 3 decades with the Justice Dept powerless to stop them.It is also disturbing that fellow agents have distanced themselves and left this group holding the bag alone. It is not to exonerate the group but to say that the responsibility is shared and the executives up top should have the conviction to do what is right. Also, in the Puzzle Palace by James Bamford it discusses how NSA had prospective employees agree in writing that they would obey the law in their personal lives , but does not say that they must in their professional lives. Another interesting work is &quot;Underground Empire&quot; by James Mills, which discusses a highly secretive pseudo-organization known as Centac, which had a mandate of destroying criminal empires from the top. Also, we do not know much about the recruitment of Flemmi and Bulger.. once recruited whether as informants or govt agents say as Bulger (a former Air Force veteran) or Flemmi (Army paratrooper) these individuals become assets of the govt and are tracked accordingly by social security number,etc and their lives heavily monitored by security components of the agencies for which they work."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"One of the things Congressman Burton should investigate is how tips were handled by America's Most Wanted and whether any of them were withheld or leaked.

One of the people i had known for 2 decades and was rabidly anti-Bulger. I found myself surrounded by people who had some feeling one way or another about the Bulger case and it was mixed between pro-FBI and pro-Bulger forces. This schism was so pronounced i wonder if the Bulger case actually involves the 2 major political parties in the U.S.and this is why there is so much gridlock.One person affected by this whole mess was allegedly targeted by individuals claiming to have ties to the Nh department of justice and possibly other local FBI offices in the area. Were these real agents or agent provocateurs?Was the Defense Investigative Service,DIA or other agencies involved? Is Congress capable of doing anything if they are?Did the state or regional federal agencies within the state back Whitey? Have other branches of the Justice Department or other agencies protected Bulger from the FBI or has the FBI done it? Could Bulger be being protected on the possibility he really did NOT do all that is alleged and what is going on is a lynching?Is this a planned reorganization of the government itself taking shape as a series of scandalous triggers which will cause disbanding of the agency?

The authors' investigative reporting goes deep, uncovering the gang's criminal activities as well as their unholy pact with the FBI. This book lacks the personal notes found in others written by various gang members, but it more than makes up for it with solid reporting that shows the scope and outrageousness of the gang's operations. My only criticism is that it could use an update covering what's happened to the major players since its publication."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Black Mass is an unbelievable account of the illicit relationship between two Irish mobsters from South Boston (Whitey Bulger and Stevie Flemmi) and their FBI handlers (John Connolly and John Morris).The book begins with background on South Boston and the \\"us against them\\" mentality of the residents. As a young boy, John Connolly looked up to and admired Whitey Bulger, a local gangster, and left an indelible impression on Connolly one day when Bulger rescued Connolly from a fight. Years later, when Connolly was assigned to the Boston FBI office, he sought out Bulger to turn him into an informant, hoping to make a name for himself. Bulger's younger brother was president of the state senate and Whitey by this time was head of the Irish mob in Boston, both highly regarded in their own circles.Though Connolly may have begun the relationship with good intentions, it very quickly turned corrupt, and the information Bulger supplied Connolly was self-serving, and Connolly, never having grown out of his idolization of Bulger, did all he could to keep Whitey's record clean. The Irish and Italian mafias had a tenuous relationship, so for Bulgur, informing on his competition got them out of his way, and as long as he worked with the FBI, he was untouchable. Bulger's partner in crime, Stevie Flemmi, as it turned out, had been an informant for several years before Bulger. Rather than the FBI handling them, Bulger and Flemmi cultivated a bond with Connolly and Morris to ensure that they could do anything without fear of punishment. Reports were made up, lost, or taken; phone calls from other law enforcement agencies were ignored; Bulger and Flemmi's importance was inflated; and they were always one step ahead of a sting. Under the protection of the FBI, Bulger and Flemmi were involved in racketeering, gun running, drugs, and over a dozen murders - and got away with it.What amazes me is that supposedly Connolly and Morris only benefited by $7000 during the two decades that Bulger and Flemmi were informants. Initially I believe that Connolly just wanted notoriety, but he is also flamboyant and likes living the high life, which it appears he did.Eventually Morris' conscience bothered him enough to start talking, but it still took several years before Bulger, Flemmi, Connolly and Morris were indicted. Connolly warned Bulger, enabling him to escape. Flemmi, on the other hand, still thought that Morris would tell the court that this was all a mistake, and get Flemmi off as he had done for so many years.As far as I know, Bulger is still a fugative and on the 10 Most Wanted List. I hope that regulations are now being followed to ensure FBI handlers are accountable for their action or inaction, and that the chain of command is aware of what the agents are doing. This was a well-written and engrossing story."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is a fantastic book. I knew nothing of the true story, so I found every twist and turn very entertaining. It is well written and doesn't get too bogged down in gritty detail. I read about 2-3 books a month and this ranks near the top of ones I've read in 2003.The story is very interesting, but the strength is in it's characters. Whitey, Flemmi, Connolly, etc. all have their moments. I found myself many times thinking to myself, I cannot believe this. But it's true, scary in fact. It has all the elements of a great movie, and I'm surprised that it hasn't been adapted already. It has Scorsese all over it.The authors give you a good taste of life in South Boston and of course expose a criminal decade or two that was aided by the FBI. This isn't conspiracy theory stuff, btw. Agents in the FBI protected their star informants, giving them tips, covering up information, that allowed them to stay on the street and supposedly bust others.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is an excellent book on the Boston Irish mob figure whitey bulger. Almost everyone else that has something to do with the case has been caught and tried, including FBI agent John Connally. Whitey became an informant for the FBI by Connnally's persausion, but he was overratted and used the FBI to strengthen his position while Steve Flemmi's information was more valuable. They informed on the the Italian mafia, but the Angulio's were taken down more due to wire tap evidence. Whitey and his gang became the benefactors of the fall of the Angulio's and pick up some of their business after their fall. Whitey was also a drug dealer, not protector of South Boston. Will he ever get caught? It remains to be seen, and with his resources he could run a long way for a long time."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book was the first book to be written on the Bulger/FBI scandal. For those who don't know; James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger ran Bostons Irish mafia for almost 20 years. He also was a Top Echelon Informant for the FBI. As such, they let him get away with all types of crimes, including murder. Making matters worse, his younger brother Billy was the Senate president of the Mass. state Senate. Another brother, Jackie, was a juvenile court judge. This family took corruption to new heights. Eventually they fell. Whitey is now one of the top 10 fugitives. This book by two Boston Globe reporters, details the Bulger brothers, their history, Boston politics, and how they all came together. This is a good book. The only problems are because it was written in 1998-1999, some things have changed ( For example, Bulgers partner in crime, Steven Flemi, has pleaded guilty to several murders, and is doing life without parole ). Also, there wasn't enough written about the Top Echelon Informant program and all the problems with it. I'd recomend getting 2 other books along with this to get a complete picture. 1 is Dangerous Alliances by Ralph Ranelli; the other is The Brothers Bulger by Howie Carr. All 3 books should give you a complete view of this scandal."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Speaking as a recent Boston transplant amd a fan of O.C. stories this book is awesome. Boston, for those who are unfamiliar, really is a &quot;little&quot; big city....For me its hard to imagine that the politics and crime that is closely linked in this book could happen as recently as it did. As a story it is a compeling read.This book may not be as action filled as other Mafia books, however, as a atory of real life corruption and journalistic detail it can hardly be surpassed."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"It is easy to focus on Bulger,Flemmi &amp; Connolly in this case and all the allegations might be true...we just don't know until all the facts are out. There is something disturbing though about how Flemmi has been held in prison for years without a trial and before being convicted. This should send chills up anyone's spine and it is disturbing that no one seems bothered by this. The govt has made a reasonable argument he might be a flight risk but how can it justify holding the man in solitary confinement for so long and in prison for years awaiting trial? Isn't this sort of hedging where the govt gets the prison time up front even though a conviction has not been had? Others in this case went through the same thing and finally plea bargained and are doing time. Some of the tactics being used in this case may very well support the defendant's assertions.These points are not about exonerating Bulger,Flemmi and Connolly this is about basic justice for anyone,Say a mistake was made and you were arrested on serious charges and you were held in prison for years without a trial-- how would you feel?Also some of the individuals brought in during the hearings testified about the probability of corruption in the FBI going back 2-3 decades but these individuals were speaking about it sometimes years after leaving the FBI or Justice Dept and might suggest these people knew what was going on at the time it was going on.Does this add legitimacy to Connolly and Flemmi's arguments?Only a very few know for certain whether Flemmi,Connolly and Bulger are guilty of all alleged. A question that emerges in this is will ALL the facts come out and is the justice dept and fbi committed to the truth? The truth might be all that is alleged but as recent presidential election and supreme court concerns have developed, faith and trust in the integrity of our govt institutions is as much on trial as these guys are.As american citizens we want to trust our govt but so many times in the past the govt has let us down. The responsibility of people in the FBI,Justice Dept and any such agency is awesome and those employed are held to a higher standard. It must not be easy but the cost is so very high if they do not."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Black Mass is basically a story about allegations of abuse of law enforcement authority. This is as ancient as law itself. In Eusebius' 'History of the Church', he details how Roman soldiers would go disguised as a member of the crowd to hear early Christians preach.Once at the rally, these soldiers fomented a riot then brutally beat and imprisoned supporters. many people were killed in brutal ways simply because they wanted to embrace this new religion. Law enforcement is necessary but where do we draw the line? Even someone such as Jesus could not escape the laws of the day and we know what happened there.There are monsters out in the world but not everyone is one. Governments around the world create agencies and bodies designed to protect their own and destroy the 'enemy'but once creating these agencies how can they prevent them from running rampant against their own? Governments around the world throw people in prison to punish and then wonder why they are not 'better' when they get out. It seems that much of the crime that happens might well be preventable if we look at root socioeconomic causes that often can be traced back to policy and legislation changes. Perhaps if we worked at taking care of people using private and public resources aimed at developing self-sufficiency and job skills and provision of basic needs(food,shelter,safety) the percentage of crime might go way down."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book discusses the Bulger case as if the alleged activities within are new. They are not new..in fact, it seems that the government and the mafia are direct competitors for the same markets with former govt employees joining ranks with organized crime to help protect these ventures. Former Agent Yacobucci was listed in the Boston Herald as helping finance strip joints up and down the east coast. If one could go into state records and see the demographics of kids in state care, this might also point to a system in place which promotes some of these ventures by creating a captive population to exploit by the sex and sex fantasy trades and much more. If former govt agents are permitted to delve into such businesses, knowing that many of the individuals who get into these activities are victims of dysfunctional families,broken homes and a variety of abuse, then this shows a tacit approval on the part of govt officials to perpetuate a system which preys on the innocent. The difference here in the US is how much window dressing conceals the harsh reality. There are many things going on which suggest that one must enter into govt in some form to have broad freedoms unavailable to the ordinary working man. Former President George Bush was Director of the CIA before his presidency, Yacobucci was a former FBI agent before entering the strip club business, Flemmi and Bulger had military backgrounds. Could it perhaps be that there is a tier system in America based on security clearances and once one has attained a certain level one becomes immune to normal laws and standards? By reaching a certain clearance this puts one into a pool where all sorts of things, legal and illegal, become possible? Is this system outside the scope of the law,even the US Supreme Court?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"No one should be shocked by this book. There is a certain gritty reality in this story which many of us know intuitively but feel powerless to address. Can crime and morality be controlled fully by any one body? Prohibition did not work and it seems the real answer lies in a spiritual,ethical and moral evolution that contradicts the social darwinism we see rising each day around the world. Prostitution is a global issue masked by innocuous business names,SIC codes and discreet financial arrangements that serve needs that may originate from dysfunctional relationship formation. Drugs are seen as pain avoidance mechanisms no less legitimate than caffeine or tobacco or nutritional supplements but are no cure and perhaps the real issue that needs addressing is how much people will resort to this temporary fix to escape a perceived unhappy life. Why are so many people seeking escape from their environment? Can we honestly deal with that? Extortion is a simple extension of social darwinism and survival of the fittest. Murder for hire is said to originate with the concept of retribution and the reduction of human life to whatever dollar value such markets bear.Some may see it as the concept of 'eye for an eye' carried to its most extreme conclusion. So perhaps knowing Prohibition didnt work,the govt has been left having to manage such things to an acceptable level of risk.It might be akin to a company stating it has zero tolerance for product defects but knowing that such a goal is not practically attainable over the long haul and there will always be some statistically unacceptable output."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"From a management point of view we all know that government has an extraordinarily difficult time with the process of &quot;Control&quot;.

Len was released to his mother whom he did not recognize as such and no father was known or present. At 'home', Len was sexually and physically abused, tortured, had the home essentially burn down, and witnessed his mother attempt suicide or her husband attempt to murder her several times. Sometimes Len had to go to a local fire station, still a crippled boy, to get help for his mother overdosed on drugs and booze.Len was taken into state care where he was further beaten, ridiculed,humiliated, bounced around,and repeatedly separated from newly made friends. Education was choppy but adequate and some 'caring' individuals came into his life on public or nonprofit payrolls. Many of these individuals later were found to have connections to this case and to change their attitude towards Len to a hostile tone.Eventually Len ran away from a hard labor camp breaking granite boulders simply because he had no home.At this time, it was a state sponsored program at the height of Bulger and Flemmi's power.As Bill Weld left the Justice Dept to become Governor of Massachusetts, Len was hit and run and left. He was later approached by alleged government officials attached to a Woburn company and intimidated while his home was broken into successive times and 'strange' phone calls became a regular occurrence no matter how much he change the number.Before Bulger vanished Len had asked who his father is and this seemed to bring the wrath not only of close friends who became increasingly incensed by this case, but the government too.

Will these hearings be about as effective as the IRS hearings were? In the end analysis, Congress has little authority of oversight.Former trooper Schneiderhan asserts that the whole investigation is a joke, and one might question this when one considers that this case spilled open in 1995 and it has been nearly 6.5 years. If one assumes say $200,000 spent each year, then $1.3 million has been spent so far just on investigating Whitey, not including costs of a state investigation. From a third party perspective it seems there are investigators all over, some of whom are blocking the efforts of others. The primary focus seems to be that Flemmi and Bulger were rogue,but this might be simply diverting from a harsher truth.The money for sex business has its own SIC codes,porno movies come with a compliance statement right at the opening of the movie showing that the producers have followed federal guidelines in their production. The 'war' on drugs is no war, so the government manages drugs,assuring neither too many drugs get in nor that there is too much clamping down,the premise being that it is a problem that really cannot be solved without fascist tactics. One can argue whether it is a supply-side or demand-side issue. There is a fine line between morality and legality.One area not investigated much here is the use of psychological warfare to cast doubt on credibility of witnesses or in the Bulger case to fuel existing paranoia that is not completely unfounded given the parties and reputations involved. Bulger is credited with being a serial liar but consider this: if you were being monitored by multiple agents of multiple agencies who are gathering information on you and comparing it without your knowledge or ability to refute or defend and for whom you are supposed to be working, what would you do? And because these agents can operate in anonymity you can only guess who they are, so this puts the person in the position of incriminating themselves without being apprised of the consequences."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"A prosecutor is supposed to seek justice, not just prove guilt. One thing to be concerned with here is whether leads in the investigation are fully considered, even if the leads do not support the prosecutor's assertions. If the investigators in the Bulger case received tips contrary to allegations put forth against Bulger and Flemmi and Connolly would those tips be followed up? How do we know that tip sources such as the media or television crime shows generate leads that investigators will follow up?There is a case of one person who went to the Justice Department when this case broke and who had come under heavy fire for reasons unknown. The Justice Department redacted some of the correspondence and never provided feedback while the harassers showed evidence of in depth knowledge of this correspondence. Later the individual requested a copy of any records they had and met with stonewalling by the department. The individual did not know if they were being held under some form of investigation, as the attackers seemed quite anxious about the unfolding of the Bulger investigation.This scenario might be a warning to any who might consider becoming an informant. For nearly 3 decades Flemmi and Bulger served law enforcement and now they and their families and friends are being destroyed systematically as former associates crumble under pressure and cut deals. There are a lot of allegations about these guys and incriminating testimony and evidence but the full story is not told. As Salemme, Weeks, Nee,Martorano and perhaps others now become informants, they might one day end up like Flemmi and Bulger, once praised and now condemned."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"That is a key question in this scenario.The recent release from prison after 30 years of Peter Limone is a case FOR the use of informants such as used in this case. If not for a report from an unidentified informant exonerating him from murder, Limone would still be in prison. On the flip side, we do not know how credible this unnamed informant was. If the integrity of the informant is high, Limone truly got screwed and some recompense is surely in order.Another disturbing tactic is how the DEA allegedly entered the vehicles of Bulger and Flemmi and planted various bugs in their vehicles. It is alleged that the FBI planted a fake bomb on a car of one man to make him think the Mafia was trying to kill him in order to make him an informant. So we have 2 agencies that will not hesitate to tamper with someone's car.. how far will they go?Held wholly unaccountable in this case is the CIA,which is alleged to have contributed to Bulger's maturing use as a government asset. Some time ago there was a newspaper release that the CIA approached the Mafia about subcontracting an assassination. Prior to the public release, anyone who promulgated that view may have been labeled &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.What should terrify any ordinary citizen is the prospect of these all-powerful agencies running amok and without external oversight. It is unlikely that low level employees are ultimately responsible for straying from the noble mandate but the mangement of these agencies ,which decides the use of resources,targets, and long term agenda for the agency.It is unlikely that Flemmi will be able to offer insightful testimony as he is progressively being worn down and broken down by seclusion, fear, and being a 'patsy'. Individuals are all but having murders and other serious crimes forgiven all for the sake of getting Flemmi, Bulger, Connolly,Rico."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"It seems reasonable that the informants in this case and perhaps even Connolly were set up by their own agency or a combination of agencies. I worked for a company with heavy govt contracts.During the screening and clearance phase i was encouraged to discharge my debts through bankruptcy or possibly be excluded from the job. After i had done so, i was forced to sign a statement saying i would never file bankruptcy again. I was told i would be monitored but not how, for how long, or to what extent. After being cleared i was 'promoted' to a new position and was led to believe the monitoring was over. How wrong i was. In my new position it became apparent early on that my new promotion was a fall guy position. I was expendable because i had no family that would be harmed when i went down. Mired in controversy, i was laid off from my position and this is when i began to bear what seemed to be the wrath of the govt. A whole gamut of harassment,character assassination, threats,intimidation began. Almost every conceivable attack was made against me and no employer would touch me. Individuals began entering my life some of whom i suspect were govt agents keeping tabs on me or to gather dirt and ammunition to later use against me.I began having job interviews with what may have been govt agents posing as legitimate interviewers who issued thinly veiled threats or promises of employment or the lack thereof. I know firsthand some of the tactis of the govt and i find it quite plausible that the govt will do anything possible to silence people like Flemmi, Bulger or Connolly i have had this happen to me."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"How many people were exonerated by information provided by these and other informants?

How do we know that the communications among the informants weren't such that their movements were monitored by the govt and arrangements made to influence prospective employers or references used by these guys?And could it be that the informants were indeed told they could commit crimes with FBI protection but that this was simply a setup to see if they actually would and so validate FBI suspicions?How do we know that the social relationships surrounding these guys were not carefully orchestrated to ensure ongoing monitoring of the informants?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There are many questions this book raises: 1) Were these informants drafted into service using obscure Selective Service regulations?, 2)Were these informants,agents,and their families constantly manipulated in their personal associations by govt agents from other branches posing as friends and allies?,3)Was some of the money raised in these operations funneled into corporations or political campaigns? 4) Did some of the parties involved in this case have children raised in Massachusetts child care and who were used as leverage against the informants? 5) What if Flemmi and Bulger did not do all these things but are being used as scapegoats by the govt and/or organized crime?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There is something very curious about this case. Consider the plight of a man who was a small child when Flemmi first appeared in the Top Echelon program:The child was treated out of state and lived in a hospital bed for over 2 years straight with no visitors,no known family and no definitive diagnosis until just before release. One of the procedures performed was the same as a bone marrow transplant and other tests performed also pointed to leukemia. Of government sponsored studies, only 3 children matched this child with diagnosis of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head and also wore the Patten brace and orthotics. This child had no social security number during the treatment nor was a number knowingly assigned to the child as that switched guardianship hands for the next 5 years following years after release from the hospital. In the early 1970s, a former army official attached to the Pentagon during Vietnam (Flemmi was army)arranged for the boy to have a social security number. Prior to meeting this official the boy had a large number of state foster families with a particular Italian family in Burlington,Mass among the most abusive.In 1993-94, the boy had a news article published detailing his quest for his father and the expense and ultimate disappointment in learning the man he was told was the father was not. About 2 years or so after the article a large article appeared in the Boston Globe detailing how Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) could be used to determine leukemia by the existence of minimal residual leukemia cells.On further investigation, the boy(now a man) learned this technique was used in his test. Additionally, consultation with the first expert witness in DNA fingerprinting in the U.S. revealed that the only thing that can throw this test is a bone marrow transplant, which was done in the early 1960s and the procedure for doing so is consistent with procedures performed on the boy.In 1995 this man worked for WR Grace in a capacity to prevent the kind of pollution that tragically occurred in Woburn 4-5 decades ago. On release of Harr's book \\"A Civil Action\\" he was summoned to an Executive's office and told he was part of a \\"layoff\\" for \\"cost reductions\\". The layoff ultimately consisted of 1 person. The man knew little of the Woburn case and had a largely concealed family history in state records that even the likes of Ted Kennedy,Nick Paleologos, and many more could not reveal. For the next few years the man had a succession of job interviews in which he was grilled by the interviewers about the role Grace played in the Woburn case and the interviewers claimed to know parties in the case. In each interview case the man never got the job. While this went on, the man's medical records began disappearing, and an EPA official the man had been introduced to told him\\" good luck finding work\\". Several years before, the man had been called into a Grace managers office with ties to Woburn and informed that if he didn't take a specific job his future was dead with Grace or anywhere else. The man also found himself maneuvered into certain jobs where he suddenly became the target for much harassment because it was thought he had something to do with Harr's book, of which he didn't.Grace has been historically a very Republican company, and the man suddenly began having problems at Fleet Bank, a supporter of gubernatorial candidate Paul Cellucci who has been linked to George Cashman who has been linked to John Connolly in the Bulger case. Most recently the man was told he had 7 days to leave where he was staying by a relative of a Grace executive. Additionally, an associate who had been introduced to the man as a child had ties to a key political supporter of Cellucci with enormous ties to the employment market in the area which became closed off to the man. And when Cellucci moved to Canada, a mysterious phone call from Ottawa came the same day. Before this ,roommates of the man described workmen doing something at the telephone pole outside the apartment that the telephone company later had no work orders for. Pen registers courtesy of the FBI?From 1995 on there was a succession of people remerging from the man's past whom had been introduced by different names when he was a boy than they now carry. In at least one case one such individual suggested that they had made 'mistakes' but ' know how to cover them up'. Since this book came out associates known to the man for decades in some cases suddenly switched demeanor and it became apparent that when the man contacted those \\"friends\\" that the phone conversations were being steered to elicit specific responses perhaps for legal purposes and perhaps recorded without the mans knowledge or permission.It appeared as a significant number of individuals knew something about this man he had never been told so as to protect themselves.That man,because of a withheld family history, has had to suffer long term homelessness,joblessness( on a scale way beyond explanation for the general economic trends of the past 6-7 years), the loss of old 'friends' and nearly every personal possession over and over again while growing up as a child bounced place to place.The man's whole life has been essentially taking one beating after another for events that preceded him and of which he was not a cognizant participant.The man has been referred to in prior reviews."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"If you have read the news accounts over the last few years don't bother purchasing.

You know you should stop reading but you can't pull your eyes away from the page, it's like a car accident, you know you shoudn't look but....After awhile though your mind regains its focus and your mind rebels. you just gotta go whaaattt? The thesis of the book is John Connolly, FBI agent, has a man crush on James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger because Bulger bought him ice cream as a child and later saved him from a beat down on a baseball field. Because of this and their common origin in South Boston, Connolly obstructs justice and single handedly blocks every and all investigations in Bulger and his cronies. In doing so he throws away a career and does hard time.This is pretty hard for anyone who ever had a job and a hard nosed boss to believe. Imagine the scene, the hurley burly of FBI head quarters in Boston, agents scurry about investigating UFO's, spies, and procuring the super strong coffee needed for those 25 hour days. The phone rings on agent Connolly desk:\\"Connolly FBI\\"\\"John this is Home Base, the Big House, the Central Power...\\"\\"Ma?\\"\\"No, no, not your mother, this Is FBI headqurters in Washington D.C. We want you to investigate Whitey Bolger\\"\\"Whitey?! Whitey Bolger, git on wif ye, surin ye knew he's a grand man. Why wood ya be pressin on 'im\\"\\"We have reason to believe he is a bad man\\"\\"Sure I can tell ya he's not, he's an upstandin fella. Bought me ice cream when I was a wee bairn\\"\\"What?!\\"\\"Well....it was vanella if ye want to know. He ulso pullled that fat day go kid off in me.....\\"\\"Connolly, this is agent Antonelli, investigate him anyway.\\"\\"OK\\"*Connolly Hangs up phone and ignores orders*Well, if you buy the premise of this book as absurd as the above conversation is you have to believe in something close to it (authors also pepper the work with the casual prejudice of the Boston Brahmans, the Irish of South Boston are portrayed as poorly educated reactionaries unaware of their own best interests). To buy the premise the authors proceed from you have to believe the FBI is so inept that a mid level functionary can shutdown the organization by basically holding his breath and saying, \\"No!\\" If true the national security of the United States is compromised as our national police force is inept. This is not believable, what is believable is massive corruption in the local office of which Connolly and Morris were a part of; this is established later in the book when authors reveal in a rather off hand and cavalier way that seventeen other agents are indicted for corruption! Kind of puts the sword to the proposition Connolly and Morris obstructed, it seems the whole office was in on it! Why then did the authors not re-think or re-postulate their story in light of these facts?I don't know. Perhaps laziness, maybe ineptitude.Regardless, what's even more unbelievable is the authors seeming obliviousness to the fact that Bolgers continued freedom (in spite of an alleged 15 year world wide manhunt by the FBI) belies their premise for the book. After all, after removing the obstruction to Bolgers arrest, Bolgers arrest would be sure to follow.Right?Why then has he remained free for 15 years? Is he so clever the FBI and all the other national police forces in the world can't find him? Hard to believe. Real hard. Maybe the truth is the FBI doesn't want him? I wonder, \\"Why would that be?\\" Perhaps important powerful people either in or out of the FBI would be compromised by his arrest? If so, Connolly doesn't know who they are, he would of given them up to save himself, therefore they're only safe as long as Bolger is free. This makes sense. The book doesn't.p.s. Well, they finally got Bulger, seems the bodybuilder was living in Venice Beach; who would of thought? *Rolls eyes* I can't wait to hear this guy talk.p.p.s. Well, it's been 6 months since Bolger was arrested, no news. You'ld think 16 years would of been plenty of time for the Feds to get their ducks in a line. I guess they're hoping Bolger slips on some wet tile or something.p.p.p.s. Over a year now since Bolgers arrest (06/11/2011) still dancing in court, Bolgers attorneys aver he had a deal with the Feds; sure would explain why he could hide in plain sight for 16 years."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This was a very interesting book, however I was disappointed that it came without the book jacket.

In the past few months, Pat has been approached by an alleged relative of alleged Bulger murder victim Brian Halloran. This relative seemed bent on establishing a rigorous schedule for Pat and had barely concealed hostility for Pat. Pat has suspicions that Pat might be a child of one of the informants, agents, or murder victims in this case and that it may have been leaked out deliberately or not. Pat has had all sorts of problems since Bulger left and was warned by a Cellucci/Bush supporter to leave Massachusetts when Bulger fled &quot; or lose everything&quot;.Governor Cellucci hosted his transition team meeting at the office of Sullivan and Cogliano, a recruitment firm with past ties to deceased Rocco Solimeno's business partner.Many bad things happened to Pat after Bulger fled. Pat became the target of personal attacks, rampant unemployment, financial destruction and eventual homelessness, all following the threat of the Cellucci/Bush supporter's predictions. Is Pat paying the price for something Pat doesn't even know about their past?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I know an individual who may be a critical pawn in this case. Around the time of the transition between the Bush and Clinton administrations, this individual was employed by a company with government contracts and informed in an intimidating manner &quot; we will be monitoring you..&quot; by alleged government personel. A couple years later, a local paper did a story on that person's quest to find out who their father is. Not long after the article, the editor disappeared, Whitey Bulger fled, Jonathan Harr's book about kids afflicted by water pollution came out and &quot; all hell broke loose&quot; for this individual. The person received numerous IRS audits and problems with their accounts at Fleet Bank( where at the time the IRS issued refund checks). In the Merrimack Valley,Mass. region, a major IRS facility, regional FBI office and other government agencies are located. This was also the area Jan Schlictmann of Harr's book frequented at a prominent lawyer's law offices. It has taken nearly 7 years, the statute of limitations for many crimes, for the FBI to assign a specialist fugitive hunter to the case.. Over the nearly 7 years, the individual had a wide series of &quot;job interviews&quot; that were anomalous in that the interviews appeared to be fact finding missions by interviewers who knew far more about this person's work history and personal activities than is demonstrated by interviewers,suggesting perhaps investigators (govt or private) who have been briefed about the individual ahead of time and are looking for anything incriminating, now matter how far-reaching, to build a case against the person. These 'interviewers' often &quot; moved on..&quot; not long after the interviews. Question: does Whitey or some other party in this case have a child that has been a pawn since day one to control him/them? This is a major question for the Burton committee. Has a case been increasingly built around such a child to penalize Bulger before and after the flight and if so what tactics and results might one expect to be used against the child? Might not such forces use everything from portraying the child as mentally ill to an unambitious bum? There is a serious concern also as to how this case can be properly investigated. If Burton's committee wanted an honest appraisal, then perhaps an agency with no links to either the Justice Dept and its subsidiaries or the FBI might be called on. This case is an entangled web of professional and personal breaches across several agency/law enforcement boundaries. And if a child/children have been used as collateral in the case, the question arises who and what entities may be involved. Could state authorities but not the FBI or Justice Dept or all of them have known about such children? Would the children by hated by all and treated accordingly?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"On page 53 of Susan Kelly's &quot;The Boston Stranglers&quot; (1995), Dr. Ames Robey,forensic psychiatrsit is quoted as saying that George Nassar, an extremely violent man and whom many suspected as the real Boston Strangler, was a suspect in 17-30 murders involving the gangland violence known as the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars, as depicted in Willie Fopiano's &quot;The Godson&quot;.

Did Flemmi or Bulger have children as a result of these activities? How strong were their ties to the pornography business? Were Bulger and Flemmi tied in any way to the Boston Strangler killings which remains controversial?Around the time Bulger disappeared, everything hit the fan for this person. Loved ones around them were threatened and as they went to the FBI and Justice Department and State Police they were ignored. Before Bulger disappeared this person was approached by alleged Defense Investigative Service and FBI personnel at a business seminar. This was also prior to the release of Jonathan Harr's book, &quot;A Civil Action&quot; and when it was released Bulger disappeared as this person became a target of harassment in sync with escalating media accounts of the case.The person was connected as a state child to a reputed gangster in the area with alleged ties to John Connolly as a foster child without their knowledge. The person was very young and the particulars were arranged by combined private and public human services representatives.When this case opened up these same connections to the former child started acting bizarre, as if anxious that the whole thing was unravelling. It has been speculated that perhaps this person is a child of Whitey's without their knowledge and that state and federal authorities all had a role in the upbringing of the child and perhaps the child was bounced around and neglected and/or physically and emotionally abused in proportion to Bulger's cooperation.None of the media has raised the prospect that a confluence of state and federal representatives effectively managed the Bulger case.This book does highlight how information was frequently passed between DEA and the FBI in informal channels and why should we believe it was limited to only these 2 agencies? The state police and DEA are detailed as investigating Bulger here while Connolly had ties to the DEA and FBI.All one has to do is look in any major yellow pages and you wil find all sorts of escort services complete with corporate account capability to know that society and the government does not find these things objectionable. Bulger and Flemmi may have simply been regional coordinators for these services. What we do not know is how many services or gratutities were actually provided to government and/or political officials and whether their continued generosity or lack of it is what contributed to their prosperity or demise. Bulger and Flemmi may have been involved in providing services for many agencies and the FBI might be bearing the brunt of the heat.In this book nor anywhere else has anyone tried to interview former military associates of Bulger and Flemmi or investigated possibly military involvement in their activities, especially where McIntyre was concerned.Will Congress make inquiries of the Defense Investigative Service which overseas industrial security and background checks with the secret service (see James Bamford's 'The Puzzle Palace') or the DIA?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Did the FBI or some agenc(ies) have a child Bulger might have had raised in close proximity to families with government agency ties and then assert government security to cover sanitization of records and the identity of the child?In 1963 the Defense Investigative Service is said to have been formed and in the 1980s NSA opened its recruiting office in Boston,Mass. where McIntyre was allegedly killed being affiliated with the precursor to NSA.

Then suddenly after a period of fighting one or two individuals appears in which the collective rage is focused. They are indicted in the media which fuels the frenzy, sent off to prison and things calm down. What we may be seeing here is the very nature of our society at work and how disagreements are worked out. When DeSalvo confessed, the need for justice was quenched but prior to this police didn't know if one or more individuals were involved. To this day controversy remains over whether DeSalvo was the strangler or not. Prior to Lee Harvey Oswald being arrested, a policeman was shot- to what purpose? This only fueled the hysteria and demands for instant justice.. capture Oswald, blame it all on him,satisfy public curiosity,move on. Case closed.All that is needed is for the rival groups to agree on how the public overspill of their squabble will be decisively and effectively silenced.In the Bulger case, you have a large number of murder victims and allegations as to who did them. They may be true, they may not. No one has considered whether these guys were set up to look like they had committed murders as surety for such a contingency as has developed here since 1995.As the case has exploded an ' every man for himself' mentality prevails and is it safe to say everyone will be on the up and up?The story focuses entirely on the negatives in the program, but not on how many people were helped or how many people were not sent to prison based on information provided by Flemmi and Bulger. It is publicly assumed they did nothing but evil, but we really don't know that. There is also the question of whether Flemmi and Bulger can provide a full defense if reports and other correspondence cannot be released due to classification constraints. Were murders solved or prevented by actions of Flemmi and Bulger? Kidnappings of children? Drug trafficking reduced to a manageable level?How many agents from any number of agencies may have been protected by the close quarter efforts of Bulger and Flemmi, even if they are unaware of it themselves?Still, this case does raise broad questions of how far we wish clandestine law enforcement efforts to go. What is the line of distinction between informants and secret police? How much priority is given to informant reports, as in the Limone/Salvati case? If more weight had been given in the Limone case, could some decisive action to intercept have occurred? What is our capacity to factor in unavoidable human error in the handling of these complex cases? How liable for their actions are informants where they provide services but are not fully trained as a bona fide agent is?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"With all the hype in this case, policymakers may do very little to curtail similar such abuses in the future. Just as this case is gaining exposure now, what abuses are going on now that we will hear about 20 or 30 years from now?Shredding and altering incriminating documentary evidence from my own knowledge of human services and other areas is nothing new by the government. I have seen state records involving kids in state care altered or shredded or tossed out because of potential liability. In these records are reports and labels and subjective commentary that can help or hurt the child's future. If the government will do this to children, what will it not do to adults? Perhaps the FBI handlers in this case can be viewed as similar to a social worker managing a case, filing reports on the client while the client is unable to review the information or to rebut any discrepancies while strangers down the road make judgements on the child's future using information of which the child is unaware.I may have some tie to one of the parties in this case on either side and never have been told this. Shortly before Bulger disappeared, i worked for a company with government contracts and was intimidated by an agency that met with me while there. After Bulger disappeared, i was approached by individuals coming in as temps at another company who seemed nice at first and befriended me. Over the ensuing months and a couple of years, it soon became apparent these individuals were not my friends and were there to keep an eye on me, trying to compile information against me while issuing subtle and not subtle hints that they were watching me on a regular basis.These same individuals hinted that they had seen inside my home,reviewed some of my financial records, and had considerable detailed knowledge of my comings,goings and activities which i had not provided them with, even going to lengths to find out my video rentals. I had no criminal background and lived an ordinary life but with missing pieces in family background.These same individuals seemed very concerned about who i would vote for in state and federal elections. The complete lack of concern that they were following me around and harassing me seemed to be of little concern to them nor to the FBI or Justice Dept who ignored my requests for help after months and months of quiet intimidation about how one of these individuals in particular had been watching me come and go and specifically wanted to come to where i live for no good reason.

If this is the case,the future of these guys may have been mapped out for them by Intelligence and Law Enforcement officials without their ever knowing at a federal level.As an example, i know of one man who grew up in state child care abandoned by his family, abused and neglected. This man tested high on academic achievement despite this history using conventional measures. As a child the boy was shuffled about in a seeming random fashion until junior high and high school.At the beginning of high school the boy was tested and deemed college ready immediately at any college in the US. A large number of state and state-funded private workers,some with government service backgrounds, handled the child and there was considerable sanitization of his records as time went on. At key points if the boy competed in contests where intelligence was in some way measured, unusual outcomes resulted in his &quot;underachievement&quot;, as if to keep the boy from generating attention or interference from individuals who might have an educational interest in the boy's future.In high school a man going by the same name as this boy appeared in the same town he lived in.This man had a military service record and used this boy's address sometimes to mislead. On several occasions the identity of the other man was confused with this boy,inviting local police scrutiny. Eventually the boy (now a man) 'ended up' at a defense contractor and was subject to intimidation and numerous personal intrusions. Nearly 20 years later the man joined a prominent local church and this man who had been using his address and name was still following him around! How many career prospects were destroyed for the boy now a man? Does he even know?If Bulger and Flemmi had this sort of thing going on, they were set up as young children and steered into a future they had zero control over.This may have involved agencies far beyond the FBI or the Justice Dept, but the FBI is left holding the bag for it. The nature of classified work is such that a handful of people know the truth and even if information is shared, it is selective and can be misleading in the way it is given. if our government is hypothetically capable of molding children 'La Femme Nikita' style, how much blame goes to the kid and to the government officials that permit this to happen?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"When this case broke in 1995, i worked for a company with many government contracts and heavy political ties and affiliations with government agencies.

I had no criminal background, led a boring life, and volunteered as much as i could.My medical records began disappearing and i became suddenly chronically unemployable. Recruiters and companies would call me for interviews then cancel or 100% of the time i would not get the job. Worried that in the wake of this case perhaps rogue elements were at work, my state reps and senators would not so much as return my phone calls. Every state,local and federal law enforcement branch ignored my pleas for help. I discovered no one cared. Friends thought i was losing it until they heard the threatening phone calls and saw me being followed around by men in suits.Then they too suspected something was wrong."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"We are not likely to hear this in this case. This case brings many questions to bear. The Justice Dept oversees the Bureau of Prisons and the FBI so has powers of prosecution and incarceration. The FBI investigates itself and the Justice Dept via the Office of Professional Responsibility. The CIA investigates itself, as does presumably the NSA. Informants,their friends and family members are used all over.Sometimes informants even go so far as to become lovers with targets or unsuspecting associates of them only to break their heart later, unconcerned about the trail of heartbreak and hurt left behind. All too often we find the truths we suspect but cannot be proven true later when a final confession is made by an agency or its agents of morally and ethically questionable tactics. One problem in this case is that it seems as if agents are attributed with morew authority than they probably have, thus protecting higher ups who really did have the authority. We do not know what happened with the profits from this operation nor the forces that went into making Flemmi, a former Army paratrooper, and Bulger , a former Air Force veteran informants. Bulger came from an environment where police beat suspects mercilessly, and rival gangs struggled for power. Much has been made of Bulger and Flemmi's 'gang' but the reality is that all of us need membership in a 'gang' to survive. And once the intelligence agencies get involved, the target becomes the subject of harassment, extensive privacy invasions, and psychological warfare and character assassination using any means to alienate the target from friends,family, employers,etc. all but those cleared for the activities of the operative. Only a handful know the true purpose of the operative and those fulfilling the profile requirements. Until all the facts are in we cannot know if Flemmi and Bulger truly acted on their own or where threatened,coerced or otherwise manipulated by the FBI, CIA,Secret Service,NSA or other agencies.

From the experience of someone i know, a lot is being ignored or concealed in this case. Whitey's flight occurred around the time 'A Civil Action' was released by Jonathan Harr, about water pollution and a cancer epidemic in a city in Middlesex County,Massachusetts. The earliest signs of the epidemic occurred in the 1960s around the time Steve Flemmi was recruited by H Paul Rico. The water pollution controversy involved at some point the communities of Burlington, Winchester,Stoneham,Reading in addition to Woburn. Many thousands of people were potentially exposed to contaminated water. Middlesex County was a hub for space and military contracts, and Boston was a hub for military contracts as well. The Mclean-Mclaughlin wars began in the 1960s and according to Willie Fopiano the dividing line was Somerville and Charlestown.In 1963 John F. Kennedy was involved with NASA with Middlesex County (Woburn)a primary site.As the space budget had JFK's approval, miltary bases were cutting back.2 groups emerged:1)NASA for Woburn, and 2)Save our Shipyard(Boston Navy Yard).The Boston Navy Yard employed 3,000 and at least 10% of those lived in Middlesex County.The number of new jobs in Massachusetts to be created by the NASA site was roughly equal to or less the number of jobs at Boston Navy Yard but of different skillsets. A small group of workmen(according to local newspaper) transferred from Boston Navy Yard to Portsmouth Navy Yard. Not long after the USS Thresher (first fast attack nuclear sub)sank off Portsmouth,NH killing 129 sailors.A military officer testified before Congress that 20% of the backpressure relief valves had been installed backwards. So in 1963 the Thresher sank,JFK was shot and not long after the NASA site in Massachusetts collapsed, leaving millions of dollars in potential revenues and thousands of jobs abandoned. Given the military and space efforts in the area and cold war concerns with Vietnam raging, high national security in Massachusetts is a given. The Mclean-Mclaughlin wars began around the time of the events of 1963. Within Middlesex County reside or resided many of the characters noted in this case:Ring,Morris,Rico,Connolly,Limone,Mawn. In the area of the Boston Navy Yard: Flemmi, Bulger. In the collapse of the NASA deal,the chair of the Save our Shipyard committee, Cark Roessler, headed up the local Woburn Redevelopment Authority. Instead of NASA, Woburn and surrounding communities had industrial parks developed and local property taxes became among the lowest in the state. The wells in Woburn were not officially shut down until May,1979 and the controversy from the late 1950s until 1979 perpetuated.If they had been shutdown earlier, could this have been seen as a threat to either the NASA site or the industrial parks? Could the events in Massachusetts be summed up in Fletcher Knebel's book, 'Seven Days in May'?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"In 1995 2 things happened: 1) Whitey Bulger vanished ,and 2) Jonatha Harr's \\" A Civil Action\\" came out. The earliest signs of epidemic emerged in the early to mid 1960s in Woburn, when NASA was looking to locate the future site of the Houston space center in Woburn on a 1,000 acre site at a a cost of $50-60 million and to create 2-3,000 new jobs. JFK was involved in this site decision and 2 committees were formed at this time:1) NASA for Woburn and 2) Save our Shipyard. Mayor Gilgun headed the NASA committee while Carl Roessler,President of Burlington's Trans-Sonic Corp., a flow measurement device manufacturer, headed the shipyard committee.Both Gilgun and Roessler lived in Woburn. This book details the controversy over who knew what and when and the eventual closure of the wells under Mayor Gill's administration in May,1979. As JFK began promoting the change of the U.S. economy more on space, Robert McNamara was making decisions on base closings.The Boston Navy yard and Portsmouth,NH navy yards were in the area of base closings.Prior to the sinking of the nuclear USS Thresher in 1963, a small group of workmen from the Boston navy yard transferred to Portsmouth. The Thresher sank,killing 100+ sailors and a military officer testified 20% of the back pressure relief valves were installed backwards causing hull collaps while other speculated welding flaws-- both workmanship issues.Boston Edison approved the 1,000 acre site for development in Woburn. JFK was shot, the deal fell through at about the time of a physical survey of the site, and the site was moved to Houston and became the Johnson space center while part of it remained in Cambridge known as Draper Labs.In 1965 Steve Flemmi arose and 8-10 years later recruited Whitey Bulger.The Mclean-Mclaughlin wars broke out.In 1995,John Connolly, former FBI agent and Boston Edison executive, came under fire when Bulger vanished. So too, did Rico,Ring,Morris,Salemme,Mercurio,Condon most of which have ties to the Woburn area.As controversy surrounding Nick Paleologos and this book soared the Bulger case exploded also. At the peak of high emotions, Barry Mawn, of Woburn, appeared as head of the Boston FBI.In the 1960s-70s at the Woburn court was former FBI agent Ron Weafer and Tom Driscoll lived in the area at this time.Jan Schlictmann eventually worked for Tom Kiley who now represents William Bulger, Whitey's brother.Is there a common link, perhaps a child from the water pollution that binds the 2 cases?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Black Mass is the best I've read, by telling the true and factual story of Whitey Bulger. The authors have their tumb on the pulse of this story and know what the true facts are.

This is a heavily researched book with great local color and stories without the over-written narrative that often plagues such books. The authors do a splendid job of building a story of Boston and its characters from nothing and then drawing out broader implications. What a shame these events happened to such a great city through both criminals AND public servants."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"With the advent of the capture of Whitey Bulger by the FBI in June of 2011, Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill's book, \\"Black Mass: The Irish Mob, The Boston FBI, and a Devil's Deal' will be read by many. This is a first hand account of how Whitey Bulger, and Steve Flemmi became part of the FBI as informants, and in turn the FBI became informants for Whitey and Steve.The story goes back to the early 70's in South Boston when Whitey was growing up and became head of the Winter Hill gang. He was always a kid in trouble, it seems and never graduated from high school. He wanted to become the 'Lord of the Rings' in his town and slowly he built a reputation via gambling, drugs, corruption, mayhem and murder. No one wanted to cross Whitey. At the same time his brother, Billy, beccame a lawyer and then a politician and the father of nine children. Billy the good child and Whitey the black cat of the family.This book pulls us into the life of a criminal in South Boston, the Irish neighborhoods, and the Irish Mafia, the Winter Hill gang. 'Southie' is explored, its lure and its people. We meet the people who inhabit Southie and those that were part of Whitey's gang. Slowly we are introduced to the FBI, the men who developed Whitey as an informant, and who were pulled so far into the lure of Whitey's world that they came to respect and admire this criminal. We get to know John Connolly, the biggest fraud of them all. He protected Whitey at all costs, and all costs meant loss of freedom. The kind of mind and commitment needed to remain in denial about the kind of work he was doing and what he did to the FBI, itself, is incomprehensible.We also meet the victims, none of these crimes were victimless. It is said that Whitey killed 19 people, all of them had friends and family. Many of the bodies were not found until someone gave up the secrets. We come to know some of the families and what they experienced. The lives of people in Southie were difficult and some turned to crime. The choices usually were to become a cop or a criminal.We meet the lawyers who defend the Mafiosi and the criminals and come to know them. Mostly brilliant people, who want to do the right thing. The right thing sometimes meant laying out scenarioes that would hurt others. The lawyers, the FBI, the State Police, the DEA, the criminals and the everyday \\"Joes and Janes', these are the people who explore Southie.The writing is precise and filled with accurate timelines. The writing also kept me quite absorbed. I understood the personalities of these players. One side was often pitted against the other. Substantial informnation was relayed and in such a manner that it was difficult to put this book down. This book is as relevant today as it was in the 1990's. I can only hope that Lehr and O'Neill will write a new book that follows the path of Whitey from 19995 when he went on the 'lam', until the day he was captured.Highly Recommended. prsrob 07-03-11Rogues and Redeemers: When Politics Was King in Irish BostonTrue Crime Authors Black Mass with Dick Lehr and Gerard O'neill.

I'd read other true crime books, and I knew of many criminals who \\"turned state's evidence\\" to avoid jail time. But this was the first time I ever heard of the top crime boss being an informer himself. It was also the first time I read about an FBI agent who let information flow the other way!James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger would have been just another Irish American hoodlum from South Boston. But some time in the late 1960's, he came across a man he'd known from childhood, now an FBI agent. he agent's name was John Connolly, and he was enamored with the \\"gangster\\" legends of Boston and Chicago. He allowed Bulger to sign on as an informant, which would provide anti-Mafia evidence for Connolly and protection for Bulger. Informer status does not mean the informant can commit murder, but Connolly let that side. Over the years, Connolly began to supply Bulger with confidential information, allowing him to intimidate local businesses, kill off witneses, and eventually flee the coutnry to avoid prosecution. Bulger hasn't been seen since.Black Mass is well-written and unbiased, without any style or taking sides. That may produce a long read, but the author doesn't induce the reader to make judgements. The end result is you feel that Boston's history is one of ruin and despair."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"If you live in Boston, as I did for a few years, the name Whitey Bulger is as resonate as Jimmy Hoffa. Both were men feared by some and idolized by others. Both had no qualms about victimizing those who feared and idolized them. Both were seen by some as the guy like them who managed to stand up to the Establishment. And both disappeared. But nobody thinks Whitey is buried at Gillette Stadium.Whitey Bulger was a mythic figure in Boston, especially his old neighborhood of Southie, the gangster who always managed to slip out of the hands of the law.But even Southie little boys and girls grew up dreaming of becoming FBI agents. Chances are their dreams didn't involve having gangster over to the house for dinner. John Connolly, another son of Southie, dared to have this dream and in pursuit of it he pretty much turned the Boston office of the FBI into Whitey Bulger and his Winter Hill gang's own little intelligence squad.Make no mistake about it, James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger and his partner Stevie \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmie were crooks, thugs, murderers, and all around low lifes. One could spend hours cataloging their many crimes. Oddly, they fail to get the credit they deserve for their pioneering work in the field of bromance. Any law enforcement agent can have an informant. Any crook can become a snitch. But it takes real imagination to turn it into quite evenings at home with your snitch/handler at the home of the handler's boss enjoying a home cooked meal the handler's boss has prepared. Candles, wine - champagne on occasion, steaks and the occasional visit from Whitey's powerful politician brother to share the latest family pictures. Just another night at Chez Agent Morris. Special dinners away from the cares of work aren't enough to keep a bromance alive, either. You need to show your bro that you care. Really care. Don't be afraid to give him a give now and then. A bottle of wine, a tasteful silver champagne bucket or a very special belt buckle says \\"I think you're the best\\" more than words ever can.This is one mind-bending story and Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill are perfectly suited to the task. Their journalistic style is spot on in terms of original research and the kind of prose that doesn't get in the way of illuminating facts. Lehr & O'Neill know when to let these looney-tunes speak for themselves as in this line from murderer Stevie Flemmie that actually made me laugh out loud:\\"I received a sweatshirt from (Agent) Nick Gianturco.\\"The next time you're wondering what to get that special multiple murderer in your life, look no farther than your local sporting goods store. I kept hoping it was some sort of demented joke about giving a fleece to a thief but no, ethically challenged FBI Agents John Morris and John Connolly and their pals thought this made sense.This is an entertaining, well-researched, well-written book. The only flaws are that it drags in the final chapters when they provide perhaps a bit too much detail about the grand jury proceedings that ultimately brought this sordid business to light and that the books begs to be updated to cover Connolly's recent convictions. Aside from that, this is as smart a book about the mob as any True Crime fan could hope for. Highly recommended for any True Crime fan, anyone interested in the Mafia and anyone from Boston.Kindle note: Photographs included."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book provides an excellent summation of the relationship that developed between ambitious FBI agents and the ever manipulative Bulger. It shows how the FBI in it's obsession with taking down the LCN, at first rationalized Bulgers criminal behavior and later became a accomplise to it by informing Bulger of investigations by other agencies and telling him who was informing on him. At times early in the book the authors jump ahead in their chronological telling of this tale, to show the outlandish behavior of the FBI agents and their inappropriate closeness with him and Flemmi, this caused some confusion as to what events happened when especially when the authors returned to the specific time period they were discussing. However this doesn't take away from the over all picture they were painting and in the end they make an excellent case."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Unfortunately the legend of Whitey will be the Bonnie and Clyde story for generations to come. Sure what he did was reprehensable and sinister. Bulger was a crime boss that employed tactics taught in some of our finer business schools. He gained trust and incorporated deceit to attain his capital goals. His alignment with Flemmi was a business move, he got closer to the enemy. His shrewdness cannot be overlooked, his manipulation of Morris and Connoly's FBI status worked in his favor. Competing corporations surly would find such business acumen enlightening. The book reveals how just important &quot;politics&quot; is to make it in life. So true as the saying goes &quot;its not what you know, it's who you know.&quot; The book is a great read. Growing up in Boston I often wondered how come they were untouchable. Read it and you will have an understanding how they were able tos tay in control. Connolly is culpable in all of this and knew it's consequences. However he should not be the scapegoat of the FBI's informants policy. With ego's involved this was bound to backfire and the mere mention of William Bulger sent everyone into a tizzy, James Bulger saw a business opportunity. Connolly loved the action of the whole charade and justified his behavior by srewing the LCN. The mandate from Washington was the LCN was evil at it's best and therefore should be brought down at all cost. Even the U.S. Attorney looked the other way. Connolly did his job and organized crime got theirs. Innocent people payed the price and that is unfortunate. The life of crime depicted here portrays a profession that is dog eat dog and only the shrewd can survive."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is a gripping story of just how corrupt a law enforcement agency can become - in this case, the Boston office of the FBI.

All this in name of protecting &quot;valuable informants.&quot; I've not read a better tale of criminal activity, political influence, and white collar corruption set in one of the most interesting of all American cities, Boston.

One thing to note is that attempts may be being made even now to make it look like that person for example is not really looking for work as opposed to being blackballed. This can be done easy by calling on a recorded line and carefully wording the conversation such that it appears the target is saying what you want them to say when in fact it is wrong. Or by making such terrible offers that person is unlikely to take a position then using spin to make it sound like they simply didn't give the job consideration. It sounds like someone might want that person out of work and financially broken and is covering themselves in the process."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"The Justice Dept has just unveiled new criteria for dealing with informants. But some serious questions remain.If one views informants as a partnership between an agency,its agents and the informant, long term close work can forge a camaraderie as informant and official teamup to fight crime. If the informant is not committing crimes, then what is wrong with socializing with agents or even exchanging gifts? Are the informants not de facto independent contractors of the agency? The way informants seem portrayed in the media is in an inferior position with respect to the agent but isn't it more of a partnering? Where the potential danger comes in is if either agent or informant commits crimes with the aid of the other. Because Bulger and Flemmi are not available for comment, we don't have the full picture.The bond that can be formed between agent and informant is increased because of the inherent dangers to each involved in pursuing crimes. The informant needs the protection offered by the agent and agents in the field surely need protection offered by informants.In this case we don't know if gifts were exchanged between agents and informants as bribes or as gestures of friendship and kinship developed over the years in a shared mission.It might be an issue of gratitude on both sides and not payback at all.What you've got in this case is a whole lot of angry,hurt people looking to pin responsibility. You have testimonials from parties who have cut deals with the Justice Dept who have in turn now earned the label 'informant', becoming that which they say they felt so betrayed by.These newly made informants might now have a glimpse of what could have caused Flemmi and Bulger to turn informant.So easy to judge?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"What so few commentators point out is that government has a collective psychology which can be exploited, as Hitler found out as well as J Edgar Hoover, and Slobodan Milosevich, a trained psychiatrist. If you consider govt as a collective capable of ultimate self-protection, then anything can become possible if it is threatened by real or perceived antigens. When you consider the degree of secrecy and confidentiality required by the alleged players in this case, one cannot rule out that forces might be out to destroy them using clever and insidious means. One such way is an active discrediting campaign aimed at making the defendants appear as psychologically unstable characters whose testimony in court can be attacked for its credibility based on carefully contrived proofs of instability. If these individuals were in such high risk activities it might be reasonable to suggest that they were heavily monitored because of potential fallout by other individuals who could be used to manipulate the lives of these guys and basically playmind games. If you have a group of people aimed at creating stress in your life, how long could you last before someone could construct a case that made you appear crazy? Especially if your communications are being monitored such that your innermost thoughts, problems and plans could be known? The nature of undercover work and such is to be able to maintain a persona not yours over sometimes a very prolonged period.Deception is perfectly acceptable and manipulating people and events becomes standard. These sorts of strategies are often developed in collusion with psychological and psychiatric professionals to permit an individual to do this sort of thing naturally. What we are taught in school,church,temple as wrong becomes perfectly acceptable. In the movie &quot;The Skulls' is a scene where an inductee becomes a threat and is thrown into a mental hospital and drugged up to protect the powerful elite who control the organization. Perhaps this is not so far-fetched.The threat the inductee posed was knowledge of the truth. This is a society which punishes honest mistakes,rewards cover-ups and discourages contrition. Someone or a group of people know what really happened here and are not talking. Is it fear? Guilt? Shame? Indifference?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"About the time Whitey disappeared, someone i know worked with a small group of individuals at a Fortune 500 company and began getting harassed severely. These individuals alternately claimed affiliation with Whitey and/or Connolly and wanted to know if this person was 'going to make money off of &quot; A Civil Action&quot; '. These same individuals alleged varying alliances to the Mass. state police, DEA, CIA. As this case heated up in local media, so too did the harassment.No one as far as we know has investigated former miltary service associates of Bulger and Flemmi to see if they have knowledge useful to the case. In Bulger's case that would be the Air Force and Flemmi's the army.Considering the sensitivity of the connections and activities in this case, one might wonder if Flemmi and Bulger were granted security clearances and if so might their personal and professional activities have been scrupulously monitored? No one has given serious consideration to the use of coercion in this case. The coercion need not have only come from the FBI but other state or federal agencies. If Whitey for example had children, wouldn't they be excellent insurance for future control of Whitey or could Whitey,Flemmi,Connolly or Rico have had some control over a government official's children?The timing of the Hanssen spy case comes at a propitious moment for the FBI, as this lends further credence to deniability of knowledge of Flemmi,Connolly, Bulger's activities."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I picked up this book used and found it to be really excellent. I think Whitey is still on the most wanted list. Given some of things the government has done in the past it won't suprise me if he was never caught and this gets into why often mentioning that he was very overrated as an informant on the Boston LCN. Probaly used the FBI to become the most powerful mob boss in Boston despite being Irish. He did a lot of hits for the Boston LCN as perhaps as many as any top enforcer in Boston and was overvalued as an informer.

Were rumors and other character assassination techniques used to make Flemmi and Bulger ineligible for legitimate employment? It has also been said that when the govt wants to make you work for them., they will spread disinformation such that no employer would want to touch you.. maybe Flemmi and Bulger encountered this.

If Whitey had a child, was this child targeted as the child attended the alma mater of agent John Morris? Has the child been systematically harassed and had their reputation destroyed in Massachusetts by either the government or perhaps rival mobsters or both? If there was a child, was the child prevented from finding work by screening their calls? If there was a child could it have become imperative to make the child look like a failure or less than spectacular performance in school?

Look at what Hoover was able to do while the Justice Dept was powerless against him. The FBI and similar agencies are so dangerous because their mission is to gather dirt on people. By doing this and keeping the files 'confidential', one might ask why someone would gather huge amounts of information on people and keep them from seeing what has been compiled unless it is for future retaliatory purposes or for intimidation?These questions are unknowns but serious because how many people have been convicted on the word of an FBI agent? Because of this power agents need to be of the highest caliber and integrity. It must not be an easy job to be such an agent.Perhaps the empowerment of individual agents is grossly exaggerated in this case. It seems that FBI management is much more in control than the agent in the field.If FBI management has targeted someone and an investigating agent in the field finds extenuating circumstances or information that reflects positively on the target, does FBI management stifle those reports to get the target anyway? Does FBI management manage investigations just like a business does, in terms of profits and loss? This book focuses on the FBI but these same questions can apply across the board to other law enforcement and allied bodies as well."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"During the Hoover administration, FBI agents had their relationships, like a potential fiancee, screened by an FBI approved background check. I wonder if this is still done, and if so, the FBI knows way more about the various relationships in this case than it admits. Many negative things have been said about Connolly ,Flemmi,Bulger, but as an orphan in state care in Boston with a private state-funded program, my short time in Boston was among the best years of my life in a childhood of physical and emotional abuse and abandonment. I don't know if these individuals had a role in the generosity we as disposable kids experienced by the business and nonprofit community in Boston and Brookline, having opportunities to see movies,swim in a public pool, and go to museums.These were not a cure, but they brought civility into our lives. Billy Bulger was a big advocate of child abuse prevention and i don't know if i was a beneficiary of that but my short experience in Boston, outside of witnessing some of the horrors of forced busing in Bromley,Heath and Mission Hill was positive. Much negative stuff in this book tries to portray the Irish as ruthless killers and organized crime as immoral but sympathetic victims. Throughout my tenure as a disposable kid, by and large the Irish community most warmly greeted me. I also met some kind Italian people, but far more Irish people who accepted me into their lives.I did not know my own ethnic background, looked Italian but was never really greeted in that community. As a young child i cried often wishing someday i would land with a family that would love me and i could have a normal life until one day there were no more tears to shed and no family that could make me feel at home. I cannot sterotype the Italian or Irish communities, but i am somewhat distressed by the protrayal of the Irish community as a band of ruthless gangsters as this book suggests. There are noble and not so noble elements in every single ethnic group and the reader needs to understand this and not jump to conclusions about the Italian or Irish communities."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"The best book about what really happened!!!! I couldn't put it down; a real page turner. Highly recommened reading for anyone who wants to know the truth."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"&quot;Black Mass&quot; is the story of a big time Irish gangster, James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, and how he turned informant for the FBI. Unlike other instances where this has occurred, however, Bulger managed to corrupt his FBI handlers as they aided and abetted his twenty year crime spree. Authors Lehr and O'Neill know this story well, having covered it for many years with the local Boston newspapers. It is a good lesson in what can happen to anyone, especially a law enforcement officer, when little indescretions lead to major breaches in ethics. What the book does not have enough of, unfortunately, are first hand descriptions of the mobsters plying their trade. There is some of it in the book, but most of the stories are second hand. Unlike other notable recent mob stories, like &quot;Wise Guy&quot; and &quot;Underboss,&quot; the focus is not on mob life itself. Overall, I found the book to be about a hundred pages or so too long, though still an interesting read for anyone who like real life crime stories."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I read this book with great expectations, but it didn't fully deliver. Despite the fascinating subject matter, and some gripping passages, it reads like a &quot;rush job&quot; and collage of old newspaper stories.

Is this the case here? If so we may not want to rush to judgement.A civil case involving a number of agents and the informants is in the works with Judge Wolf allegedly presiding.Agent Rico is unable to be charged due to insufficient evidence. Connolly, trained by Rico, continues to be a major target. Frank Salemme, for years targeted to be an informant and allegedly harassed as such, is said to be cooperating now. Caught in the middle are the families and friends of the agents and informants involved.There seem to be few avenues of getting potentially relevant information to the FBI. Likewise, we don't know how objectively any leads are treated."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"It may be possible that leaks in many govt agencies are commonplace and not linked to a given political administration but more linked to the structure of this country as a mosaic of conflicting groups all striving for ascendancy and with the scales in one direction then another as the power keeps shifting.I have seen leaks in many agencies of which i have some experience, including agencies listed in this book and more.If you look at these competing groups as carving territories for themselves, then an individual outside of the group most dominant in the agency might be pushed away, as perhaps the victims were who approached the FBI as alleged.Also, when you have an agency and employees in it dealing with classified information, that information is usually heavily controlled and individuals only given bits &amp; pieces with precious few having the big picture. Where they may be many security ramifications involving Bulger and Flemmi and their activities, it may be safe to say that the full truth cannot be disclosed because of security considerations which may be held over their heads."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"When reading a book like this it is easy to judge. Ordinary people become suspicious of government institutions because carefully concealed practices sometimes slip through that erode the public trust,leaving us frightened of our own government. But one must also consider organized crime in general and not just the Mafia- how many people have been hurt as opposed to helped by the Mafia? Is the Mafia known for benevolence or cruelty? The role of organized crime seems to be in the dealings of activities which are not legal but may pose greater issues of morality that cannot be universally agreed upon.And it seems that a clear line is drawn between legal and illegal that also creates 2 clear sides of authority-- if it is legal, the govt gets a cut;if not, organized crime prevails. But it seems that the govt and organized crime can be competing for control of the same things.But when it comes to obtaining justice, the govt has clear superiority.The govt can bring to bear unlimited time and resources to bring someone down,oftentimes empowered with techniques that non-govt parties could go to jail for,like surreptitious eavesdropping and entry into homes and vehicles and the like.The govt has been known to tap phones and conduct electronic surveillance of individuals for YEARS! Should there be a limit to how long this sort of activity can go on? Another interesting element is the career paths of govt employees; how often does it occur that justice is not done because of future promises of employment in the private sector? This holds not just for law enforcement but from all branches of govt from public to private sectors. One of the most disturbing of allegations in this case is that for nearly 3 decades the players in this book operated but the oversight mechanisms of the FBI or Justice Dept did not kick in. Is it possible that other agencies with higher authority than the agents in this case had were involved in some way? And must informants have clearances allied with the levels their handlers have,thus falling into monitoring for compliance thereof? And anyone who has ever seen an employment application for FBI service knows that admission into the FBI is not easy or quick process.These individuals are extensively investigated and scrutinized and voluminous files created detailing their backgrounds and assorted connections. This case calls into question the character of the agents, but they obviously had what it takes to get into the FBI as well as to eventually retire with successful careers. Bulger and Flemmi are portrayed as serial killers, but don't lose sight of the fact that the FBI has extensive resources in profiling at their disposal and virtually unlimited technical expertise to draw from that should have prompted any flags relating to the mental stability of Flemmi and Bulger."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"When this book came out, many people became casualties of this clash of forces that are not mentioned in this book. I began having all sorts of sudden problems, like interference with federal aid for college, problems with my schooling at a major Boston college, being blackballed by employers and being ignored or belittled by leading politicians in Massachusetts. This is a complex tapestry of clashing forces that i wonder if it is connected to the major clashes in economic concerns in Massachusetts in the 1960s between forces loyal to the space program and those loyal to the military during JFK's presidency. The heat and harassment has been continuous on me since this case really exploded in 1995. I have also had many suspicious job interviews with individuals who seem more interested in gleaning personal information out of me or discrediting me than giving me an opportunity. At times it seems like it could be mafia -related and at others like parties trying to make it look like someone else is trying to 'get' me.

It is also a classic example of consequences by trusting the crooks, and how easily investigation agencies fall in trap to get any information about the organized crime.John Connolly, an FBI agent, trusts the mobster James Bugler (a.k.a Whitey Bulger), who after spending time in Alcatraz became an FBI informant along with Stephen Flemmi. Both of them brilliantly used that position to eliminate competition from other mob groups and thus managed to get their own control on organized crime in Boston.In this book Connolly is often portrayed as the victim, who fall into the trap in order to rise within the FBI. However, in reality, FBI thinks that Connolly alerted Bulger and Flemmi of investigations carried out by FBI and Boston Police Dept., and gave false reports to FBI, which helped the Bulger and Flemmi cover their crimes. In 1998, the FBI also accused Connolly with charges of bribery. Connolly and Flemmi are still serving time in prison, whereas the Bulger is still maintaining his position in the FBI Top 10 Fugitive list. The sympathy with Connolly can be understood, but presenting him as a victim is not justified either.Having said that, Dick Lehr, and Gerard O'Neill have done an excellent job in providing the accurate details of the events. Their experience as journalists helps a lot in keeping the readers glued to the book. The way events unfold, and facts revealed, are interesting enough to keep your pages turning. This is quite a book, recommended to anyone who is interested in crime history, and mafia in United States."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is an intriguing tale of corruption and total failure by law enforcement to monitor its informant activities.

For years Connally and Morris served as Whitey's enablers, overlooking or silently sanctioning years of crime, corruption, and violence.While the book gives Bulger credit for shrewdness and duplicity in outwitting the FBI, it also leaves one in no doubt as to the rancid character of Whitey, no Robin Hood of South Boston here, but a traitorous drug-dealer to the youths of Southie, a vicious hood and a thoroughly violent and repellant criminal.

And, using his informant status as a shield, he grows his criminal empire and commits just about every crime on the books, including murder. As incredible as it sounds, it's all true and it's all here, and it's better than fiction. This is a powerfully written narrative by two prize-winning investigative reporters who covered the story and revealed some of its most dramatic elements. By combining their powerful reporting skills with rich writing flair, Lehr and O'Neill bring readers into the heart of darkness. They show how a relationship that began among children in the housing projects of South Boston evolved into a corrupt deal among dangerous adults that ultimately humiliated the nation's top law-enforcement agency and extended the reign of some of the very mobsters the FBI was supposed to eradicate. The book moves seamlessly from the streets and storerooms of Boston, to the corridors of political power, to the ornate federal courthouse where the deal comes crashing down."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"\\"Black Mass\\" is the chilling account of how two killers from South Boston were able to manipulate the FBI for a period of decades. James\\"Whitey\\" Bulger and Stephen \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi were legendary wiseguys in Boston during the 1970s. John Connolly a childhood acquaintance of Bulger's who made good and joined the Boston FBI. When Connolly hooked up with the tough guy from his old neighborhood things began to go awry.Connolly was awed by his friendship with Bulger and used his contact in the underworld as proof of his prowess as an agent. For their part Bulger and Flemmi were able to pass along innocuous mob gossip to the Feds in exchange for protection form local law enforcement. Carefully placed tidbits of information helped the FBI to arrest enemies of the Bulger gang. With each arrest Whitey and Flemmi were able to expand their own power base. Those people who complained to the police were inevitably redirected to the FBI. Once the bureau had its hands on a case, the stonewalling began. This was a cycle that continued from the late 60s up until the mid 90s. During this period the \`invaluable informants' provided little of substance to their \`handlers'. However the agents were able to cook the reports and win commendations and promotions for themselves. At the same time, over a dozen murders are directly attributed to the pair.If there is honor among thieves you can't prove it from this book. \\"Black Mass\\" is a shocking story of deceit and corruption within Boston law enforcement, politics and organized crime. It is almost impossible to describe the level of hubris on the part of the crooks who were protected by the FBI and those very agents who cosseted the killers in order to advance their own careers. If they are lucky, the crooks end up behind bars, but many meet their fate in the trunk of a car.No small part of this seems to flow from good old-fashioned insularity, the \\"Us vs. Them\\" mentality so prevalent in South Boston. The area was still reeling throughout the 1970s from the forced bussing earlier in the decade. To many Bulger, was a mythic Robin Hood figure. He might be a crook but he was Southie's crook and a damned good one at that. With a cunning that allowed him to outwit the police at every turn, it was a blow for hometown pride that the Italian Mafia was failing while the Irish mob was waxing in power. This was the myth that the Bulger gang worked to promote while at the same time Whitey was murdering and extorting from the citizens of his old neighborhood. His cunning ability to outwit the police boiled down to being an informant for the FBI and his concern for the streets he grew up on is evident by how he promoted the use of drugs to the people in Southie.This account is a sad story of how the best intentions (Like the FBI informant program) can have the worst results."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"The plot of \\"Black Mass\\" revolves around a fateful decision by the Boston FBI concerning the so-called Irish Mafia of South Boston and its infamous boss-the notorious James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger. The FBI was so eager to break up the local Italian Mafia that, for years it used Whitey as a confidential informant. Was there a payback? There certainly was: Whitey was allowed to run his bookmaking, loan sharking, shake downs and other criminal activities without serious interference from law enforcement. Were there \\"complications\\"? There certainly were: Apart from obvious slippery morality behind the FBI operation, certain local agents get \\"slightly too cozy\\" with Whitey and his right hand man, Stevie \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi. There is a great nickname! I won't divulge what happens but suffice it to say that a sharp eyed-or was it sharp eared? -Defense attorney unravels the deal. Is justice ultimately done? The reader will just have to find out by him or herself! Fair warning: the epilogue fails to tie up all loose ends. BM reads as if it were two stories. The early going is uneven, choppy and routine. Then BM finds its' stride and develops into fine true crime reading. Perhaps that was due to dual authorship or dual editing. The end result is ultimately satisfying. BM is an excellent example of the dangers of good intentions (stopping the Italian Mafia) unraveling into a its' own sinister crisis and creating its' own maelstrom of crime. BM is a 5 star work, but with one star subtracted for the weaker early stages. Boston residents can quite easily add back the 5th star.

The tale of, as the subtitle suggests \\"an unholy alliance\\" between mobsters and FBI agents. A story replete with larger than life killers such as Whitey Bulger, heinous crimes, cover ups, betrayals, and victims both innocent and deserving. The writing duo of Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill benefit from having unknowingly started work on the book years years in advance as reporters. They ultimately had access to volumes of interviews, background material to go along with their many first hand encounters the leading players of the story. Their intimate knowledge of the people, places and events made them naturals to tell the wider story and they came through with flying colors. The writing combines the best features of investigative reporting and dramatic non fiction.At the heart of the story are FBI agents John Connolly and Dick Morris who started off using notorious gangsters Bulger (whose very different brother has served as a Massachusetts state senator and university president) and Steve \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi as informants to help bring down the Boston area Mafia. In large part they succeeded but at what a price! The agents crossed the line -- more liked leaped over it -- and befriended the pair, literally letting the two get away with murder (along with other felonies) in the process. Bulger and Flemmi would dine and exchange gifts with the agents one day and go about extorting, drug tracking, loan sharking and killing the next.\\"Black Mass\\" is at times heart breaking, infuriating and fascinating. In it we see much of the underbelly of human behavior and the degree to which people in the public trust can be co-opted. Herein is my only quibble with the authors, as I would have liked more of an analysis of what made the agents, Connolly in particular, \\"go bad.\\"The authors are nonetheless to be lauded for a commendable job. \\"Black Mass\\" is a great read."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"If you research the history of Massachusetts you will find that the early to mid 1960s was a frenzy of projects and activity during the height of Kennedy power and influence. In Middlesex County Congressman F. Bradford Morse represented a district that even included Lawrence,Mass. In Middlesex County the space and military sectors flourished with projects as Apollo in Bedford, Voyager in Wilmington,a NIKE missile base in Burlington, the Boston Navy Yard, and such music greats as Bob Dylan,Joan Baez, and Muddy Waters playing at Club 47 in Cambridge. JFK, before he was assassinated, endorsed Woburn as the future site of the Johnson Space Center.One of the most constructive things which can come out of this case is to understand precisely the politics and sociological events in the wake of JFK's assassination and economic intrigues in the region as a precipitator of the violence that is tragically the focus of this book and case. In the 1960s a minimum of 24 organized crime families prospered nationwide. Hollywood portrays such groups as unsophisticated, but when one considers the nature of the beast, each organized crime family might be viewed as a clan of varying size and influence through all strata of government which forms the 'informal government'. To those not involved such groups a lot of things must seem like random events but not so to those involved.By understanding the dynamics involved we gain a better understanding of how events are orchestrated by the subtle interplay of cooperating and sometimes competing groups."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This work is quite interesting but one thing i am concerned about is that there has not been hard proof that Whitey Bulger and Steve Flemmi actually performed any murders or organized them. Much of the case against Bulger and Flemmi seem to stem from testimony by persons trying to get out of serious culpability for what transpired.Kevin Weeks for example, who was groomed by Bulger and now is looking at serious prison time is cooperating with federal authorities in laying all the blame at Bulger and Flemmi's feet.We don't know right now who is actually responsible for what and it may be premature to pass judgement on Connolly,Bulger and Flemmi until all the facts,if ever,are in."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"In following this case i don't know what to think.The recent admission of a number of women now full-grown admitting to being targeted by Flemmi and Bulger for sex and porno films and the way it is described is quite believable. I know someone quite well who has had seen this sort of thing happen and with individuals associated with other branches of the government as well. Teen boys are often targeted by homosexual and bisexual predators and this person knew of some businessmen that targeted in particular kids in foster care or kids from dysfunctional families. These individuals got away with it because they had close ties, often family members, linked to high level government positions that could come to their aid if any local law enforcement action was taken. In the case of this person mentioned, teen boys were targeted and bribed with money or gifts or favors for sex or if that didn't work, their 'connections' were mentioned as a potential threat.One man in particular hinted at violence as well.What might be coming out in this case is that there is a whole economy based on a confluence of drugs,prostitution,pornography, blackmail and extortion of which the government itself has a strong financial interest in perpetuating. Vulnerable teenagers from broken homes or without homes may be a prime choice of recruiting for these economic sectors and people like Flemmi and Bulger are relatively small with respect to this whole underground economy which is global in nature. The women who have come forth do sound quite believable in describing what went on but the question in all of this remains: did Flemmi and Bulger voluntarily choose this or were they pushed into it,only later to adapt or accept that lifestyle? In other words, will locking up Flemmi and Bulger and 'throwing the key away' do anything to change future exploitation of unwilling girls and boys? Would we feel differently if individuals choose this lifestyle after they have become adults?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is a captivating account of government methods,psychology and ethics. But ask yourself this:Say Whitey or Flemmi or any other informants has children, does the government lay claim to those children to replace their parents in these roles? Will the government destroy such people if they do not want this kind of life? Take an example of one man who is said to have a father unknown to him but is alleged to have been a friend of Whitey unknown to the boy...Before Bulger fled the man worked for a company with defense contracts and was told he was being cleared for a basic security clearance. The process took over a year and a half and required the man to sign an affidavit with the alleged defense official claiming never to file for bankruptcy again after being advised it was the only way to get the clearance and keep the job at the time after a lengthy unemployment. About a year after this process, the man was featured in a local Massachusetts newspaper looking for answers to his long last father. The paper changed ownership shortly after and the editor and reporter were unknown to the new editor and reporters. Shortly after Whitey fled the man was suddenly fired but not before being told by an alleged government official that he was to be monitored for an indeterminate amount of time and with no definitive scope to the monitoring or reason why. After being fired, the man had an IRS levy with no notice, annual IRS audits,missing money from his bank account in which the IRS had an account with the same national bank and threatening calls. Progressively the man was financially strangled and it became apparent the goal was to ruin him financially and monitor his communications and parties to which he was communicating.The end result was to bankrupt the man, make him unemployable, and to ultimately make him homeless and without a means to maintain a phone. The man was sequestered with a group of 10 people(which number matches a group of 10 alleged witnesses sequestered and announced as witnesses against Bulger in 1999 but which has never come to pass)who tormented the man for being responsible for the Bulger fiasco whil staging photos,etc. to make it look like the man was happily working with such a group.New &quot;friends&quot; entered the man's life and as the man grew to like and trust them,they announced a friend or family member in the FBI just before the man was screwed in one form or another.This was a man with no criminal past.Why has the government reform committee and now the Massachusetts state police given up on investigating this whole thing and why would the U.S. government target and destroy a person for a past unknown to them? Does Flemmi,Bulger or some other principal in the Bulger case have a child that is being used as a whipping boy to force cooperation or to keep perhaps Bulger in hiding?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"That's what this case is like. This case is in many ways similar to the case of Danny Casolaro and his pursuit of 'The Octopus'.Someone i am familiar with suddenly became chronically unemployable in the Middlesex County area, blanketing Massachusetts and New Hampshire with resumes to employers and getting no job. At a 1/40,000 probability of getting a job in 40,000 submittals,the probability is .000025 and this person does not even have that high odds."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I know an individual who has repeatedly submitted background information that might be highly relevant to this case to America's Most Wanted only to have themselves targeted afterwards. This individual knows of a boy who was bounced around and with roots in the region of Salemme and Salvati. This boy bounced around different foster homes,was abused and even beaten as a youth by school authorities and may be the son of Flemmi,Bulger or someone else in this case. The boy's mother died young under somewhat questionable circumstances and when her obituary was published her age was listed as nearly 2 decades younger than she actually was, a fact overlooked by anyone who inquires about it.Notlong before Bulger vanished the boy, now a man, had a story done about his search for his father. Bulger disappeared, the man lost his job,school authorities who had been harsh now attempted to do good by him, and social workers where contact was still maintained began acting anxious,standoff-ish and perhaps even defensive.Some people he once knew began reappearing in his life with names different than ones he met them under.When this case became prevalent in the media, increased media attention in the case resulted in proportional harassment of this man in the form of threats,phone calls,and much more.The boy had been mistreated because of his family background, but the boy did not know his background because he was already in foster care before age 1.It appears that the boy was shuffled around and mistreated perhaps because of information provided about him to his caretakers that may have been misleading.If the boy is the son of someone in this case, it may have been leaked out and the boy became a target. Could the man be Whitey Bulger's son and have suffered much abuse because of the reputation of Bulger? If he is the son of Bulger, was the boy raised in close proximity to the families of government employees? Could a child have been forced to suffer if his father did not cooperate with either the government or organized crime?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This is a surface tale of alleged mafia rivalries and the confluence of organized crime and government.One of the dangers in this case is to paint either the FBI or Mafia as victims. Neither group has a reputation as such..each is viewed more as predator than prey. This case also makes it easy to single out the FBI but what about the IRS, ATF,Treasury Dept, Corrections Dept and so on? In all these agencies you have good people and not so good people. If even half the allegations against the major players in this case are true, not only is lack of internal discipline and external oversight evident, but also the the extent,pervasiveness and real danger of organized crime.Organized crime in general is far greater than just the Mafia and cuts across all ethnic groups. Organized crime figures are often seen as flashy, intriguing, and the underdog, but how often do you hear of an organized crime member serving the community, say as a legitimate volunteer for a charity? The majority of images conjured by organized crime are of terror,intimidation, violence, and intrusion into all key areas of government. Sometimes organized crime does good but its basic purpose is not to help people but to further its own power and money base. This case is about a major event(s) that precipitated violence and other ends between rival but peer groups.The FBI's mandate appears to be to help and protect but many of its decisions may be simple business decisions. As long as the FBI withholds information on the rationale behind its actions the ends and means in this case will be suspect.Many other government agencies have been quick to target the FBI but how often has the public heard of abuses in other agencies? The problem is not one agency but the capacity for infiltration or exploitation of government power for a special interest group, in this case organized crime in general. In many ways it is the people that are responsible for the flourishing of organized crime for without a market, these groups would not survive. And not everyone linked with organized crime groups became so voluntarily, some were born into it,others married into it, others flock to it because they lack real family structures in their own lives and this may be a group who does accept them. And some aspects of organized crime involve things which are more of moral nature than legal ones, such as gambling."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"In considering this book, all the customer reviews should be viewed as different ways of looking at this case-speculative but raising valid questions. Recent evidence released in the case suggest informants being used against one another and FBI knowledge of alleged hits in advance. On the surface it looks as if the FBI are the bad guys but another way of looking at it is that they may not have intervened to stop aggressive action between members of the same organized crime group, an internal matter. It may be that there is a line and two worlds: one is the law and law obeying and the other is organized crime with the harsh pentalties that go along with infractions.Once one steps over that line, one might be held accountable to the side they are on. Organized crime is not known for benevolence and often times organized crime being 'nice' might simply mean they are not harming but not helping either.Just as agents in the FBI or law enforcement risk their lives,so too do individuals getting into organized crime.Law enforcement and organized crime might be viewed as the 2 sides of the same coin.Organized crime is about loyalty, greed, discipline,betrayal,daring,trust,violence.In organized crime the member holds loyalty to the organization above family members or their own children. In the FBI and any of these field-based law enforcement groups, individual agents can be taken away from their families for extended periods, have to work odd hours and such and this can tear a family apart. There have been a lot of allegations in this case,but we don't know why such harsh measures may have been required by the FBI. Was the FBI running wild or was organized crime? If it was the FBI, what does this say about internal controls to stop it? If organized crime, what does this say about it?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"One thing thse general public does not seem to be aware of and i have learned from past contact with numerous agencies is that many government employees are hedging on lucrative careers in the private sector after leaving the agency they work with. This is as true of the FBI as it is with EPA,OSHA, FDA and on and on. So when someone goes to a government agency with a complaint the losses that individual has suffered are counterbalanced by concerns of rocking the boat with a future employer.Many many government employees leave their positions for work within major companies and there is an informal exchange and network between existing and previous government employees. Like with the Jai Alai executive in this case, H Paul Rico left the FBI and went to work for Newport Jai Alai. Connolly left and took an executive position with Boston Edison. This sort of thing is commonplace and makes one reconsider what one's upward mobility in the corporate world really is. Another way of looking at this case is : does the government itself view whistleblowers and citizens who come forward with complaints as enemies of the state? Is the govt essentially a reactive entity and those who come forward prompting it to action considered acting contrary to the interests of freedom and democracy by urging the govt to exert tighter control?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"We have heard a lot about Bulger,Flemmi, Connolly.. but what about H.Paul Rico, Dennis Condon his partner, Agent Morris and Sonny Mercurio? What of the various agents we have heard little about? There are alleged to be roughly a dozen or more agents potentially involved. And why has the CIA not had something to say about this case? H.Paul Rico recruited Flemmi,Flemmi recruited Bulger. Who authorized Rico to recruit Flemmi and what was to be the scope of Flemmi's mission? We don't really know who is telling the truth in this case... Either Connolly is not or the government is making enormous efforts to make him look like he is not telling the truth. One of the things that is disturbing here is that Morris was given immunity in return for testifying that he accepted gifts and bribes from Flemmi and Bulger. But instead of holding Morris accountable, all is blamed on Flemmi and Bulger. Why doesn't the government offer immunity to Bulger,Flemmi and Connolly to get the full truth? How could Connolly help run an operation such as this for nearly 3 decades without FBI or Justice Dept interference or support? Is it possible that the government and organized crime compete in the same things?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"The Mclean-Mclaughlin Wars began in the 1960s, but how was the conflict resolved and more importantly how did it began? Was it the result of economic concerns between the forces who were set on the boomin space industry in Massachusetts and the forces loyal to the Boston Navy Yard? In the early 1960s around the time of the sinking of the USS Thresher off Portsmouth,NH, the Defense Investigative Service is said to have been formed. Was the sinking of the Thresher related indirectly to competing interests between the Boston and Portmouth Navy Yards at the same time the Boston Navy Yard was competing with NASA in Massachusetts? A group of workmen transferred from the Boston Navy Yard to the Portsmouth Navy yard not long before it sunk ,according to local newspapers. These events seemed to happen in roughly the same time period, the early 1960s. The Thresher sank in August,1963 and causes from faulty welding to backwards installation of back pressure relief valves were cited in hearings involving military personnel.And what of the children who survived from the gang wars that tore families apart? Were children of various warring factions abandoned and left into state child care, or were some of these kids grouped together and raised together to foster a new generation of compatible and close knit adults to reconcile the animosities that precipitated the Mclean-Mclaughlin wars to begin with?And were many of the players in this case approved for varying levels of clearances and agency affiliations? And how do we know that Flemmi,Bulger, Connolly weren't routinely monitored by the govt, such as their financial records,credit cards, bank accounts, or even phone calls and phone records?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I found this book to be riveting and compelling! The charm and allure of a gangster and an agent who both seemed to be enamored by the other's power. Whitey and John are cut from the same cloth; both are big men with little souls. They are more concerned about their image than what effect their actions have on their families and friends. Whitey is at least true to his calling- he becomes a big crook in a small city. John is not true to anyone- he becomes a braggart and a liar. Neither is even a friend to the other in the true sense. A modern day tragedy! In reading this book I wondered however, about the hundreds of other agents who were a daily part of John's life. Didn't any of them know or protest about this agent's dealing with a known mobster? The authors allude to agents who had run-ins and difficulties with the &quot;two Johns&quot; but didn't bother to investigate or include the many who must have questioned these two agents and their motives. As a reader who has two family members who are agents in the F.B.I., I found this book to be lacking in objectivity and too focused on the &quot; bad cop&quot;. A great book that leaves us either thinking that all agents are crooks or that the &quot; good cop&quot; doesn't make a good story."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"In this case and perhaps ongoing is a lot of people manipulating each other with the government presenting itself as master manipulator.I have an acquaintance i'll dub \\"Harry\\". \\"Harry\\" began having unusual problems when the fallout from Bulger's sudden disapearance began.For example: as the court action began and Boston media coverage hyped up,an individual i'll dub \\"Luke\\" appeared in Harry's life as a temporary coworker. As the 'friendship' matured, it became evident to Harry something was up. \\"Luke\\" began indicating he knew Harry's personal video rentals. Harry rented from a small store in which a new employee, dubbed \\" Peter\\" worked. Harry confronted Peter as to whether the store was giving out personal info and Peter denied it.Luke then began telling Harry he was watching him where he worked out and began tailing him around town while badgering Harry to be invited to his home without explanation.The store Harry went to was owned by what the papers called a Governor Paul Cellucci supporter.A couple years later Harry went to another video store and this time saw Peter from the previous store now working here. Suddenly Harry had a series of missing videos and the store was claiming he owed hundreds in late fees even though the store had never indicated there was a problem nor would management discuss it with him. The point here is that Harry progressively began getting setup.Harry confronted Luke and Luke did not deny being with the FBI. Harry had no criminal record of any kind.Harry feels there is some unknown link between the Bulger case and him he has never been told.

In addition to car tampering, phone surveillance and tampering,pretense bogus job interviews (interviews staged to gather information where the subject does not know they are being investigated nor why) and the like,here are some other things which happened:1) At 3 separate video stores, whenever the man used the drop box to return movies or DVDs,the movies mysteriously disappeared, causing a liability against the account and casting a pallor on the man. The first time it happened the store was owned by a supporter of Governor Paul Cellucci. During this time the man was being followed everywhere by a man who claimed to know what banking transactions he had made, where he ate and exactly what movies were rented. Eventually, when confronted as to whether this man was with the FBI and if he had been under investigation, the man neither confirmed nor denied it.The man had befriended this man as a congenial coworker from the same town,setting the stage for the pretense. At the first video store a clerk working there denied revealing rnetal records. Two years later the man rented from another store, dropped them in the box and this same clerk from the OTHER store was receiving them. Later the man found out the movies disappeared and his account was never credited. The man had no criminal history nor known ties to the Bulger case but a great deal of harassment blaming him for the Bulger case came down."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There is a man referred to obliquely in the prior reviews who has been seriously affected by all of this and essentially left for dead if you will. The man was bounced around as a child overseen by state authorities contracting to nonprofit firms employing former federal officials. One of the state officials charged with guardianship of the boy went by the same name as a female FBI agent listed in Black Mass by O'Neill and Lehr. Another woman charged with guardianship of the boy ran a hard labor camp for juveniles in trouble with the law, where breaking granite boulders with sledgehammers was the norm as was poor food,inadequate rest and mandatory employment where this woman demanding oversight of the teen's paychecks.At the hard labor camp, which was tacitly approved by state social workers and caretakers,local police and allegedly state police, the boy was forced to work 12-15 hour days, often 7-14 days without showers, little sleep and poor quality meals in addition to constant threats of violence, being locked up by state officials or state police and having all of his personal belongings confiscated-- the boy had been sent to this program simply because he had no family or other supports and had NO trouble with the law prior to being put there. The woman in charge of the program possessed the same name as a major manufacturing firm located in southern New Hampshire. This placement was overseen by the state official bearing the same name as the female FBI agent. Some 15-20 years later, this woman re-emerged in the man's life as a girlfriend of a coworker.This same man was befriended as a boy by a couple with indirect alleged links to George Cashman and former Governor Cellucci. When this case broke, the couple disavowed the man.Susan Kelly in her book also discussed the possibility that the early stages of the Boston Strangler murders may have been linked to gangland violence in the wars around which Flemmi emerged. A woman is said to have survived the Strangler but was never interviewed. Is it possible the Boston Strangler in turn is linked to this case ,got a woman pregnant, and the child was used as some sort of collateral for cooperation of the real Strangler?At the same time, Jonathan Harr released his book 'A Civil Action' just after Whitey fled town. When the book came out, the man worked for Grace Co.,unaware of his past as a very young,sick and handicapped boy growing up in the chaos of an environmental tragedy in Woburn,Mass. The fervor surrounding Harr's work appeared in sync with the tepid waters of the Bulger case, and during the early phases of the hearings, Robert Redford and Sylvester Stallone appeared in a Somerville court for ambiguous reasons regarding the Bulger case. Prior to Harr's work, the man had written an autobiographical work of his own which touched upon memories of a sick child in Woburn during the emergence of the cancer epidemic.As the Bulger case broiled, Barry Mawn, native of Woburn, was assigned to the Boston FBI office in pursuit of Bulger- Mawn, Teddy Roosevelt to Cuba, Mawn to Woburn. Many of the Bulger case principals had indirect ties to Woburn and surrounding communities.In addition to all of this, the man's medical records began disappearing, and employment became all but impossible as he was destroyed financially, just as the state trooper who stopped Whitey at Logan airport.Evidence of phone tampering emerged possibly using off premise extensions linked to major companies the man worked for which also did business with the federal government. The man's bank records and video rentals have been scrupulously monitored and broad evidence of a long term evidence gathering investigation of an individual with no history of criminal activity or breaking the law. It seems feasible the man is linked to the Bulger case and has been watched by various agencies who feel threatened by his father, a man unknown to the boy growing up or as an adult.One thing a government oversight or other committee might investigate is the possibility that one of the principals in the Bulger case on either side had a son who was immediately flagged and watched all of his life and used as surety without his knowledge by the government or perhaps even organized crime. The committee might offer protection and encourage that individual to come forward and disclose all they know."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"In this case you have a number of political considerations in the context in which this case mushroomed.Governor Paul Cellucci, a supporter of George Bush,Jr., received widespread state police support and support from Fleet Bank. Joe Malone received support from Fidelity, Scott Harshbarger the investment sector. The state police and DEA in this book are noted as being hampered in their investigations of Bulger while in the recent past state police leaks have been detected to Bulger. State Senator James Jajuga,a Democrat and former state trooper, pledged support to Paul Cellucci, a Republican, garnering local Democrat party dissent.FBI agents have been alleged to receive appliances (perhaps appliance repair services also) and numerous other perks courtesy of Connolly and Bulger.

You judge for yourself...1) Not long before this case became a media event, the man ('ManX' we'll call him) had a lengthy news story printewd about his search for his unknown father. Whitey disappeared and all hell broke loose in this man's life.2) The man had a brother born by a different name who then changed his name to this ManX's last name.Around this time another man appeared bearing the same name as ManX and who seemd to be living a parallel life intertwined with ManX,as if creating an alter ego for ManX.Over the next 20 years, this alter ego would cross paths with ManX from time to time,with the imposter using ManX as a fallguy.At one point the imposter went AWOL claiming he was ManX from the army.ManX was not in the military.Could any of this have involved friends of Flemmi in the military?3) ManX was in the custody of the courts when Bulger was officially signed on to Top Echelon.At this point new individuals were introduced to the boy as positive influences. Things went well although these new influences kept a distance and frequently filed reports on their interaction with the boy. When Bulger fled in 1995 these same individuals suddenly turned their backs on ManX and even used false names when contact was attempted.It was later revealed that some of these individuals might be tied to influential parties linked to George Cashman of the Teamsters.ManX knew none of this. All ManX knew was that these people had shown him kindness.4) ManX became a target for numerous individuals claiming affiliation with the Justice Dept. or FBI without being asked about this. The result was that ManX became all but totally unemployable.It was as if ManX was either being targeted by individuals with the FBI/DOJ, supporters of such employees or individuals with another agenda trying to make out a link with the FBI/DOJ.5) There was increased evidence of possible documentary sanitation with respect to ManX's upbringing at an accelerated pace when this case bubbled up in the media.ManX wrote an autobiography and this appeared to stir up serious concern.6) Since the case emerged in 1995,ManX has been almost completely without health insurance,kept in poverty and been maneuvered into bankruptcy,homelessness and much more. It is as if an attempt to destroy the man financially,spiritually and emotionally has been underway ever since Bulger fled, just like what happened to the state trooper at Logan airport who crossed Bulger once.7) The man had as caretakers of various kinds at least 2-3 people with the same names as FBI personnel in this case.8) Could ManX be the child of a principal in this case with the plan of turning ManX into an informant to replace Flemmi and Bulger and something went wrong,so incurring the wrath of the DOJ?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Bulger has been affiliated with former Governor Mike Dukakis of Northeastern University and Amtrak.

How many people were involved in the choice? Do informants go through normal security clearance oversight?It has become apparent that informants were used against each other and that many have gone to jail rather than reveal their informant status. This case might make one reconsider becoming an informant or working for the FBI or Justice Dept.During the Vietnam protests, it has been said that some police officers dressed up in riot gear using the badge of an officer who called in sick and then proceeded to dole out harsh punishments for protesters.This is the sort of thing we dread and must be vigilant in monitoring.Perhaps this case was a reaction to escalating violence that precipitated harsher and harsher responses from law enforcement. Is it possible many people were in danger and these guys were called in as the heavies?Where did Bulger and Flemmi learn such alleged brutality? Have their families been punished simply for being their family? Were Flemmi and Bulger and Mercurio preselected from early on in their lives? Have their successors been selected,perhaps without even their knowledge?The concentration here is just with the FBI..but what of other branches of the Justice Dept? Or government in general? What does the handling of informants in the case tell us about how the Justice Dept and the general public view them?It seems that the roles Flemmi and Bulger and Mercurio played were extremely risky and without the backup of normal law enforcement support. It may also be that these guys were processed in security clearances areas and that once this happened their prospects of legitimate work in industry were jeopardized. One coworker said that a govt agency(not FBI) targeted him for recruitment so aggressively that they allegedly sent agents to his workplace,neighbors and such and spread rumors such that he got a bad reputation and could not find work.

Whitey signed up in the mid-1970s.In the 1980s, 'X'now a teen, lived in Middlesex county while another person going by the same name and same town popped up and began having his mail diverted to this new man's address. Over the next 10 years, this man appeared to follow the teen as he became a man, calling his workplaces and leaving his name, moving to the same towns, and even attending the same church wherever this boy went. Once 'X' was nearly arrested for being AWOL, as this man was in the army and had used his address.In the 1990s 'X' had a local newspaper article detailing his search for his unknown father.Not long after the editors and reporting staff changed and claimed no knowledge of their predecessors. After that, the man lost his job, began getting getting threatening calls and to be followed by men in suitsas well as plainclothes. on at least one occasion one of the plainclothes men was referred to as \\"Mr. Ring\\". An older man moved into the apartment complex beside 'X' and across from a unit where a woman claiming to do \\" acccounting for the government\\" lived.This man had Tennessee license plates,carried a revolver and claimed to work construction. Weeks later the man was seen driving a phone company truck and moved out immediately afterwards.But not before being seen laying cables from his apartment to the one across the hall.Barry Mawn, formerly of a Tennessee FBI office,was newly assigned Boston SAC. 'X',attending Northeastern University,suddenly began having problems with some instructors who appeared to have an unknown hostility to 'X'.Northeastern is where Agent Morris and R.Robert Popeo had affiliation. In addition to having many.many problems with his phones,'X' began courting malice from a group of 10(10 is the number of alleged secret witnesses against Whitey)who used threats and intimidation and coercion to keep the man constantly in fear and blamed him for \\"what is going on..\\" in the Bulger case. Since all of this,the man has been destroyed completely financially and careerwise and questions have been raised if FBI personnel have been monitoring the man and interfering with employment and communications as well as assuring financial destruction(like a state trooper was by Bulger).The man went to the Justice Department to seek help and was blown off by the Justice Management division while taps and traces by local police were ineffective against the hostile calls.Additionally, the man repeatedly got daily blank phone messages from a phone linked to MBNA offices in Florida, where Paul Rico lived and which corporation Louis Freeh later became a senior Vice President of.Since ,Trooper Foley, the champion in this case, has retired, the Government Reform hearings are closed, and there seems to be no one who can hold the FBI accountable."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"No one has brought up the possibility that Bulger or some other principles in this case might have had children and perhaps an arrangement was made between Bulger or the affected parties and the government but Bulger or others learned that the children had been given a life of misery and contempt,perhaps abused abandoned or neglected and that the whole plan for their roles as informants may have been based on a lie. What if children were held hostage or deliberately placed in harm's way to control players in this case?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I enjoyed this and learned a lot. Perhaps the only thing more interesting than the case itself might be what the life of a child of Whitey Bulger might have been like. While Flemmi and Bulger were considered gangsters only, if it was known Bulger had children, then those reating the child well might be said to be sympathetic to the Bulger gangster persona. Then when it was revealed Bulger and Flemmi worked for the FBI,those who had treated Bulger's children badly would realize their mistake and the gangster-friendly people might suddenly hate the children. If Burton wants to understand this case fully in his committee he should locate if Bulger had children, offer them protection and interview them. It might just be that additional victims in the form of children used as bait can be found."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"In 1995, when Bulger fled, there was a man who was old enough to be Bulger's son who suddenly seemed to become a target. The man's medical records became unavailable right back to birth, and longtime associates the man knew for decades with strong ties back to the Boston area began getting hostile to this person as well as anxious about the Bulger case fallout in sync.It was as if this person had ties to the Bulger case unknown to them but which was known by these older individuals with roots to Boston prior to the ascent of these guys.The key to this whole case might be if Bulger had children and how those children have been dealt with. If Dan Burton can locate and interview exhaustively this man,then Bulger might be more understandable.Could a child of Bulger's have been put under witness protection or the US Marshall's service and not even know it?"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book --which I am in the process of reading-- takes on a classic problem involving police informants. Sometimes, the &quot;snitch&quot; gains the upper hand in his or her relationship with the law enforcement agency involved. This is precisely what happened in the Bulger case. Except it wasn't just a situation with one policeman crossing the line but a group of them. And the misconduct went beyond the ordinary to the point where the tail was quite literally wagging the dog.So far, my impression of &quot;Black Mass&quot; is very favorable. It appears meticulously researched and is written in an easy to read style. My one complaint is that the biographical details on Bulger are a little sketchy in places. Specifically, the authors only briefly mention what Bulger did before he got out of prison. I would have found it useful to know more about what he was doing while &quot;in the can&quot; and before.Yet I'd rather have less biographical details from that period than too many (which is a mistake some authors make --overwhelming their readers with a crushing amount of trivia)."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Interesting journalistic account of the Bulger Mob and its connections to the government.

The authors are more than qualified to write on the topic, as they have followed the story as it happened in the Boston Globe. The allegations are mostly cited, but it is obvious some creative story telling was used also. This does however, give you great insite as to the connection between Whitey and the South Boston FBI. A page turner for sure!"},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"A very disturbing look into organized crime and it's associations with the Boston branch of the FBI. Boston politicos, Mafia informants and low-life criminals turn Beantown into a playground for greed, murder and a fast track to power. Amazingly, it took more than sixteen years to finally track down and capture Whitey Bolger. Complicity with law enforcement, shoddy police work or was Whitey just too clever? I can't wait for another installment of this dark and complicated saga."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book provides a rare glimpse inside the working and background of Whitey Bulger and the FBI. Based on extensive interviews and court case transcripts it's a sad but true accounting."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"I had never heard that the history of Whitey Bulger and his Southie gang were the true motivation behind the film The Departed. My love for Martin Scorsese's classic is what made me purchase this book though. I had originally read that The Departed was a remake of a Chinese film about a criminal police infiltrator and a police informer. No other references were made at the time (at least with the reviews I read). Black Mass is the true story of South Boston and the way in which two criminals--Bulger and Steve Flemmi--corrupted completely two members of the FBI along with several other fellow travelling agents. The book is riveting and when I finished it I was left wishing there were another 100 pages to get through."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"There have been many books on the subject of James J. \\"Whitey\\" Bulger and his relationship with the FBI. However, this is the best. I read this book many years ago when the scandal was first breaking, and my only complaint after reading it once again recently is that it was written too soon."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"A well written, researched, and tragically true tale of police corruption that looked the other way or even worse, probably helped in murders of over 20 people. At all levels of government, local, state, and federal, sworn law enforcement concealed, tipped off, and covered up as Bulger savagely tortured and murdered numerous people, including young girls who wanted to break away from sexual abusers. FBI agents partied with Bulger, scared off witnesses, and falsified the record going so far as let innocent people rot for crimes. Bulger was promoted as a 'hero' who kept drugs and crime out of his neighborhood - ignoring the fact Bulger was terrorizing, extorting, and sexually assaulting almost directly in front of law enforcement. At the end, the reader wonders why extremely few of these enablers came to trial, where the others are now and if the FBI is really looking for Whitey Bulger. Great read, I think it's enhanced by reading the Howie Carr book,The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century. The Black Mass authors seem to imply some good in law enforcement at the start while Carr takes a much harsher view. As an example, when the Rakes family built up a liquor market from scratch, Bulger and his thugs simultaneously assaulted husband and wife at different locations, threatened them in front of their children and threatened their children in front of them. Bulger forced them to give him the market. The Rakes went to an uncle who was a local cop and there Black Mass and Howie Carr split. Black Mass says the uncle cop went to the FBI and was waved off while Carr implies the uncle immediately informed Whitey. In both tales, the Rakes immediately found out that the law wasn't their friend as Whitey became even more abusive and violent toward them. Carr adds that the uncle was convicted and sent to prison for other corruption just a few months later. Black Mass seems to cover these details much less. It'd be a five but for issues like that.Good book, great read, highly reccommend it, will make you both sick and angry."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"This book was written by the same New England journalist team that wrote The Underboss and is a supplement to that book.After reading it you'll see why Whitey Bulger is right at the top of the FBI's most wanted list.The more appalling theme of the book however is the complete criminal corruption of a number of FBI agents by the Irish mob.Two FBI agents in particular John Connally and John Morris,who were the FBI heroes in the book The Underboss are the archvillains in Black Mass.The book is highly readable and well researched.Apparently the Irish mob had a criminal \\"cakewalk\\" for over 30 years in Boston. The reason:the FBI monomaniacally focused its attention on bringing down the Italian Mafia and used the Irish mob to do it. Unfortunately the Irish Mob was as dangerous as the Italian Mob.Connally and Morris continually overlooked,promoted,and refused to even acknowledge the criminal activity of the Irish mob under Jim Bulger.According to the book,the information gained on the Italian Mafia by Jim Bulger was not even that significant.The FBI even provided the Irish mob with info that resulted in the murder of a few state witnesses by the Bulger murder crew.The last part of the book has Bulgers' criminal associate Steve Flemmi,turning states evidence to save his hide.The FBI plainly let this investigation \\"snowball\\" out of control accompanied with \\"all the trimmins\\",entrapment,murder,etc. I was reading in another book about the same subject that there are still victim lawsuits in the works from this mess."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"The scene is Boston, starting in the 1970s. The FBI has made it a top priority to clamp down on organized crime (in this case, the Mafia, populated by the Italians of North Boston). John Connolly, a very young FBI agent, is called to the Boston office to work in the Organized Crime unit. The idea was that if he could find someone to rat out the Italians, the FBI's job would be made much easier. Connolly begins to cultivate James (Whitey) Bulger, a former acquaintance from Connolly's old neighborhood in South Boston. Bulger was a career criminal, beginning his future occupation as a young boy, and he and one of his associates, Steve Flemmi, had ties to the Italian mob in Boston. Whitey was also part of a gang in Southie. He became an informant for the FBI, and in return, he was given protection by the FBI. His information was very helpful and did help to put away some of the Mafia guys, but in the meantime, he also gave info on anyone in South Boston that he considered might be standing in his own way as he rose up through the ranks of the criminal underworld. The authors, Lehr and O'Neill, used a variety of first-hand sources to not only write this book, but to break the entire story in the Boston Globe. What they examine here is basically the true cost of the information provided by Bulger. While he's giving them good information, he's also being allowed to literally get away with murder. I won't go further into this book, but I picked it up the other night and could hardly put it down once I started. I guarantee you that if you have an interest in organized crime, this is a no-miss story. I would like to say that I was appalled by the sheer abuse of power from members of an institution created to protect the American public, but frankly, it's getting harder and harder to be surprised any more. Very well written and very taut; I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in organized crime, the FBI, in the so-called Irish Mob in the United States or in true crime in general."},{"Title":"Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob","review":"Just could't put it down.

Being Irish and growing up in the same neighbourhood built a stronger bond that what side on the law they were working for. The FBI detective John Connolly and the people around him managed to include the fearsome leader as an informant to get information on the Italian mob, and in return keep him informed and sheltered from the police/authorities. The authors (Boston Globe reporters) managed to uncover this unbelievable and compelling story. The book is well written and keeps up the excitment from start to finish."},{"Title":"Myths of the Norsemen: Retold from the old Norse poems and tales","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Norse mythology for young readers. The individual myths are set down in a logical order so that the reader can understand the religious belief system of the ancient Norse people. I do not recommend this book to any adult who would enjoy a more in depth read on the subject; however, it would be a good read for an adult who just wants a quick and enjoyable overview of the subject.I wish more children of European ancestry would embrace their heritage and read up on the myths of their folk. We can all learn a lot about who we are by studying the beliefs that are actually native to our respective peoples."},{"Title":"Myths of the Norsemen: Retold from the old Norse poems and tales","review":"Edith Hamilton commented in her book Mythology that unfortunately, no-one had ever woven together the Norse myths into a single epic, similar to the Iliad or the Odyssey. Roger Lancelyn Green has certainly do the best job of it so far. Many people have put together a book that selects among the variant myths, but no one else has ever put them together into such a readable and moving story. It is a great piece of literature in its own right, in addition to being a relatively simple telling of the myths.Anyone wanting a more scholarly approach may want to find another book, such asThe Mythology of All Races.

Stranger in the Woods gave me the feeling that the photos could stand on their own at least as well as they could with the text. Lost in the Woods, however, has a definite storyline to help the images along. I don't appreciate the fairly meaningless repetition of sounds (like \\"chickadee-dee-dee\\") any more than I did in the first book, but it doesn't stick out as badly here. I felt a little thrown when I got to a point in the storyline that seemed to be the climax/ending and found that the book didn't end there, but the story is good overall. The photos are charming, and the back of the book features a selection of critter pictures to go back and find within the larger photos. There's a lot to look at here."},{"Title":"Lost In The Woods: A Photographic Fantasy","review":"Poor little fawn, did he lose his mother? That was the first thought I had in mind when I read the book, Lost in the Woods, by Carl R. Sams and Jean Stoick published in 2004. This book is full of beautiful photographs that tell the story of a lonely little fawn in the woods and all the baby animals that are curious about his being there. The different animals are trying to figure out if he is lost but the fawn reassures them all that his mother will be back soon. The mother does indeed come back and the fawn is now allowed to go along and explore the world around him. He gets stronger and is able to frolic through the grassy hills with his mother.There is a curiosity that only children have and I think these baby animals represented exactly that. They all are very interested in who this fawn is and where his mother is and try to give the fawn advice. I am sure that children reading the book will be curious about it as well. The photographs are wonderful and really capture the emotion in every page. There is a photo of a red-winged blackbird with its wings spread out so beautifully and a photo of the doe licking her fawn with such love. At the end of the book there are pictures of other animals that are hidden in the photos throughout the book. This gives the children a chance to take a second look to see new things on the same pages they have already read. This is a good way to add a fun game to reading. Overall, I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Lost In The Woods: A Photographic Fantasy","review":"This book is an outstanding one for all ages, illustrated with incredibly beautiful wildlife photographs.

This time it is a photographic pictorial of spring and its new arrivals. The photographs are magnificent (as one would expect from Carl Sams) and the text is clearly written and appropriate to the subject: not too much, not too little, but just right. The colors are intense, especially the greens. LITW is a book that will please children from ages one to one hundred and one with its many young animals, new spring flora, musical prose, and hidden woodland creatures which can be found upon more intense scrutiny.The storyline has to do with the arrival of spring and new life in a woodland and its surrounding meadow. Leaves on the trees suddenly burst forth in refreshing greens, flowers bloom, and animal babies arrive, each wondering when will be their time to roam or fly freely about the world into which they were born. Several of the young wonder about a newborn fawn that appears to have been left alone by its mother, not understanding, of course, that there's a very good reason for this. The fawn believes Mother will return, as she certainly does. The story is told by Shirley the box turtle to Fernando Hernadofandavez, a most comical young raccoon who is looking for his brother, Hernando. He's a stitch!There is also a DVD of LITW available (if you think the raccoon was funny in the book, wait \`til you catch him on film with a voice).

Any one who would stand up to the pope and say 'I'd rather die than convert' (when trying to get the Roman Catholic Church to drop 'conversion of the Jews' as an official aim of the church) has the sort of integrity of belief and identity that I aspire to and most likely will never attain.Heschel's book \`The Prophets' became an almost instant classic. Simply reading through the chapter titles and subtitles (a partial list of titles appears at the bottom of this review) will give a sense of the breadth and depth of this work.Heschel sees an urgent need for prophets and prophecy in today's world. 'The things that horrified the prophets are even now daily occurrences all over the world.' In examining the prophecies of Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Nathan, &c;, he discerns the common strands of the word of God in all that they said and did, and teaches the reader how to discern similar prophetic aspects in today's world.\`The prophet is human, yet he employs note one octave too high for our ears.'The Bible says, let him who has ears to hear, listen. Alas, ordinarily we do not have the hearing range to be able to give adequate attention and comprehension to today's prophetic voices. Most often the voice of the prophet is one we do not want to hear (look at how the Israelites reacted to their prophets!). Prophets were often seen as doom-sayers and problematic people.Indeed, every prediction of disaster is in itself an exhortation to repentance. The prophet is sent not only to upbraid, but to 'strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees.'Every prophetic utterance, according to Heschel, has to have within its core a message of hope. Without hope, without a promise to greater community and participation in the love of God, there is no true prophecy. The road may be hard and long, involving pain and even death, but in the end, the prophet's goal is greater life for all.\`To be a prophet is both a distinction and an affliction.'Being a prophet has never been a chosen profession.

He is a person who stands in the presence of God.'The prophet becomes one with God in many ways, yet remains a human being. This creates a tension in the prophet, as Heschel writes about Isaiah:\`Indeed, two sympathies dwell in a prophet's soul: sympathy for God and sympathy for the people. Speaking to the people, he is emotionally at one with God; in the presence of God, beholding a vision, he is emotionally at one with the people.'Yet prophecy has its limits.\`A prophet can give man a new word, but not a new heart....

While non-Jews tend to think of &quot;prophets&quot; as psychics who foretell the future, the Jewish concept of a prophet is someone who is inspired by God to advance the cause of social justice by confronting the people and their rulers. &quot;Feed the widow, the orphan, the stranger!&quot; shouts the prophet in the marketplace. &quot;Forsake your dead idols -- return to the Lord!&quot; he tells the king. Yes, the prophet may foretell future events, but he also preaches another option: return to the ways of God, and the terrible things foretold in a prophecy may not have to happen. A prophecy is a warning, a call to repentence -- not a prognistication written in stone.Heschel's scholarship in this work is excellent and very, very readable, even if you are not a seminarian. Like his shorter books, such as &quot;The Sabbath&quot; and &quot;The Earth is the Lord's,&quot; this work is written in dynamic, inspiring prose that reaches the level of fine literature. In the first volume, he discusses specific biblical prophets such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc. (Christians may be surprised to learn that, in classical Jewish sources, the &quot;suffering servant&quot; refers Jacob who, in turn, is used by Isaiah as a metaphor for the entire Jewish people collectively. In other words, the Jews are the &quot;suffering servant&quot; of God, not Jesus.) Volume II discusses more general concepts about prophets and prophecy.As an historical note, I would add that Rabbi Heschel not only wrote about prophets and social responsibility, he also walked the walk -- quite literally. He was active in the Civil Rights movement in the USA, and walked with Dr. Martin Luther King in the second Selma march in Alabama (look for a white-haired man in a black skullcap near King, next time you view footage of that event.) Rabbi Heschel said of that march that he &quot;felt as if his feet were praying.&quot; His book, &quot;The Prophets,&quot; will let you enter the mind and soul that went with those feet."},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"If you're looking to find some reading that will stretch you limitations, this book will do nicely. First of all, this is not a commentary about the books of the prophets so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. This book is largely a look at the sociological and psychological aspects of being a prophet.This book challenges you to look at the world from a probable perspective of the man and not necessarily the mission, although these subjects are covered at an aggregate level.The author transports the vivid reader into the mind of a prophet and helps one understand the frustrations, depression, and sense of injustice that the propet may have felt. The prophet is not dehumanized to demigod status like most other readings on the subject. The prophet is viewed as sympathetic to God and in tune with the message. These men feel the emotion.What I find most appealing is that the author allows God to have emotions which I find refreshing in light of the influence that Maimonides (whom I enjoy abundantly) has had on Judaic thought.The only negative, if any, is that this is not the most easy read, but what philosphy student likes light reading!"},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"Heschel's treatise on Old Testament prophets and prophecy greatly increased, even changed, my appreciation and understanding of God. God is a loving Father whose judgment and punishment are intended to turn men back to their Creator and Savior.

Amos, Hosea, Isaiah (Isa. 1-39), Micah, Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and Second Isaiah (Isa. 40-66) are analyzed with particular care given to their humanity as they encounter God and men in assuming their respective missions.Heschel describes his focus in writing: \\"What I have aimed at is an understanding of what it means to think, feel, respond, and act as a prophet (Introduction). For this Jewish rabbi and seminary professor, \\"the prophet is a person, not a mircrophone. He is endowed with a mission, with the power of a word not his own that accounts for his greatness--but also with temperament, concern, character, and individuality. As there was no resisting the impact of divine inspiration, so at times there was no resisting the vortex of his own temperament. The word of God reverberated in the voice of man\\" (Introduction). This examination of the prophets' humanity is most compelling throughout the work with the first chapter, \\"What Manner of Man is the Prophet?,\\" being worth the price of the set to me.The second volume addresses at least sixteen different aspects of the prophetic experience, among them: \\"theology and philosophy of pathos,\\" \\"meaning and mystery of wrath,\\" \\"sympathy,\\" \\"ecstasy,\\" \\"poetry,\\" and \\"inspiration.\\" An examination of prophets from other cultural contexts is also included.Highly recommended to all theologically- and philosophically-minded readers who are interested in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the Hebrew prophets from a Jewish perspective."},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I've read in my life. I am particularly interested in the relationship between the sacred and the secular and using one to illuminate the other. Most writers tend to lean too heavily on one and too heavily against the other. While Abraham Heschel is clear in his beliefs, his faith does not prevent him from thinking about the secular world in ways that enhance my understanding of both the sacred and the secular.While these books (actually a two volume set in one cover) specifically address the Prophets of the Old Testament, Heschel constantly explores the prophet construct through virtually every useful idea in human intellectual history. This is more than a biography of the Prophets, but rather a deep examination of what the concept \\"prophet\\" means and how it compares and contrasts with other religious, ethical, spiritual, and humanistic perspectives.If you view theology and faith through the lens of someone like Christopher Hitchens (whose current 2007 atheist manifesto and sacred attack is a bestseller now), then \\"The Prophets\\" is probably a book you wouldn't like because its foundation is folly, fatuous, and infamous. If, however, you can think about the sacred and the secular - like Fitzgerald's genius who can hold opposing ideas in his head simultaneously - you might find this one of the most interesting books you've ever read.In the same vein of the sacred-secular contrast, the latest books by the late Philip Rieff might also be interesting to you.

He identifies their major trait as a profound sensitivity to evil. This involved complete intolerance to injustice and indifference, an attitude often expressed in harsh words. The soul of the prophet was attuned to the cry of the afflicted. Driven by compassion, he protested vehemently.In addition, the prophets fiercely repudiated mankind's subservience to might, holding up the moral law in the place of force. Their view of violence as obscene and their sympathy for the weak were rare for that time. The theme that might is not right is inherent in their message. Unlike the lofty metaphysicians they focused on the mundane, the way people treat one another. The prophets also emphasized linear as opposed to cyclical time, bringing a promise of ultimate salvation.Heschel deals with individual prophets like Amos, who in his concern for Israel's neighbors made it clear that God cares for all nations. Hosea proclaimed that Israel is God's consort, the first Isaiah warned against foreign alliances while denouncing obstinacy and pride, while Micah distilled the essence of true worship: do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with the Divine.Gentle by nature, Jeremiah's anguish becomes clear as he had to convey messages of wrath and suffering. The first Isaiah and Habbakuk spoke of ultimate redemption through an outpouring of the Spirit whilst the second Isaiah proclaimed God's eternal love for Israel, His concern for all mankind and the idea of Israel as a light to the nations.The author shows that the prophets were torn in anguish between compassion for mankind and sympathy for God, acting as advocate for the one to the other. They constantly intervened, imploring mercy for the people whilst warning the powerful in explosive language against their abusive practices, and admonishing the whole nation for its lack of empathy. To quote Heschel: \`The opposite of freedom is not determinism, but hardness of heart.'It emerges that judgment is never final, that the gate of repentance remains open and that there is sorrow in the anger of the Lord. History is where justice suffers defeat but the prophets predicted future peace and salvation. Over and over they emphasized that kindness took precedence over wisdom, wealth or might. More than strict justice only, righteousness encompasses loving concern. The prophets proclaimed the divine pathos, revealing that the great judge is our Father too.This absorbing and completely unique work succeeds in making many things clear, on both a mental and emotional level. Written in graceful prose, the concepts are easy to understand while Heschel's words speak to the heart. The Prophets is one of the most moving and comforting books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"I truly enjoyed every aspect of this wonderful book written by a husband and wife team of excellence. They deserve commendation for writing such a book.I came away understanding how the Prophets were advancing the education of man and woman to abandon idols and worshiping these graven images. Instead they were telling men to believe in themselves by controlling their emotions and anger by seeking out a larger spiritual presence in the Supreme Being and the precepts they say were created from high above.The Western World is indeed indebted to Jewish thought, philosophy and attitudes towards social justice. It is time others who wish us harm understand the Jewish Culture is as much as a keystone to Western Civilization as Islam is to the Middle East and Buddhists are to the Orient. Respecting such concepts with tolerance is the work of G-d whether Jewish, Christian or Muslim.One of my favorites Prophets is Elijah. Few knew he was on the brink of suicide suffering from a great depression until he heard words from somewhere telling him he is needed for a greater purpose in life. Even more fascinating was his first reaction. As in most Prophets, he tried to reject his calling; he did not want to listen to the voice. Let alone take up the burden to speak out for social causes that needed changed. Yet, his will was bended by a more powerful force and he ended up saving many from atrocities, curing others, challenging authority that was abusing the people and teaching the world how to treat one another. What I cannot deny is that something changed this man to change us and that is recorded in history!Whether you are atheist, religious skeptic or outright spiteful towards religion, you will learn about the Prophets who have spoken to G-d. Their lives were real and existed telling us interesting stories whether you are a believer or Non-believer.I highly recommend this exquisite book of history. I will leave it to you to choose to believe what you wish and desire as always. As for me, I am one day more educated by reading this book and that suits me just fine today."},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"Before reading The Prophets by Abraham Heschel, I had thought of the writings of the Prophets as angry diatribes against the people they were intended for, but Heschel sees these men, on the one hand, as passionate lovers of God who must relate to their people the wrath of God and the consequences of their behavior, and on the other hand, vulnurable human beings themselves whose compassion for these same people moves them to beg God for mercy, for one more chance.One is also able to see, through Heschel's eyes, the tremendous love of God for these same people and even though they bring their troubles on themselves, God is always compassionate, forgiving, and eternally loving.Abraham Heschel's writings are not only profound and moving but also written in a flowing prose style that attracts the modern reader.I heartily recommend this book to fans of Heschel as well as to those who might see the Old Testament as a book of judgment and condemnation. Heschel will cure you of that."},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"Wow! This is the best book I have read in years! When I read books, I try to take notes, but books like that almost make me feel like I have copy large portions and portions of the book in my notebook for later reference. A while back I read F. B. Meyer on some of the characters of the Old Testament. I was turned off. Christian Fundamentalists don't help the situation either for me. They keep talking about judgement and anger and all these words that remind me of the god of Islam called Allah. But as I have come to read Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, I have come to rejoice in the God of the Old Testament and his judgement and be at peace when I hear about his anger. If I was still a Muslim and heard Rabbi Heschel and what he had to say about the Lord in the Hebrew Bible, I would have converted to Judaism right away. He reads the legacy of his Jewish mindset and not like those who read fragmented, mutilated passages here and there in order to justify their self-righteous \\"fire and brimstone\\" version of faith. On p. 21 Rabbi Heschel introduces us to the prophet. In my mind as a Muslim, the prophet was just a messenger. And in the Baptist seminary they taught us that the prophet is just \\"telling forth\\" what he hears from God. To me this sounds more like a mouthpiece, not too far from the Muslim concept of a prophet. In the Hebrew Bible the prophet claims to be far more than a messenger. He is a person who stands in the presence of God ( Jer. 15: 19), who stands \\"in the council of the Lord\\" ( Jer. 23: 18), who is a participant, as it were, in the council of God, not a bearer of dispatches whose function is being limited to sent on errands. He is a counselor as well as a messenger. In Amos 3: 7, we read \\"Surely the Lord God does nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets\\". In Islam, the prophet is nothing more than a mouthpiece who conveys what is told to him verbatim, mechanical dictation. Never is it so in the Hebrew Bible. That is why people make huge mistakes when they say that the God of Islam is the same as the God of the Old Testament or that Mohammad functioned like any prophet in the Hebrew Bible. Not really. They can just wish all they want. This secret of the Lord that the Lord is dying to reveal to His servants to the prophets, as Amos has already told us, is one of awe. Yet the prophet does not hesitate to challenge the intention of the Lord, something that never happens in Islam. Yet here the prophet says to the Lord, \\"Oh Lord God, forgive I beseech Thee! How can Jacob stand? He is so small!\\". When the lives of others are at stake, the prophet does not say \\"Thy will be done\\" but rather \\"Thy will be changed\\". in Amos 7: 3, the prophets reports that he had a way with God and \\"The Lord repented concerning this; It shall not be, said the Lord\\". Rabbi Heschel assures us the that the prophet does not prove anything. He is not in the business of arguing his message. He is merely a witness. As a witness, the the prophet is more than a messenger... and as a messenger he bears witness that the Lord is divine. Mohammad used to argue and curse those who will not agree with his message of Islam and made it a divine mandate to curse those who will not be subjugated to his religion. This is called mubahalah in Islam. Read Family of Imran verse 61. Essentially it is, if we don't reach an agreement and you don't convert to a Muslim as a result of the debate, let us raise our hands to the sky and vehemently curse those who refuse to convert to Islam. On the other hand, the prophet in Hebrew Bible is not interest in the least to argue or prove anything to you. He is just a witness. He bears witness to the message he received from his Lord. The thought he has to convey is more than the language can contain. Divine power bursts in the words. The authority of the prophet is in the Presence His words reveal. You just have to hear his words and sense the power coming from the Presence behind them and they are to cut to the core of our hearts. This prophet didn't have to worry about Richard Dawkins or worry himself about giving proofs for anything. The prophet had the right concept: there are no proofs for the existence of the God of Abraham. There are only witnesses. The greatness of the prophet lies not in the ideas expressed, but also in the moments he experienced. As a witness, he experienced his moments with the Lord he has been with, and his words are a testimony to that- to God's power and judgement, to His justice and mercy. If we look for prophetic coherence, it won't be in what the prophet says but of WHOM he speaks. Indeed, not even the word of God is the ultimate object and the theme of his consciousness. The ultimate object and theme of his consciousness is God, of Whom the prophet knows that above his judgement and above his anger stands His mercy. On p. 24 Rabbi Heschel states that the attitude that the prophet takes to the tension that obtains between God and the people is characterized by dichotomy. In the presence of God he takes the part of the people. In the presence of the people he takes the part of God. On p. 25, he says that the conception of the prophet as nothing but mouthpieces, the assumption that their hearts remain unaffected, would almost compel us to apply to them the words that Jeremiah used of the people in chapter 12 verse 2, \\"Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart\\". The prophet is not a mouthpiece, but a person; not an instrument, but a partner, an associate of God.In chapter 2, Rabbi Heschel deals with concept that we all know, Israel being the chosen people of God. He explains that from the beginnings of the Israelite religion the belief that God had chosen this particular people to carry out his mission has been both a cornerstone of Hebrew faith and a refuge in moments of distress. What Rabbi Heschel is so important for Muslims to hear, especially Palestinian Muslims who chose Atheism as they accuse the God of the Old Testament of being a racist god. Rabbi Heschel says, the prophet had to remind the people that chosenness must not be mistaken as divine favoritism or immunity from chastisement, but, on the contrary, that it meant being more seriously exposed to divine judgement and chastisement. In Amos 3: 1-2, he says,1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt: 2 \\"You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.Does chosenness mean that God is exclusively concerned with Israel? Does the Exodus from Egypt imply that God is involved only in the history of Israel and is oblivious of the fate of other nations? Amos 9: 7 has the answer:\\"Are you not like the Ethiopians to me, O people of Israel?\\" says the LORD. \\"Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir? 8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the surface of the ground; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,\\" says the LORD. 9 \\"For lo, I will command, and shake the house of Israel among all the nations as one shakes with a sieve, but no pebble shall fall upon the earth. 10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, 'Evil shall not overtake or meet us.'The nations chosen for this comparison were not distinguished for might and prestige- countries such as Egypt and Assyria- but rather, nations which were despised and disliked. The color of the Ethiopian is black and in those days many of them were sold on the slave markets. The Philistines were the arch enemies of Israel, and the Syrians continued to be a menace to the Northern Kingdom. The God of Israel is the God of all nations, and all men's history is is His concern.On p. 46 Rabbi Heschel discloses an important concept to us about the God we meet in the Hebrew Bible: He is a God of pathos. No matter how angry he is, he is always on the side of his people and is seeking every means to show his redemption to them and restore them to Himself. His anger simply means he responds to how we act and his not without emotion or passive or uncaring. But as we speak about his anger we have to instantly mention his compassion. The two go hand in hand inseparably. All prophets felt the pathos of God even in the midst of his anger. That anger of the Lord did not express all that God felt about the people. Intense is His anger, but profound is his compassion. It is as if there were a dramatic tension in God. Rabbi Heschel puts is so beautifully when he says, God is conceived, not as the self-detached Ruler, but as the sensitive Consort to Whom deception comes and Who nevertheless goes on pleading for loyalty, uttering a longing for reunion, a passionate desire for reconciliation. Of all prophets, only Jeremiah has sensed a wider scale of personal relations, a more intense subjectivity. Hosea has given us a supreme expression of the vision of the subjective God so typical for prophetic awareness (please read Hosea chapter 11: 8-9). On p. 83, Rabbi Heschel presents with a beautiful concept that didn't cross my mind before. The prophets were moved by sympathy for God. Isaiah is animated by a sense of dread and the awareness of the transcendent mystery and exclusiveness of God and only secondarily by a sense of intimacy, sympathy, and involvement in the divine situation. Isaiah's sympathy for God comes to expression in a parable describing the crisis in the relationship between God and Israel(Isaiah 5: 1- 7):Let me sing for my beloveda love song concerning his vineyard:My beloved had a vineyardon a very fertile hill.Here Isaiah knows how his beloved feels. He sings about it. He feels the pain of his beloved. He is fully sympathetic. He is telling the people, Look at how the Lord feels, see where He is, see what you did and how that is making him feel. Feel for him. What intimacy!"},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"This book is very intense and detailed. It takes complete concentration to stay with the author.

He identifies their major trait as a profound sensitivity to evil. This means complete intolerance to injustice and indifference, often expressed in harsh language. The soul of the prophet resonated to a frequency that heard the cry of the afflicted. He protested vehemently, driven by compassion.In addition, the prophets fiercely repudiated mankind's subservience to might. They held up the moral law in the place of force. This was rare for their time - a view of violence as obscene and an insistence on sympathy and care for the weak. The theme that might is not right is inherent in their message. Unlike the lofty metaphysicians they focused on the everyday, the way people treat one another.Heschel looks at individual prophets like Amos, who in his concern for Israel's neighbors showed that God cared for all people. Hosea proclaimed that Israel is God's consort, the first Isaiah warned against foreign alliances while denouncing obstinacy and pride, while Micah distilled the essence of true worship: do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with the Divine.Gentle by nature, Jeremiah's anguish becomes clear as he had to convey messages of anger and suffering. The first Isaiah and Habbakuk spoke of ultimate redemption through an outpouring of the Spirit whilst the second Isaiah emphasized God's eternal love for Israel, His concern for all mankind and the concept of Israel as a light to the nations.The author shows that the prophets were torn in anguish between compassion for mankind and sympathy for God, acting as advocate for the one to the other. They constantly intervened, imploring mercy for the people whilst warning the powerful in explosive language against their abuse of power, and admonishing the whole nation for its lack of empathy. To quote Heschel: \`The opposite of freedom is not determinism, but hardness of heart.'It emerges that judgment is never final, that the gate of repentance remains open and that there is sorrow in the anger of the Lord. History is where justice suffers defeat but the prophets predicted future peace and salvation. Over and over they emphasized that kindness took precedence over wisdom, wealth or might. More than strict justice only, righteousness encompasses loving concern. The prophets proclaimed the divine pathos, revealing that the great judge is our Father too.This captivating and completely unique work succeeds in making many things clear, on both a mental and emotional level. Written in graceful prose, the concepts are easy to understand while Heschel's words speak to the heart. The Prophets is one of the most moving and comforting books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Prophets","review":"This Book was sold as New. This book came as VERY USED.

Merrily has started having informal evensong services and unexpectedly, one of the attendees is cured of a fatal tumor. Merrily isn't ready to accept this sudden sign of the Lord's blessing at face value, but her congregation does. Now she must deal with her and the church's mixed attitude toward healing. Which, she discovers, many think goes hand in hand with exorcism.The other piece of good/bad news is that Jane, Merrily's daughter and chief critic, has managed to get a weekend job as waitress and general assistant at a struggling new inn that is trying to use its tenuous connection to Arthur Conan Doyle and the hound of the Baskervilles to build a clientele. All of this on the forbidding border with Wales where, as we are often reminded, long memories and getting even is a way of life. The legends of the area include a number of characters almost as grim as their remaining heirs. Throw in mysterious black dogs and bulls, a fair amount of inherited insanity, s&eacute;ances, and film crews and you have the perfect environment for trouble.

Rickman is one of the few writers who seem to be able to bring the supernatural into a mystery story without destroying the overall effect.For all the darkness of the themes, The Prayer of the Night Shepherd is much lighter in tone than the past few volumes. Not for lack of horrible events but because Jane's self confidence and Lol's gentle wisdom balance Merrily's introspectiveness perfectly. The inner story that develops around them keeps some of the dark insanity around them at bay. I found myself enjoying the break, as well as all the bits of Sherlockiana and bleak border history. For all that this is volume 7, it stands pretty well on its own. I've managed to read this series completely out of order and don't feel I missed anything but an occasional bit of context."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"Phil Rickman is one of my favorite authors. His West Country mysteries, always with a generous sprinkle of English history, Celtic mysticism and superstition, never fail to captivate. Prayer is no exception. The Reverend Merrily Watkins is a winningly human sort of priest, with a neo-pagan daughter and a former rock star boyfriend. Supporting characters are equally well-drawn. While Rickman's plot this time round is quite complex, he moves it along at a fast pace, dropping clues to the reader if the reader's sharp enough to catch them. The surprises don't end till the very last page. If you think evil is an abstract concept, read one of Rickman's books."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"Phil Rickman's latest novel, The Prayer of the Night Shepherd, has it all -- the historical legend of Black Vaughn and the Black Dog, the literary legend of Conan Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles, the Rev. Merrily Watkins, the local \\"deliverance minister\\" (read \\"exorcist\\")whose work is fast becoming legend in the village of Ledwardine -- as well as a number of local murders, past and present, that are very real indeed. The result is a psychological thriller and supernatural whodunnit, artfully anchored in the culture and landscape of the Welsh border.Merrily and her 17 year-old daughter, Jane, share center stage in Rickman's latest effort. Jane, now an \\"independent working woman on the Border,\\" has just taken her first \\"real job,\\" working weekends at a possibly haunted hotel owned by Ben and Amber Foley, a couple \\"from Off\\". Ben, a one-time TV producer, and Antony Largo, a Scottish film-maker, enlist Jane and take advantage of her enthusiam to help them with a project -- recording a seance to be held at the Foley's hotel. However, during the filming, Jane discovers that her co-workers and the guests at Stanner Hall are not what -- or who-- she was lead to believe.Back at the Vicarage, Merrily has reluctantly agreed to use her newly-emerging healing ability to help the rather unpleasant nephew of a parishioner become free of the anxiety-induced asthma that has plagued him since childhood and the tragic death of his young cousin. She must also play the good shepherd trying to save a young sheep rancher bent on suicide, having found himself caught in a dangerous game of fox and hound with a local landowner and his hired thugs.Rickman once again works his literary magic, blending disparate themes with a diverse cast of richly-written characters. The result is a taut narrative fusion of the supernatural and detective genres, what Rickman calls \\"a spiritual procedural,\\" and he makes this story all the more intriguing with what is becoming another hallmark of the Merrily Watkins series: the intricate lacing of fiction with fact. Whether you're already a fan of the Rev. Watkins or a first-time reader, you won't be disappointed with Phil Rickman's latest offering."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"Rickman's sixth Merrily Watkins is a huge improvement over the past couple of efforts. With its snowbound denoument it redraws the Rickman reader back into a chilling novel that makes reading this novel at night not something to do easily. Rickman, over the last few novels - essentially the Merrily series - has moved from supernatural to crime thrillers with a supernatural edge and whilst he is making a grand attempt at creating what might be a new genre, it's not quite as good as his purer supernatural efforts.In this latest, Jane has a greater starring role as she moves into womanhood - to Merrily's reluctance - by taking a weekend job up at Stanner Hall near Kington. Jane is working as a kitchen maid for Ben Foley and his wife, Amber (who is acting as the chef) who have resurrected Stanner Hall as a hotel. Dead keen to get the place established Ben is eager to prove the link that the plotline for the Conan Doyle story, Hound of the Baskervilles, was actually based on events initiated by the Chancer family several centuries back and not based on Devonshire links. Inevitably the theory is holding no water with the firmly established Baker League, but is with the White, a spiritual group keen to adhere to the spiritualism that dominates much of Doyle's later life.Two plots lines run (though they must inevitably merge) - the first that of Stanner Hall and the local magistrate, Sebastian Dacre JP. The latter has hired some locals to hunt down a huge black dog he feels is savaging his flock which has its home on the farm of Jeremy Berrows (whose girlfriend, Natalie is also the Stanner Hall hotel manager). This enables our ever-friendly Gomer Parry and Danny to get involved in a few fights whilst Jane runs around trying to make sense of the seances that are now being held at Stanner Hall. The other plot line has our erstwhile self-doubting Deliverance Minister trying to stop her new Sunday service turning into a miracle parlour. She focuses on one Dexter Harris (unwitting culprit in a joyriding tragedy when he was a child) whose boorish character overshadows a greater truth. Unwittingly herself, Merrily finds herself the target for two groups to perform an exorcism whilst in the background a hereditary insanity wreaks revenge on the Kington farmers.The lengthy denouement brings the usual cast of characters of Jane, Lol, Gomer, Merrily, DI Bliss et al together during a snow-bound night at Stanner Hall after Dacre is found dead and the child murderess, Brigid Parsons, claims guilt and a desire to confess all to Merrily. As deception becomes clear and Rickman unravels the family histories and personal links amongst our protagonists it all begins to make a painful sense as he expertly weaves stark relationships in with a spritism that brings Merrily together with all for an exorcism before the all too-human culprit is found.There is no doubt that Rickman is a fine author and he expertly crafts crime thrillers that have that touch of chilling supernatural fear, creating an ambience that the reader can easily visualise and be drawn in to. My only problem is that Rickman's authorship began as pure supernatural thrillers and his legion of fans for that reason will find themselves with a creeping disappointment as the Watkins series becomes more and more of a crime thriller with a meagre touch of the supernatural. In fact, if it ended up on ITV shortly it wouldn't be a surprise. So, as brilliant as ever and Rickman demonstrates yet again the skills of an author at the peak of his powers, but, for this reader at least, I'd like more of the supernatural and less of the crime...."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"Anyone who has never read the haunting, facinating, imaginative and meticulously researched novels of British West Country author Phil Rickman is in for an enormous treat.Set in a decrepit but captivating old hotel with a dark history on the Welsh/English border, and taking place over the Christmas holiday season of snow and ice and wuthering winds, the story deals with modern murder and ancient devilry, from a mysterious, beautiful woman with a violent past living under an alias, to a machiavellian medaeval lord who haunts a local, historic church alternately in the form of a bull or a smouldering black hellhound, to a sexually predatory Victorian dominatrix with a passion for fox hunting and youthful male conquests, and a documentary film maker with a group of scholars who are convinced that Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic Hound of the Baskervilles was conceived not in Devon, but in this part of the world, all make up a twisting, anxiety-producing tale full of suspense and surprises that leaves the reader with as many provocative querries as answers--and makes you want more of Rickman's riveting yarns, and with his enduring Merrily Watkins series, as well as his other, uniquely connected novels, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"This is the first novel I've read by Phil Rickman and I am gleeful to know there are scores of novels out there by him that I get to stick my nose into.Since I haven't read any other Merrily Watkin's novels yet, I can say that 'Prayer of the Night Shepherd,' can be read and enjoyed as a stand alone novel, as I am sure all of the series' novels can. The important thing is that you read them - if you like storms, mystery, legends, ghosts, and tales shrouded in mystery, then this is a book for you!The borderland between England and Wales is steeped in legends, hauntings and old lore. Lonely rural areas can be stressful for folks who've ran the farm as their father's worked on them for decades before. Rock formations and old lodgings have strange powerful energies that can be good or bad and Merrily Watkins, Angelican Reverend of Ledwardine, is there to sort it all out.In the cold, stormy atmosphere of the Welsh countryside, Stanner Hall Hotel risks going under, unless it's new owners can actually prove that Arthur Conan Doyle based, \\"The Hounds of Baskerville,\\" on the legend of the demon dog of Hergest Court, after he stayed in Stanner Hall instead of where present credit is given. Merrily's 17 year old daughter, Jane, is enjoying her first job as helper at Stanner Hall and her mother, the Reverend would be shocked if she knew what the residents were up to. Even Jane gets a bit jittery when she realizes the truth. And Stanner Hall is steeped in mystery and hauntings based on it's previous questionable residents, who, by chance have offspring wandering about who are less then wholesome.Merrily has her hands full as it is with her recent healing of a local girl believed to have been healed by prayer at the new casual Sunday Evensong gathering as other's bring her a hard case to be healed by the bewildered, reluctant Reverend who only meant Evensong to bring in more folks to the church.There are mulitple story lines and the local characters are endearing in 'The Prayer for the Night Sherpard' as they deal with old legends, local hauntings, storms and mysteries and murders.Based on what I've read in this book, I have ordered books by this auther under the name Will Kingdom, and other Merrily books as well as his stand alone books such as Curfew and Crybbe. I will report more on them later. This book, as the wind starts blowing and the temperature drops - hot tea and a cosy place to read is in order."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"Stories of phantom black dogs abound in Britain.

The characters are evolving with each book and I am really beginning to care what happens to them."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"After taking a small break from this series, when I picked up this sixth weighty volume, I almost prolonged the break. I have a hard cover copy, and it really isn't conducive to lugging it around, but once I started reading it, I immediately was sucked back into Merrily's life. This may not be a flashy series, with non-stop action, but the characters are so realistic and the plots are so meticulously revealed that it's hard not to be engulfed in the series. Even after a break, it's like catching up with an old friend - one that you hadn't realized just how much you had missed until you were chatting away like it had been only yesterday that you had last seen one another. There is just something so lifelike about the series - even with its supernatural elements.This time Sir Arthur Conan Doyle plays a role - and those fans ofThe Hound of the Baskervilles (Sherlock Holmes Vol. 5)will particularly enjoy this installment. It was a very interesting addition!"},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"The Prayer of the Night Shepherd is the sixth entry in the Merrily Watkins series. As is the case with any novel based on a set of recurring characters, this could either be a cause for celebration or a cookie-cutter rehash of previous novels. For some authors, this would be just another paint-by-the-numbers exercise that would build on previous successes but fail to break new ground. Thankfully, this isn't the case with Rickman and his most recent work. He gives faithful readers all of the suspense and supernatural intrigue they've come to love while throwing a fresh slant on the story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles.Like so many of Rickman's novels, this one is set on the mysterious Welsh border. In particular, it is set in a Victorian hotel that is rumored to be the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles. The cast of characters who live and operate at that hotel are equally as dark and enigmatic as the surrounding countryside and the legends which thrive there. In fact, most of the characters in this book aren't what they seem at first glance. Beware, there are skeletons in every closet, and Rickman examines those old bones in detail.Chief among those intrigued by the legend of The Hound is the hotel's owner, Ben Foley. Ben is a washed-up television producer who buys the Stanner Hall Hotel in order to start a new life with his wife Amber who incidentally serves as the hotel's cook. Thought to be drifters who were just passing through, Natalie Craven and her daughter, Clancy, find positions at the hotel as well while taking up residence with the quiet brooding farmer, Jeremy Berrows who lives at a nearby farm called The Nant. Rounding out the staff at the hotel is Jane Watkins, daughter of Merrily Watkins who happens to be the Deliverance Consultant for the Diocese of Hereford.For those familiar with the previous Merrily Watkins novels, Jane plays a larger role in this novel than she has in previous Merrily novels. For those of us who have come to love her acerbic wit and dry sarcasm, this is a welcome development. Rickman skillfully uses Jane and her curiosity in the pagan lifestyle as a counterpoint to Merrily's stance as an Anglican priest. What results is an interesting twist of irony between mother and daughter that runs throughout the novel as Jane becomes involved with The White Company, a group of spiritualists whose beliefs are in direct contradiction to everything that Merrily stands for as an Anglican priest. Lol Robinson, Gomer Parry, and Frannie Bliss invariably show up in the narrative as well, lending familiarity and dark humor to an unfamiliar and bleak set of circumstances.As is the case with most of Rickman's novels, there are usually several storylines going on simultaneously, and this book is no exception. Foremost, a group of spiritualists called The White Company attempts to summon Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's spirit at the hotel where Jane is working while a documentary maker named Antony Largo plans to capture it all on tape. Meanwhile, Merrily finds herself in a bit of a dilemma when her parishioners start to view her as a sort of miracle worker, bombarding her with requests for divine healing. This becomes tricky and even dangerous when she is asked to heal the nephew of one of her parishioners only to find out that there is much more to him than meets the eye. Then there is the dilemma of Jeremy Berrows, a local farmer who is constantly being intimidated and indirectly threatened by Sebbie Dacre, a regional landowner who has hired a group of hunters to track down and kill a large black dog that has been sighted on Jeremy's land. Also \\"living\\" at the hotel is the supposed ghost of Hattie Chancery, previous owner of Stanner Hall who committed suicide in one of its rooms after bashing her husband's head in.Without recounting too much of the story and spoiling what turns out to be several well-kept secrets involving character lineage and motive, let it suffice to say there are enough twists and turns to keep readers guessing. Rickman deftly weaves several subplots into a cohesive story without losing the atmosphere that has become one of his trademarks. The Prayer of the Night Shepherd has murder, legends involving an ancestral evil that is passed down from generation to generation, attempted suicide, a famous convicted killer who has changed identities and walks about the hotel unrecognized, and sightings of an ominous black dog that foreshadows death.The Prayer of the Night Shepherd is every bit as good as the other books in the Merrily Watkins series. It is also an ideal place to start for the uninitiated as it doesn't draw too heavily on the history of the characters or any of the events that took place in previous books. If you're a Merrily Watkins fan, a fan of the Sherlock Holmes series, an avid reader of mysteries, or just love a well-crafted tale full of paranormal suspense, this is the book for you. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Prayer Of The Night Shepherd","review":"I love Phil Rickman and his Reverend Merrily Watkins series, and this is probably one of the best \\"caught in a snowstorm\\" stories that I've ever read. The action takes place very close to Christmas in Merrily's village (Ledwardine) and in a gothic castle located right on the English and Welsh border. The area itself is full of mystery, and the old house has many of its own secrets that it keeps while it sits brooding in amongst the hills. Jane, Merrily's daughter, is working weekends up at this old house since it is now a hotel, and she stumbles on a real hornet's nest of intrigue and bad karma. Ancient secrets are about to be ripped open and this unleashes an evil that seems to come from the soil itself. Merrily is called in to do an excorcism to help free the house from its brooding and malignant prescence, and while she and Jane are there a murder occurs.

Kyle is much more substantial and well-rounded in Winnick's hands, a most welcome improvement. On the negative side, this is Winnick's first superhero work, and it shows; the pace, structure, and overall execution are awkward, giving the narrative an uneven feel. That having been said, I'll mention that Winnick's work on the title since has dramatically improved; he seemed to really hit his stride a few issues after those collected here.

It is the driest and most boring history book that I have ever read in my life. The entire thing is presented as a simple collection of facts and the author hardly gives you any insight into what the major characters were really like (sometimes you get a little glimpse in the footnotes). I bought this book after seeing all the good reviews it had gotten, but I have trouble focusing on reading for more than 10 minutes because I feel like I'm wasting my time reading this tedious amassment of factual evidence."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"...The part that I found interesting that I didn't get in the other books was the Story of E.O.Lawerence. In most of the other books I have read on the subject you just hear about Lawerence as the great man and hear about his Calutrons at Oak Ridge. This book told more of his story and the type of person he was.Although that was interesting to me over all I found this book lacking in a lot of areas. One was the fact that he didn't talk more about the tests at Livermore and Los Alamos. It seemed to be several stories that where not tied together well because it would jump from espionage to bomb building to jealousy between the three.I believe the book talked about the problems but not really the reasons. If Lawrence and Oppenheimer were such good friends at first why did Lawrence band his brother Frank from Berkley because he told a lie it just didn't seem to make sense and I thought there should have been more of an explanation.The book played Teller off in a more kinder light than I have seen in other books. It also seem to show that Oppenheimer was not an agent but someone who thought that nuclear energy had to be controlled and band because he thought the general public couldn't handle it. This showed especially when it talks about him crumpling the model of Rickover's sub.Another thing with this book is that you should keep a dictionary with you while reading this book unless you know the meaning of words like antithetical, proselytize and anathema. I don't mind this because I like to increase my vocabulary I just thought you should know.The book, to use one of the author's favorite words is an imbroglio, a confused mass.I got out of it what I wanted that some of the other books on the subject did not have.

The Brotherhood of the Bomb is one such book. I've read a fair share of Manhattan Project/Oppenheimer books. Brotherhood does a great job of widening the focus and putting three men (Oppenheimer, Lawrence and Teller) in view, instead of just one. Much of the Oppenheimer material was familiar to me from American Prometheus or The Making of the Atomic Bomb (both excellent), but this book put those events in the context of the ongoing (and often fractious) relationships between these three men.

But after slogging through the first 100 pages, I had to see what other reviewers may have said on Amazon. I see that a few agree with me. The topic is one of the most amazing of our time, but the writing is horribly academic, boring, and poor. Gregg Herken's writing style (if one can even call it that) is similar to a law review article, where facts are piled up high, references are many, but any style and creativity is buried. In this book, it's does not exist. I would not recommend this to other to read."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"Thunderous clouds, brilliant purple and multicolor radioactive plumes jettisoning what were once precious sought after kilograms of chemistry's beyond bizzare materials. Such is the ballad that was played one mid-July morning, 1945, at Trinity Test Site, some 20 miles east south east of San Antonio, NM, after years of ingenius experimental and theoretical work, computation, sweating, rivalry, and finally utterly destructive convergeancey into one of modern science's most awe inspiring gadgets. 'The gadget' as it would come to be called, set off much else than meagerly its own wired and machined self - in the process of self-detonation, the world's first atom bomb brought about, unexpectedly and unforseen, a world's first feat, an end to a world conflict, - Pacific front - a murky arms race with juxtaposed cold war, and, in the end one of mankinds most thrilling achievements. Insofar as today's youth can but arbitrarily surmount such things as 'shock waves' or 'nonlinear implosionary ballistics dynamics,' fresh-faced prodigys, physics phenoms, and other human wonder-brains pulled off not only calculations of destiny, but together made Los Alamos into the 'biggest collection of eggheads ever assembled.' The conflict-laden tale of Robert Oppenheimer (head of Project Manhatten, razor-sharp intellect, lead bomb scientist), Ernest Lawrence (brilliant, charismatic, enthusiastic, well-liked Rad Lad originator and Nobel Laureate for his cyclotron radiation experiments), and 'the only monomaniac to suffer from multiple manias, Beethoven piano playing in nothing but fortissimo, Hungarian figurehead, H-bomb creator (sort of)' Edward Teller. Three characters starkly in contrast to each other's standout, signature diacritics: Oppenheimer as excessively learned linguist and rapid assimilator; Lawrence as driven lab leader with a taste for breaking particle accelerator barriers; Teller as European half-scientist, half-artist idea maker. What was to be born in each of these men's dreams - however much in contrast those drifting epiphanies may have been - manifested themselves first on paper as drawing or formulae, then as physical device or working instrument. Brotherhood of the Bomb is indeed a story of the tangled correspondances and relationships forged and endured throughout the war, but it is more than that. It delves deep into personal convictions, dilemmas, creativity, mystifying outcomes of the scientific method and journey, and controversial until-now-unspoken tid bits from an era of Top Secrecy. Remembering such times is difficult to say the very least even for the men, and women, directly involved. This is perhaps so because the people at the fore, engrossed in whatever field of research, were themselves in every way imaginable enigmas - contradictions in motion in several instances. Loyalties would become circumspect, motives would held under microscope, but inevitably the real impact of a product of incomprehensible physics is to be realized most dismayingly. Costs and benefits aside, a history of an odyssey only meant for storybooks is casually uncovered via the recorded conversations and testimonies of some of America's cleverest progenitors of atomic energy and its later fabrications (i.e. Three Mile Island incident frenzy). If anything, the clueless sees an open door into the realm of nuclear technology's immemorial upbringing(s) and drama(s). Even six decades later, the actual underpinnings of the bomb are little understood except in major institutions and classified memos/docs. This title's innards unearth a memoir so shockingly abstract, it has to be reread repeatedly in order to grasp any certain feel for what occured, what prompted its occurence, and what eventuated beyond zero hour in New Mexicos vaguely populated regions - similar to spotting a haystack enveloping a needle, you pick the size.In a land of enchantment, one may yet find green-hued intense-heat-fused silicates of that moment in history when thermodynamicist, hydrodynamicisit, theoretist in general all let out a gargantuan 'Yahoo!' predating Google's punching bag companion of a search engine.Echoes no longer may be detected in now and then restricted spaces, but on that morning just following a timely (to them painstakingly unwelcomed) foreshadowing thunderstorm of nature's ever present wrath, the genie was unleashed...never to be resealed. Loose for purposes unknown and grandiose. Rustically elegant though the desert may be, a flash of a thousand suns was never intentionally in store, or until it became apparent by sight and sound... as well as indetectible rays of near cosmic intensity and proportion.This book is so well written I don't dare try to emulate or mimic its prose. Intimate details of the three protagonists nearest the atom bomb's core are intriguingly lurid, stunning in places, still somehow comforting to those who care about science and its indisputable power and constant legacy. One physicist I would like to have seen mentioned more is John Von Neumann, who essentially single-handedly - by rigorously furthering the conceptual drafts of Neddermeyer through mathematical construct and logical proof - theorized implosion, amongst a vast array of other topics and subjects only a rare but true polymath could conjure (Claude Shannon is another). Without Von Neumann there is no Super, no computer architecture, no game theory, no quantum mechanics (or at least its 'Group Theory' aspects) and no non-fictional inspiration for generations succeeding.Also, of due notoriety is the background and determined leadership of General Leslie R. Groves - lead construction planner of the Pentagon and Project Manhatten organizer possessing immense profundity of temperance and sensibilty."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"The overwhelming egos which worked together on the bomb and became a part of the fallout after Hiroshima and Nagasaki."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"I'm only a few chapters into the book at the moment.

Excellent job!"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"In the world of historians, Daniel J. Boorstin stands head and shoulders above all lesser writers in that nonfiction genre, much as Loren Eiseley and, to a lesser extent, Stephen Jay Gould, reign supreme as literary craftsmen in the sciences. This thought was inescapable to me as I read yet another in a prolix series of books about the historic import of scientists. Since the two disciplines- science and history- often intertwine when reading books about the Manhattan Project comparisons of the writers of such books with the aforementioned trinity is inevitable, as well as very productive in the art of criticism. Thus, when I read the 2002 book, Brotherhood Of The Bomb, by Gregg Herken- an atomic bomb junky whose prior works (such as The Winning Weapons: The Atomic Bomb In The Cold War) were soaked in the topic, I had to groan, for Herken has absolutely no grasp of what makes for compelling nor imaginative writing.When one reads the classics of Boorstin- such as The Discoverers, The Creators, or The Americans, one is engrossed by his novelistic techniques which can make the most well known tales of historical figures and cast them in a patina of freshness. When one reads the essays of Eiseley, gathered in classics like The Night Country or The Immense Journey, one is blown away by the elegant poesy and profundity of his sentences. When one reads the essays of Gould- from books like The Mismeasure Of Man or Bully For Brontosaurus, one is dazzled by his ability to thread together the most seemingly disparate things into a coherent idea. But, in Brotherhood Of The Bomb one is merely bored to nihility by Herken's turgidity and utter lack of insight into his subject matter, as well as the pointless epigraphs for the book's five parts....Herken too often veers from the making of the bomb- the only reason anyone would care of these three intellectual bores, to try to exculpate Oppenheimer, so that the first atomic test is written of only in a few pages. This is like writing of Newton's theory of gravity and focusing on the worm in the legendary apple that was to fall onto the scientist's head. Yet, this is the state most writing- fictive or not, has devolved to in this day and age. The book won many literary awards upon its release, and Herken himself was awarded a hefty MacArthur Genius Grant to write the book. Yet nothing speaks more highly of the absolute lack of depth and insight the book displays than how Herken ends it, by reciting the well known dueling apothegms of Oppenheimer and Teller, where the former declares that \`Physicists have known sin,' only to have his rival retort, \`I would say that physicists have known power.'Such summative words show that Herken, far from being an objective researcher, was more a kid in a- groan, please- candy shop, who tossed off this banal book to fulfill a childish obsession. There are no larger ideas nor any penetrating revelations that only this book dared to print. Perhaps such needless space consumption is ok as fodder for the Lowest Common Denominator blogs that choke the internet, but valuable publishing resources should not be wasted on such pap. If you agree, then click over to Herken's book's website Brotherhood Of The Bomb, or shoot him and email at gherken@brotherhoodofthebomb.com, and let him know that the waste of pulp is also a sin that his hero, Oppenheimer, would disavow, and to stay cyber. Do not do it for me, do it for Boorstin, Eiseley, and Gould. Better yet, do it for yourself....or the trees."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"Gregg Herken's Brotherhood of the Bomb manages to overcome the most common obstacle with history books--it makes the subjects and the events come alive. Herken had access to The Smithsonian Archieves as well as interviews with the primary sources involved in the creation of the bomb. The book is a fair balanced account of the difficult personalities and politics that went into the creation of the first nuclear bomb and the later more powerful \\"super\\". Only two other books has been this impressive (both by Richard Rhodes)and exhaustive. Herken's book has the advantage of additional resources.The personalities and egos of Oppenheimer, Teller and Lawrence contributed to the rise and downfall of each man. Oppenheimer's eventual ethical objections to the development of the super came as much from his personal beliefs as it did his distaste for Teller's ideas. Teller became a hawk regarding nuclear policy and, ultimately, his opinions on Oppenheimer contributed to his loss of his security clearence. Lawrence was as driven as both men and largely apolitical until politics and science intersected.Herken's book is a fascinating portrait of the players and time that helped shape the modern world."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"Herken has written a wonderful account of the United States's programs to develop an atomic bomb during World War II and to build an H-bomb during the 1950s. But beyond chronicling scientific and technological developments, the book explores the world of American politics and government and how it was influencing the physics side of things. More importantly to the work's argument, however, Herken also delves into the scientists personal lives--their friendships, their hobbies, their activities. To that end, he focuses on three:--Ernest Orlando Lawrence, the driven, imperious, South Dakotan who directed the Rad(iation) Lab at Berkeley and created--ruled, some would say--a \\"cyclotron republic\\" there--Edward Teller, the temperamental Hungarian emigre who fled to the United States from Communists in his native land and from Nazis in Germany, and who, to the exclusion of almost everything else, pursued the H-bomb at Los Alamos and then at Livermore (an interesting anecdote describes how, at the Trinity test, he stunned his companions by putting on suntan lotion, gloves, and welder's glasses)--J. Robert \\"Oppie\\" Oppenheimer (according to Herken, the \\"J\\" stands for nothing; other sources have it as \\"Julius\\"), the introspective director of the Manhattan Project with an affinity for Eastern religions and leftist, even Communist, causesThese three figure prominently in the tale which begins at Berkeley in the 1930s, where the great physicists of the day began to coalesce. World War II took most of them to Los Alamos in some way or another, although Lawrence's work was mostly at the Rad Lab developing ways of enriching uranium. By the end of the war, splits were beginning to appear as the scientists became more aware of the political and moral implications of their work. While Oppenheimer became something of a celebrity in the nation at large and served as an advisor to a handful of government commissions and committees, Lawrence fervently lobbied for government funding for bigger and faster cyclotrons, and Teller ever more energetically pursued his Super.Oppenheimer, who had been loosely affiliated with the Communist Party in the late 1930s, had been under FBI scrutiny--including wiretaps of his phone--ever since he became director at Los Alamos and gained a security clearance then only at Leslie Groves' insistence. In the mid-1950s, as the penetration of the bomb project came to light, and in the wake of the McCarthy hearings, and after Oppenheimer had voiced his opposition to the Super, the physicist's political leanings began to concern government officials. Hearings were held, which included somewhat ambiguous though negative testimony from Teller, and Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked.Of course, this is just the briefest of summaries. Other books, notably and admirably Rhodes', have detailed both bomb programs, but Herken's adds depth to the stories by focusing on the personal relationships between the scientists and demonstrating how they impacted events. Loyalty was important. But loyalty to what? Friends? Family? Science? The government? Politics? Ideology? Humanity? More often that not, it was a combination--\\"tangled loyalties,\\" as Herken calls it. And the end result was often ill will or resentment; disagreements over the ends of science often boiled over into broken friendships, or into political conflict.These men loom large in modern history. They were giants of nuclear physics as well as of their time. But they were human, too--flawed giants. \\"Physicists have known sin,\\" said Robert Oppenheimer. In response, some years later, Edward Teller wrote, \\"Physicists have known power.\\" No two statements better capture the status of physics (and physicists) in the world--and the differences separating these two men."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"This is a wonderful book about one of the most controversial developments of the last century: the development of the atomic and then hydrogen bombs. At the core of the book are the three scientists - Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller - who had the greatest impact, both from the technical problems they confronted and from the political points of view they advocated. Though a bit rarified in terms of general interest as it focuses on science advisors, this for me was a fascinating recounting of the decisions that led to the arms race and eventually cost $5.5 trillion and produced 120,000 nuclear weapons. It also evokes with great eloquence the domestic repercussions of the cold war and paranoia of the 1950s.Herken writes well, though at times his style was strange for me. For example, one person evaluated a speech with a \\"gimlet eye.\\" (I had to look that up.) Nonetheless, Herken's writing is dramatic and fast paced, far far better than I would normally expect from an American academic.Recommended with enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"\\"Brotherhood of the Bomb\\" is very good for its first hundred pages as it details the early careers of physicists Ernest Lawrence, Robert Oppenheimer, and Edward Teller. Thereafter, the book gets a little too fact-laden and turgid, but it is still a worthwhile book to make your way through. The author strives for, and mostly achieves, an objective account of the scientific and political controversies surrounding Robert Oppenheimer.The book is good in that it gives recognition to Lawrence as a pioneering atomic energy physicist and assigns only secondary roles to Oppenheimer and Teller in the early part of the book. The charismatic Oppenheimer, however, received the assignment of leading the team that built the first atomic bomb -- although General Leslie Groves, decidely uncharismatic, was really the man who managed the multi-faceted project and deserves at least equal credit with the scientists. Teller, also decidely uncharismatic, later managed the hydrogen bomb project and was a prominent voice in the scientific community until the 1980s.The fascination of all the science is enhanced by Oppie's politics and the eventual denial of a security clearance for him to work for the U.S. government. The author describes Oppie's many leftist and Communist friends and contacts -- as investigated by the FBI and military security -- in great detail. In most accounts, Teller is the dastardly villain who declines to recommend Oppie for a renewal of his security clearance -- and Oppie forever after will be a hero to those who see this as a vast injustice. I hardly think it was all that big a deal. Oppie didn't go to jail, he didn't lose his job, he wasn't disgraced in the scientific community -- if anything his reputation and fame were enhanced. All that happened to Oppie was that he was denied the opportunity to work on bigger and better bombs within the US government.Teller, in one divergent view, was the man of conscience who expressed his view and will be forever punished for it. While I would be surprised to learn that Oppie was a spy, rational people could certainly believe that he was a potential security threat; many of his closest associates and relatives were Communists and his past political behavior had been reckless for a man entrusted with the most sensitive secrets of the U.S. government. As the old saw goes, you are judged by the company you keep -- and nobody in his right mind would have shared atomic secrets with many of Oppie's friends. (The Teller vs Oppenheimer controversy will undoubtedly continue through the ages.)If you like this book, you might also look at Richard Rhodes' two monumental volumes on the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"I've always found the subject of America's quest to build the atomic bomb to be one of history's most fascinating subjects. There are few things that have changed the course of world events more than the Allied victory in WWII and the onset of the nuclear age.A number of years ago, I had the pleasure of visiting Los Alamos, New Mexico, and spent half a day at the museum near the lab that detailed the development of the bomb.That's why I was excited to see this new book about Lawrence, Teller and Oppenheimer and quickly sat down to read it. Now that I've finished it, I don't think I know much more about what happened than I did before picking up the book.Sure, there are some fascinating passages about the scientists and their relationships with one another, but there is very little actual information on what happened. Part of the problem is that the book is so clumsily written that it is too hard to follow. The writer alternates between writing about the development of the bomb and writing about quest to prove Oppenheimer's loyalty and subequently fails to include enough substance on either subject. To give you an idea, the actual detonation of the first atomic bomb in White Sands is given only a few pages. Subsequent tests are barely mentioned at all.Thankfully, the writer covers the issue of Soviet espionage and the questionable behavior of the Oppenheimer brothers but even that discussion seems to have the proper context.I'll give it two stars because of my interest in the subject matter but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"In this well written book that draws on recently declassified US and Soviet sources, Herken draw a picture of the transition from research to high stakes nuclear policy. He uses the lives of three key physicists, Lawrence, Oppenheimer and Teller, to explore the complex issues of applying the new knowledge about atomic power to first creating an atomic bomb, and later to the intense debate about whether a hydrogen bomb should be created.In choosing three scientists with very different temperaments, Herken describes not only the chronology of events from the mid 30's to the 60's, but can look at the fascinating intersection of how personal experiences contribute to the shape of history.I was personally fascinated by Oppenheimer, who was affiliated with left wing and Communist organizations in the 30's, but did a stellar job of driving the research that led to the atomic bomb. The book describes how various government agencies had him and his colleagues under surveillance throughout the war, and into the 50's. I found this fascinating. Far more repulsive was how innuendo and carefully excerpted materials were used to paint him as a possible spy during the 50's Communist witch hunts.For me, Oppenheimer's was the saddest story; using his reluctance to create the H-bomb as \\"proof\\" that he was a Soviet sympathizer is one of the dark moments of American history. The story of a man with a conscience about the consequences of his actions, against a backdrop of huge pressures to compete against the Soviet arms program, is the stuff of tragedy.The portraits of the scientists are well drawn, and their differing motivations become clearer as they become older.You don't need to be a physicist yourself to read this... The science is explained succinctly, with enough detail to be satisfying to the lay person. It might be slightly disappointing to someone deeply familiar with physics.The focus is on how personality and politics shaped one of the most critical policies of the second half of the twentieth century: the American nuclear policy."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"This is the story of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb and the brotherhood of men whose genius created the bomb.

The book is very informative and interesting about the development of \\"the Bomb\\", and beyond. The book goes into vast detail about Ernest Lawrence, Robert Oppenheimer, and Edward Teller; especially Ernest Lawrence. The book starts in about 1939 with Ernest's invention of the cyclotron, and ends in the early 1960's with the Limited Test-Ban treaty. Besides talking about the relationships between the three physicists, which is very interesting, the book also talks about a lot of the small people involved in the production of the first fission weapon. What I think is cool, is the information given on Robert Oppenheimer from the FBI. The book also sends a lot of time discussing Edward Teller's interest and development of the Hydrogen Bomb. Although it does give some information about the nuclear testing we have done, it would be better if the Author discussed this more. Overall, I enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history and development of nuclear weapons."},{"Title":"Brotherhood of the Bomb : The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Edward Teller","review":"Despite a prose style I find to be rather dry (as if the author believes that responsible history must be informational in tone as well as content), Herken's story of the American nuclear weapons program's early years does succeed in giving us the key players in the drama before, during, and after Los Alamos in all their gloriously flawed humanness. Teller is seen as the uncomfortably single-minded father of the hydrogen bomb, planning and plotting that weapon even before Little Man and Fat Boy were produced, calling the atomic bomb a mere engineering project in comparison to the \\"Super.\\" Lawrence is the organizer and initiator, fostering bigger and bigger cyclotrons and recruiting more and more scientists and technicians (\\"the boys\\") for his pet project. And then there's Oppenheimer, most brilliant and egoistic of all, whose nonchalant inattention seems to have been as great a factor in his fall from grace as his political leanings in the years before the war. In the exceptional feature film that could be made from this story, the substance of this book would serve a screenwriter well. However, since Herken's prose possesses more flatness of tone than enthusiasm, it would not be wise to attempt to translate its style to film.

His writings are a treasure."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I specifically enjoy the ability of this author to make the reader to feel part of the story..The characters introduced are people we have had an experience with in our lives."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"My first J.

Good details, nice suspenseful story - Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Have you ever come across a movie that you loved in your youth and watched it again, only to find out that what you had enjoyed so much had become trite? This is what I thought of this book, so much so that I put it down (which I have done less than 10 times in my life. The narrative is stilted and maybe it is an American vs Brit thing but I also felt it was amateurish.Don't get me wrong, I have read may Archer novels and loved \\"As the Crow Flies\\" which I read several times and recommended to family. But I kept thinking about the believably and boneheadedness of the dialogue and realized I just didn't care. At All."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Really enjoyed this escapist story and recommend it, but the Kindle version is a mess. There are many typographical errors, quite a few of which interfere with understanding. A word like \\"learn\\" can be written as \\"barn\\" causing the reader to stop reading to try to figure out what the word is supposed to be as what appears is obviously wrong. This happens distractingly often and detracted from my enjoyment. A disservice to an otherwise good story."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A Matter of Honor is the first book I have read by this author. The beginning was slow, but once the story began to have alot of action, I could not put this book down. This is truly a great story. I will be reading more stories from this author."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller. Not one of his most recent stories, but it is a page turner. Set in the cold war era, it is a story that could well have taken place. Story takes you from Moscow to Geneva, to France to Great Britan and the United States. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Really enjoyed the book- Kept you guessing. You wonder what country is going to end up with the icon.Want to read one of his other books."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Easy reading as, with most of Archers works. I found the book entertaining and a nice way to spend some spare time!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's 2:47am, the last page read, and I can finally go to sleep. Great read, great suspense, and a great twist."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I like a book that is fast, compelling and with a lot of mystery - this ticks all the right boxes. Archer certainly is a good storyteller and I think this is probably his best. The book opens with Adam reading a letter, which reminded me of another great (and very funny) book I read this year, Tony Royden's dark comedy thrillerThe Dealer. They both start in similar ways, with a letter that triggers off a chain of mysterious events, but they are very different reads - both superb in different ways. A Matter Of Honor is much more of a James Bond type thriller.I really enjoyed this book. A must read!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the fourth book I've read by Jeffrey Archer. I enjoyed Kane &amp; Abel and The Prodical Daughter, and was lukewarm on The Fourth Estate. This one had an intriguing plot that kept me guessing right up to the end."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Archer's later novels seem to be more polished.

Enjoyed this book as I did so many of his other books. His stories keep you wanting to read on, hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A Matter Of Honor is another Jeffrey Archer tour de force. It is a typical Archer book in the manner that it weaves the story togeather through character development. The characters are all very interesting and it is quite a good tale that Archer tells. The best part for me is that the ending was a little bit different from what I was expecting."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There is a certain formula to a type of political spy thriller, and it goes like this. Nice, naive (usually rich and handsome) guy gets himself entangled in a major international conspiracy. Everyone, including his own Government, tries to kill him, but with luck, pluck, and some help from unlikely allies (one of whom *must* be a gorgeous woman), he survives, beats all obstacles, and saves the world.In this book, while we can see the skeleton of the formula ...those bones are magnificently covered, and what could be just another spy thriller of the type made famous (or infamous, depending on your preferences) by Robert Ludlum becomes a vibrant, unique and entirely readable spy thriller that combines action on all levels, with characters you can believe, in a setting that some readers will remember.to begin with, the main character, though nice and good looking, isn't rich. He also has a skill set that makes his actions and daring-do very believable. Sure, he learns some things as he goes, but he has the basic combat and survival skills he will need, and, right from the beginning, we know how he obtained them. In addition, though, he is a very decent and honorable person, and while he gets himself entangled in a whee of a mess, he gets out of it with as much brain power as hand to hand combat skills.The setting is the cold war era ...and, like John Le Carre, the author has a fine understanding of that particularly paranoid part of modern history, and presents it accurately and with just enough detail to make it entirely credible. All of the major factions are represented beautifully, and it is easy to just slip back in time to those days when nobody trusted anybody, and usually for very good reasons.As always, the writing is crisp and straightforward. The author has a story to tell, and the command of language to tell it with grace and finesse.It so happens that I love such books, so I tend to be critical of them. John Le Carre is my personal bench mark ...and Jeffrey Archer definitely reaches it, in this novel. In fact, while reading it, I felt as though I was enjoying the best of John Le Carre and Ian Fleming, all in one delightful package."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It has been a while since I have read a Cold War mystery / thriller, and I was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed it seeing as how the Cold War is allegedly over and we know how it ended - but then again this is Jeffrey Archer we're talking about so it was worth a try.Needless to say, I was not disappointed. In true Archer fashion, he quickly gets you into the heads of the characters - both the good and bad guys - and you can really relate to their perspective on life. Archer has finely crafted action scenes, as well as the buildup to the \\"dramatic conclusion\\" that keeps you on the edge of your seat.I was traveling a lot when I started this one, and I had to start and stop a lot of times as I just didn't have my normal amount of time to read. That wasn't a good thing, as Archer had hooked me pretty good and I kept getting impatient on wanting to get back to the tale. If you're looking for a good page-turner of a mystery, I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the first book I've read by Jeffrey Archer and I don't know if I will read another - I at least won't PAY to read another in any case. While the story was interesting enough for me to want to finish it to see exactly how it ended, I was often frustrated while reading it and came away feeling that it was unnecessarily long. There were several sections that felt to me that they did not contribute much to the story or were lengthened considerably for no real reason at all except if the author were being paid by the page. I also felt Archer tried to make the story super-complicated, almost as if taunting the reader to try to keep up with him. The only real praise I can give this work is that he enticed me to want to finish it, rather than reaching the 50 page threshold and deciding to not waste my time."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First I do think that author is very talented and I have really enjoyed of that I have read by him. This book, I enjoyed as well, though, I don't feel I can give the book a 5 as I of do judge of the authors books. I have to give this book a 3, nearly a 4. Why? Well, and I think I could be wrong, but I felt the main character was able to befriend people way to easily. In fact, way too convenient. The girl helping him, the family helping him, and a person who works for the Foreign Office using phones that may or may not secure.Okay, so this is my thought. People became this mans friend too easy. They trusted him. I thought this was off. I didn't think it was feasible. Though I must admit, he was in the a different county, where that may be more feasible. I live in the US and that just may not work. So I could be wrong. However, I also think about James Bond and in those flicks, he was able to get help of others. Things just happened for him.My other point, when our main character spoke on the phone with his best friend who was living the double live. He just demanded to have a question answered. There was no rationale for it.Other than that, I thought the book was good. In some ways it makes me think of Honor Among Thieves, though that book was written many years latter.Well, that is a enough, I don't want to bad mouth the guy. But I do think if you are like me, pretentious about things you will find a book has some big feasibility holes."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is one those kind that I would count as flawless.

The way Jeffery Archer's book is set up, creats a long begining and the reader compleatly looses interest with in the first two chapters.

If I wasn't already a Jeffry Archer fan, I would become one. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As a voracious reader seeking genuinely good writing without paying inflated e-book prices, I troll through Amazon's endless recommendations that increasingly emphasize first-time writers of unedited novels. I haven't had loads of luck doing this -- too many of these low-priced efforts are undeveloped and heavy-handed, but with Jeffrey Archer's \\"A Matter of Honor,\\" I found an author of great promise and a carefully, well-developed book with engaging, believable characters, an exciting plot, and genuinely skilful writing. Other reviewers have (correctly) noted that Archer unfortunately build in a few utterly unbelievable, clunky plot elements at the beginning, and for a few moments these absolutely ruin the sense of reality the book is trying to build, but the novel does drive ahead and recovers the reader's trust. (Any decent editor could have helped Mr. Archer avoid these obvious boners.) Soon enough, we are engaged with interesting and distinct characters that we care about. Settings and plot elements are genuinely interesting and believable, and the story is fast-paced and compelling. Archer has succeeded in bringing an exciting story to life. This is a better work than some of the recent productions of authors and teams with which it is being compared. I think this is a real find, and I'll be reading more Archer."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found the book intriging and a fun read.

Worth the read."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"You won't be disappointed in this book. It is absolutely spellbinding. Archer is his usual genius.This book was written in 1986, long before Kindles. So apparently what Hodder and Stoughton did was simply do a scan of the type. Then they emailed the digital format, utterly untouched and unread, to Amazon. And it really shows.Barely five or 10 pages go by before you notice the next typo or word substitution. These scanners are much improved but just not perfect.Most annoying are the missing page breaks. One paragraph you are in London with Adam and the very next paragraph you suddenly realize you are in Moscow with Alex. Clearly there was meant to be a couple lines separation. But it just isn't there.But, I want to know why I have to pay $7.99 -- the same price as the proofread paper version? If there are no standards for Kindle materials, there at least ought to be a discount."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Usually I like Jeffery Archer's books.

His thrillers are always terrribly exciting, but I especially enjoyed this one. It is a novel about an ordinary person, who through certain circumstances, becomes drawn into international espionage through following up on a letter received as part of his father's will. I read the entire thing in one day and evening, starting in the morning, and finishing at midnight. And you won't be able to put it down either ! !"},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Unsure why people rated this high.

Lots of cold war action and unexpected turns. As a new Kindle owner I can only hope that all the books don't look as if they were the pre-proof reader copy."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"One of the better works by Jeffrey Archer - I'm not terribly keen on the political themes that recur in some of his books, but \\"A Matter of Honour\\" is a thoroughbred thriller about a high-stakes game between international espionnage organisations.The year is 1966, and the Soviet Union stands to deal the United States a humiliating defeat. A long-forgotten codicil to the treaty by which the United States bought Alaska from Russia would allow the Soviet Union a single opportunity to recover the territory - by purchasing it back for 100 times the purchase price, or 720 million dollars, after 99 years. President Andrew Johnson could never have forseen the difficulty in which he would one day place President Lyndon Johnson - who's not at all willing to become the first American leader to preside over a reduction in the size of his nation's territoryThere's only one problem: the Soviets have lost their copy of the treaty. It's hidden an ancient Russian icon, itself locked in a Swiss safety deposit box. That icon, in turn, has just been mysteriously bequeathed to Adam Scott following the death of his father. As Adam moves to clear up questions surrounding his father's life, the Soviets dispatch Alex Romanov to retrieve the icon. Romanov is himself a very complex and dangerous character, a man whose loyalty to the regime he serves will be undermined by the very memory that he IS a Romanov. This book never slows down, and you'll never forget the scene when the safety deposit box is opened for the last time."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"AMOH is very similar to Ludlum. Filled with espionage and action. Enjoyable for an adult but I kept thinking if I was in my teens I would have thought this the best book ever. I think this is because the characters are young (and innocent)."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am definitely a Jeffrey Archer fan, but I thought this book was just ho hum. It is definitely not one of his better books, although an enjoyable read. Archer took his normal two main characters and intertwined them through the plot of the story. But in this particular book, you found that you were continually pulling for the good guy and hating the predictable bad one. At the end, you find that good always triumphs over evil, but at the cost of several good, innocent lives. And the very end is a letdown. I'm glad to see that Mr. Archer's books are much better than this particular one."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Archer's A Matter of Honor is, I think, one of the best thrillers out there, and one of my most riveting reads. I has almost everything that makes a thriller a book not to put down -- from a rich plot full of intrigues, timely revelations and breath-taking suspense; to characters that are colorful, rugged, vicious, smart and daring; to a setting that is far-reaching, complex and fascinating. The encompassing nature of this story brings to mind the story of Gavin in Triple Agent Double Cross. If you are looking for a full thriller, one that has adventure, murder, integrity, values and love, A Matter of Honor is the book to read."},{"Title":"A Matter of Honor (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Archer is a classic novelist. I'm sure some will balk at that but, for me, it's true. I've read about 6 of his works now and, each time, I'm sucked in before the end of chapter one. I thoroughly enjoy his sagas spanning the life of a particular subject or subjects and, after reading \\"Not a penny more, not a penny less\\" I was introduced to Archer's style when it came to a plot spanning a shorter period in time.I picked up A matter of Honor and found myself drawn in early in the book. Archer's writing style is very easy to follow and he never leaves you wondering where you are in the story. You always know who \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" is and where they are in space and time. I particularly enjoy the snippets of information Archer uses to color in the text. This novel involves a painting termed an \\"icon\\" that the Russians have had hanging in the Winter Palace. Unfortunately, that one is a fake and the real one was left to Capt. Adam Scott by his father who was a security guard to Air Marshal Guerring. The real one also holds a secret that the Russians and Americans are VERY keen to become owners of.Capt. Scott is drawn into a cat and mouse game across Europe as he tries to get back to England with his possession.Along the way, Archer tells us a wonderful story full of intrigue, betrayal and twists and turns.
