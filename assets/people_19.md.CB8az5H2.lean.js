The book lacks personality as Hamilton gives a polite discourse upon the historical origins of the story being told.

I have been a Longarm fan for a long time and I have reviewed numerous western novels. I did not like some of the ghost writers who have written Longarm novels because they failed to really know and understand the intricate western lingo, the habits, the likes and dislikes of Custis Long. However, this book was not only well written, but had a great story line and interesting characters. The language and habits of Custis Long, United States Deputy Marshal, working for Billy Vail out of Denver, Colorado are clearly understood by this author.From the beginning chapter, when Custis finds himself in bed with a dead woman. We all know our hero's fondness for the ladies but to his knowledge he has never killed any woman while making love the them. I never give away too much because it spoils it for the readers. However, this story flows beautifully. Not only is a dead woman in his bed, he can't remember who she is or what he is doing in this town.Needless to say, it all comes together at the end of this western saga. This novel gets my highest rating because it is a darn good story and a real page turner. The author clearly understands the Longarm formula.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Monadnock Defensive Tactics System)"},{"Title":"Longarm 329: Longarm and the Restless Redhead","review":"Marshall Custis Long continues to catch the bad guys and love the more-than-willing ladies. This is #329 in the Longarm series and held my attention as did many of the others. Don't expect great thought-provoking literature here...what you get is good old entertainment and adventures, and the \\"man\\" that can handle anything as it comes along - one moment a gunfight or a barroom brawl, and the next to loving a gorgeous woman. In this one, he finds himself waking up in Arizona next to a very dead redhead, and all his identification papers are gone. Because he is Longarm, he will prevail. A good yarn for a fun romp through the Old West (if it ever existed)."},{"Title":"Longarm 329: Longarm and the Restless Redhead","review":"Custis Long wakes up in Medallion, Arizona, with a head full of pain, no memory of how he got there, and a dead redhead sharing his bed. Worse, someone has made off with his U.S. Marshal badge and papers. Set up for murder, Long knows he's got to find the real killer, but to do that he's got to remember what he came to town to do and find out who wants to stop him - before he ends up the guest of honour at a lynching party...Tabor Evans comes up with a great plot that had me hooked from beginning to end. The first six chapters throwing up many questions that had me as confused as Longarm.As more and more characters are introduced, all that seem to know Long, the harder it becomes to put this book down as the twist and turns combine in a story filled with action, intriguing characters of both sexes, and mystery.It's also good to see Tabor Evans making references to events and people, such as Jessica Starbuck, from Longarm's past and including some of his old sayings such as \\"eating the apple one bite at a time.\\"This is definately a Longarm book worth your time. Recommended.And just a comment on the other review which states that the book reads more like a detective novel, then why not? After all Longarm is a lawman who investigates criminal activities."},{"Title":"Longarm 329: Longarm and the Restless Redhead","review":"This is the April 2006 episode in the long running popular Western Series,Longarm. Too bad though,that it is much more of a \\"whodunit\\" murder mystery than a real western like the series is all about.Normally, it doesn't take Longarm long to find out who the \\"bad guys\\" are;and then we get a good ,action-packed saga of Longarm hunting down the bad guys and bringing them to justice--dead or alive.Also included ,is some pretty good history of the Old West,some real feel of the surrounding country and on top of that,some interesting and well developed characters.That is not what this epidode is. Here we get our hero Longarm turned into a Detective, such as you find in a Detective story or a Murder mystery.Most of the book has Longarm wandering around trying to figure what happened to him,who did it to him,and posing as an undercover sleuth to two different groups at the same time. Suspects and motives abound and around and around we go ;till nearly the end of the story;when the mystery is solved. The last chapter is taken up with an explanation of all the whys and wherefores of who did what and what were the motives.So,if a Murder Mystery is your preference,you may enjoy this;but if you're into action-packed Old West Westerns of the Longarm style--forget it!My title is a quote from page 179 and expresses my sentiments to a tee!"},{"Title":"Rising Tide: Gender Equality and Cultural Change Around the World","review":"The information gets 4 stars, but the writing style put me to sleep, so that gets a 1.

In retrospect that disapprobation was the kind of seal of approval that \\"banned in Boston\\" came to embody. Previous histories drilled deep into one facet of history. Braudel's was a pioneering effort in multidisciplinary historical analysis. It captures the historical flow that evolves civilizations, sacrificing only the detail outside the themes. Even subsequent to \\"A History of Civilizations,\\" other historians have been unable to write a thematic survey that matches this original. And don't be tempted to skip the \\"soft\\" introductory chapters with titles like \\"The Study of Civilization Involves All the Social Sciences,\\" and \\"The Continuity of Civilizations.\\" These tee up the hard topics, like \\"The Greatness and Decline of Islam.\\" There's method in Braudel's approach, and it takes patience. Braudel's translator, Richard Mayne had his job cut out for him. The complex syntax is that of a French intellectual of the sixties, and it is retained in Mayne's text, but you become accustomed to it. Don't look for maps or photographs in this Penguin Paperback; the text alone is six hundred pages. There's only one other book in this space, \\"From Dawn to Decadence,\\" by Jacques Barzun. In my view they are complementary."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"Braudel is considered one of the great 20th c. historians. He fought the French educational establishment to broaden the scope of history to include material from sociology, anthropology, geography, etc., and above all economics. This was in opposition to the traditional kings and battles approach, and this book was intended as a textbook (not accepted by the authorities). Arguably the movement's been quite fruitful, but this book is a very mixed bag - occasionally excellent, sometimes quite bad, and usually mediocre to good. It's also not a history of civilizations - it deals with what Braudel considered the great living civilizations - and rather than being history as usually understood, it describes primary characteristics of each with some development over time. Even the treatment of each \\"civilization\\" varies a great deal from one to the next, e.g. considerable space is devoted to the literature of Latin America while not to the others. The civilizations included are the Muslim World, Black Africa, the Far East (includes India), then Europe and European civilization elsewhere (to which he devotes half the book).In spite of the many gaps, blind spots and weaknesses, there are some real high points and original insights. For example, Braudel points out that, while the Crusades are usually seen as unmitigated folly in the West, and while they achieved nothing lasting on land, at their beginning the Mediterranean was dominated by Islam while at their end it was dominated by the West. This had important consequences limiting Islamic power and culture while removing constraints from those of the West. He's probably at his best dealing with the West and Islam, and at his worst dealing with Latin America. To his credit he doesn't pass over Africa as so many do, but gives it reasonable attention, describing among other things the great trading societies which grew up as a result of contact with Islam. His take on the United States is fairly sane, with useful analyses of the evolution of American capitalism and of the centralization of power and growth of bureaucracy in the Executive branch of the Federal government. But the section on the US has its share of romanticisms and a couple chauvinisms (that statement probably applies to all societies outside Europe, and perhaps to European ones as well). His take on the Soviet Union is balanced to slightly sympathetic, although it's odd that we never hear of the millions killed by Stalin (or Mao).Braudel's rejection of traditional historical narrative, with its landmarks and mileposts, sometimes leaves you wondering what, where and when it is that he's talking about. More importantly, he has a great weakness for making overarching generalizations, usually devoid of rational arguments stocked with facts which might lead us to share his conclusions. It's often transparently obvious that these generalizations can neither explain the entire phenomenon they purport to explain, nor can the explanation be so simple. After a few of these you start to question Braudel's judgment. He also spends a fair amount of time contemplating then-contemporary problems and speculating about the future. He defends this, but his performance is unconvincing, particularly in light of events since he wrote (1962). All the same, for someone who doesn't expect this book to be comprehensive or even, and who reads it along with world histories which are, it's still worth reading for its strengths and for the not-infrequent original insights."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"It was always going to be difficult to write a book about Civilizations. The decision tree alone of what information to include/exclude would be a significant problem.Braudel's thesis is that religion, culture and geography, together with traditional tools of history are all important in understanding civilizations. This is a true and accurate perspective.He concentrates on Nth America, Europe, Asia, Islam and Africa. His chapter on Islam, and the first civilization studied, was outstanding and certainly he was able to tie in his thesis to this examination. However, I got the impression he got lazy, and ended up providing cobbled sketches of the other civilizations, and concentrating more on history than analysis. Hence why Great to good."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"If you are going to take a test (AP, IB, CLEP ect.) This is an excellent, accessible overview.

Meant for French lyc&eacute;ens in their last year before sitting for their bac exam, it was a failure. However, looking at today's situation of the west vis-&agrave;-vis the Islamic and other non-western worlds, it is a jewel.

However this book is a little dated now. Originally this was published in the 1960's, so it reflects a Cold War era point of view. This especially comes through when he isn't talking about western cultures. For example, he expresses a fear that the Islamic cultures, due to the large number of desperate and poor people, would abandon their traditional religion, Islam, and take up the banner of Communism. Well, as we can see today, Islam will last a few thousand years longer than Communism. Also there are a few mistakes in this book. On a map showing the division of Spanish-speaking Latin America and Portuguese-speaking Latin America, countries such as Jamaica and Haiti are shown to be a part of Spanish-speaking Latin America.It's not all bad though. The section on the development of Europe is excellent. Also this might be useful as a sort of time capsule. Those who are interested in a Cold War view of history would like this. If you're looking for the history of civilizations though, you should look for a more modern and complete source."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"Fernand Braudel was born in 1902 in northwestern Lorraine, France and died in Paris in 1985. This book represents his view of historical events over the past several centuries. I am not a historian so I appreciated and enjoyed the high level discussions and wide ranging views of world history rather than its tedious details. It brought back a lot of memories of great teachers long past. I highly recommend this book to non-historians as good refresher of world history during the past several centuries. It is also a great book to read on a business trip."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"Fernand Braudel first published this excellent, one-volume \\"history of the world\\" over 50 years ago. As Howard Zinn would later attempt in the United States, Braudel wanted to change how history was taught in France. He wanted to move away from what is now called the \\"Big Man\\" theory of history; that is, that all historical events are the results of the decisions of a very few men, who mainly lived in the West. He wanted to include numerous other factors, the lives of ordinary people, and their economic base, (and was admirably aided by Theodore Zeldin in this effort), and he strove for a greater emphasis on non-Western civilizations. In undertaking such an effort in the early \`60's, he was ahead of his time, and to a very large measure, succeeded. Braudel is a synthesizer; striving for the \\"big picture\\" of historical actions, so it is only natural that early in his work he referenced the Hindu philosopher Chatterji, and his famous parable about the blind men and the various parts of the elephant that they can feel, yet cannot see or deduce the whole.Others have criticized the amount of material covered on \\"other\\" civilizations (too much or too little); I felt it got it just about right. He starts, suitably enough, with the now very topical Islamic world. It was rather astonishing to have Braudel quoting from an Afghan intellectual, Najm oud-Din Bammat, on the requirements for Islam to undertake internal revolutions like the Reformation and the Enlightenment, and even that \\"...the Muslim countries are still waiting and searching for their Garibaldis.\\" Braudel has been criticized for his thin section on Africa, less than 50 pages, before he moves on to the civilizations of the Far East, China, India, Japan and the \\"Maritime\\" countries, which he covers with 150 pages. Europe receives 120 pages; all of the Americas, 120 pages; a \\"nod\\" of 20 pages to the British Commonwealth countries, and he concludes with 50 pages on what was once called the Second World,--the Soviet Union, and associated \\"bloc\\" countries. The proportions in the coverage seem about right to me.The book contains much that is prescient and insightful. Consider, on China: \\"In 1945, she was unable to make a motor-scooter; by 1963 she was on the brink of producing an atomic bomb.\\" And what would he say now? On the concentration of power in the elites, consider his quote from Lenin: \\"If Tsarism could last for centuries thanks to 130,000 aristocratic feudal landowners with police powers in their regions, why should I not be able to hold out for a few decades with a party of 130,000 devoted militants?\\" (And indeed Lenin did!, before joining that proverbial dustbin). Braudel also covers why the world speaks English and not French, largely due to the fact that the English were sending out in the mid-18th Century a million colonists compared to 70,000 for the French, , since the latter had fears of becoming depopulated. And he gave a wonderful nod to one of my favorite cities, Avignon. The author's arguments on historical trends are cogent; his brush is broad, and the read enjoyable. He anticipated the \\"butterfly theory,\\" without the name (the flapping of the wings of a proverbial butterfly in China might contribute to a tornado in Kansas). He did so by also referencing China, and spoke of the spread of the Chinese fashions of the T'ang period eventually reaching France, and the court of Charles VI; \\"... the heritage of a long vanished world-much as light still reaches us from stars already extinct.\\"Of course there are some flaws, and his political bias is sometimes extremely apparent. Concerning the Korean War, 1950-53, he uses the \\"party-line\\" term for the Chinese soldiers who intervened, calling them \\"volunteers\\" (p 272). And lawdy, did he ever get it wrong about America eventually adopting a European social model: \\"Despite special pleading by certain newspapers, Federal taxes are no longer seen as an unfair punishment imposed on the strong and able producers of wealth to benefit the lazy and incapable. Ever since the New Deal, the Federal Administration has been regarded \`as essentially beneficent'...\\" No, it was the other way around, the so-called Reagan revolution, and assorted talk show hosts managed to paint government as \\"the problem,\\" and helped spread the \\"revolution\\" to Europe, and weaken their social contract.A wonderful view of the world from the perspective of historical research of the \`60's. As Braudel says: \\"To see them (other civilizations) clearly one has to withdraw, mentally at least, from the civilization of which one is a part.\\" The book also contains some excellent maps and charts. A wonderful, solid 5-star view of why things are the way they are."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"Braudel writes well in French and the English translation is excellent. If you are looking for a comprehensive world history with great detail and thorough research, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a decent general survey of history written by a Frenchman during the height of the Cold War, then this is your book. Africa and the Americas don't get a lot of text and what little they get is extremely biased and fundamentally inaccurate, even for the time. I actually learned something new about East European, Russian and Indian history from this book."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"This book by Braudel covers the history of the main civilizations of the world. Overall, I liked the book, but it is a very slow read I thought.Braudel was French and intended this book as a high school textbook in France; perhaps for better students. It was not accepted for this purpose. I tend to agree that it might have been a bit much for people of high school age, but maybe his point was to raise standards to what they might possibly be. I'll leave that debate to others.The author did not follow the usual \\"kings, dates and battles\\" approach. It seemed to me that he took the viewpoint of someone above the fray and included economics, arts and other important aspects of civilizations to a greater extent than usual, and put it all in some sort of context, including where different civilizations come into contact. Made the history all the more interesting I think.As an American, I found it interesting to see how things looked from a French perspective. It was somewhat different from what I usually read by American and British authors. That being said, it is a bit difficult to explain that difference. Maybe it was the context and examples being taken from French history and experience that are often less well known to Americans (and the British perhaps as well). Given that there was a lot of ground to cover in a limited amount of space, many examples were mentioned in quick passing, so it could be hard to keep up so to speak.This book was translated from French by Richard Mayne, who is British. Braudel apparently used some very complex sentence structure that the translator maintained using British English. The result was something that I found difficult to read other than slowly. Took a lot of the enjoyment out of the book for me.The book was first written in the 1960's, but some updates were present in this edition, at least up to the 1990's. Not sure at all how that was done, since Braudel died in 1985.There is a large amount of introductory material in the book. I'd say to read it as it explains Braudel's approach, among other things, which is helpful in making sense of the big picture he is going for in the book.I found the chapters on Islamic civilization quite interesting. Made many current events in that part of the world make much better sense to me.Braudel also seemed to be quite \\"respectful\\" when talking about American civilization which not every French author seems wiling to do. This is also much on how Anglo-Saxon civilization and the use of English became and still are (to large extent at least) so dominate.There is more that could be said covering other parts of the book, but I will leave that to others to discuss.The book is about 600 pages, and I think would take a while for most people to get through. Still, I think it a worthwhile read I think."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"I am not an academic, nor do I have a great command of history. But while reading this book, I got completely consumed by it in the begining, but as it progressed onto europe e.t.c... I found it harder and harder to read.But the first half was amazing! Given the subject matter is such a large undertaking."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"This book is a mixed bag, and I find myself explaining this book in two ways. I loved the sheer amount of information this book expounds upon, but was often confused by the manner in which it does so. It often seems that every other sentence jumps to a completely new idea, leaving me in a state of, sorry to say, \\"WTF?\\" The layout is confusing as well, and the coherence is lacking in a large degree. I gave this book three stars only because of its potential. The only time I would recommend this book would be to a college humanities class where the professor can go over the book piece by piece."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"This essay is a classical book from the 1960s, about the idea of civilization and the different ones that Braudel considered that were in existence. Some descriptions are brilliant, others not quite. But they all are a good introduction to some of them, unknown to us, like Islam or Black Africa.He explains their history, their past and present. There're very surprising historical facts. For instance, about slavery and the enormous demographic tragedy that meant for Africa. Millions of men and women were captured and brought Westward to America and Eastward to Moslem countries (the Turkish Empire, Arabic peninsule) and he gives higher numbers in those sold as slaves to Moslem countries than those sent to America. Braudel considers that there are real alive Africas in America (in Brazil or the Caribbean islands) while no trace of those wretchs sent to Islamic lands can be found, as if swallowed up by the sands of hot desserts.We know a lot about slavery towards America but very few about that bleeding towards Arabic countries, some of them still defend and practice slavery, for instance in the Arabic peninsule.Those facts were the most touching for me because it shows the difference among civilizations towards the other one, the one that is different, and I was so disconcerted that for once I couldn't come to any conclusion about anything this book told me.Which I guess is a good starting point.Still, the second part told me nothing and it was dificult to finish. I'd put 5 stars to the chapters I-IX and none to the rest. So I guess 2 is a fair average."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"If you want a better understanding of how the world has come to be what it today is, then this book is a good first step in so doing. Braudel was an influential French historian specializing in the Mediterranean, so his insights into the evolution of Europe are more insightful than other regions he highlights (but he is insightful throughout). Excellent book to read while you bask in the sun with your feet dancing in Lake Michigan on a tourist beach (as I did). Maybe the atmosphere I had while reading made me enjoy it more; nonetheless, one should read this if they have any desire to."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. \\"A History of Civilizations\\" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book.Instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events, Fernand Braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography, history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization. A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the \`deep end' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader.If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a \`time capsule' of facts then."},{"Title":"A History of Civilizations","review":"I read this bookk when it was just published, years and years ago.

Orange Laughter is brillantly written in a style like none other. A totally enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"Thomas Hardy once explained what he believed the purpose of fiction to be. It is to give pleasure by gratifying the love of the uncommon in the human experience, mental or physical, and this succeds most when the reader is made to feel that the characters have as much reality as he has himself/herself. Leone Ross accomplishes this in a masterful fashion as she takes us on a wonder journey through the mind of Tony (the protagonist). The ride is intriguing with twists and turns and a huge dose of the unexpected. This novel will enchant, surprise and mystify; but ultimately, it will satisfy. Ross improves upon her previous brilliant work &quot;All the Blood is Red&quot; with a giant stride in &quot;Orange Laughter&quot;. Her sensitiveness to what makes us tick as human beings is remarkable. Her ability to communicate it, moreso. This of course raises the bar for her next work. But until such time, there is much to enjoy in what she has written thus far."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"Orange laughter will stay with you long after you've read the last page. Ms. Ross's journey into the main character's deranged mind is riveting. The journey down the tragic road of the segregated south turns out to be a surprising love story that I simply could not get out of my head for days..."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"Orange Laughter moved me, big time. The characters are powerful and the attention Ms Ross pays to their rendition is awesome. It took me on a roller coaster ride through the sewers of New York to the terrifying beauty of North Carolina. This is a book of intriguing juxtaposition as well as a fascinating age-old tale of internal struggle between good and evil. This is a book about a man at war with himself. Ms Ross deserves maximum respect...for a woman writing from a male perspective. What is also impressive is that despite the darkness and desperation of this writer's themes, she pulls hope and redemption from the whole tangled web and leaves you ultimately wishing and hoping for the best. Immaculate."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"This novel has an excellent plot. Be patient with the first few chapters and you will be rewarded with an in-depth and mind-boggling analysis of the psyche of the protagonist and a stunning denoument from the cleverly woven details of the story. When I finally got to the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down until I read the last word. It was well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"Who says a page turner can't engage all of your mind? This book - I could not put it down, I read it all in one sitting. The author's touch is as beautiful as it is sure. A master-piece of storytelling. A structurally sound and exquistely expressed story. I enjoyed the use of the lack of punctuation when Tony spoke. I could see him without description. A man whose escape from his history comes to an abrupt halt in a New York subway. Ross's description of American southern life in the 60's, is finely judged. The boxing match is a miracle of tension. Her characters live. Her prose sings. She is a writer of visions."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"I could not put this book down: it is stunning -beautiful, disturbing, frightening: brilliant and should have won prizes. The language is rich and urgent, the characters and settings compelling, the messages about good and evil and humanity are ones that we all should heed. Read it."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"This is a wonderful and moving book. I read an extract from it once, and made a point of getting it...and I'm glad I did! The characters are all so unique and intruiging and the writer brings you right into their world. My favourite character would probably be Mikey, the young, overweight friend to the main character Tony, due minly to his innocence and kindly ways.The story takes you round many different corners and back again without leaving anyone behind. And as with many great books, the secrets unravelled throughout will no doubt bring a smile to your face or tears to your eyes.Thank you Leone Ross for this chapter in my life of books..."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"I just finished Orange Laughter.

I stayed up quite late several nights straight and really didn't want to put this book down at all!I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"Ralph Ellison is still alive. This novel is a typical continuation of his themes. One black man entirely locked up Underneath or Below, in the Subway maze of corridors, tracks and blind rooms is the storyteller. He is also locked up in his lost memory that he is going to recapture little by little. And what will come out of it ? A brilliant black woman, Agatha will reveal her mystery. She is the granddaughter of a black minister in North Carolina, but she is the daughter of a white man and her mother was beaten to death by the grandfather of this white man. She will deliver her child in the hands of the brother of this white man. The minister will get a tooth for a tooth, a child for a child, and the brother of the white man, Agatha's uncle, will look after her and then what was to happen will happen, even if it is a blind alley and a dead end. The white man, Agatha's father, will go away and have another child from another woman, this time white. She will die and then the father will die and the child will be entrusted to his grandmother who will come back to the father's town to find his relatives, but she ignores his real name. Fate will bring the white boy and Agatha, brother and sister, together, and the other boy, the black boy Agatha is taking care of and who is our storyteller, will become the friend of the white boy. White and black are so entangled together that they cannot be separated. The whole story takes place in the Civil Rights Movements era and the Ku Klux Klan is all-powerful in this small town of Edene, the badly-named Edene. This will dictate the events and Agatha, her white brother and her black child will get swallowed up in the hatred that goes along with KKK and the emerging Civil Rights Movement. The end will be tragic. Both boys will manage to go to New York and get lost in the Big Apple, the white one successful and the black one rejected or rather dropping out. They will also manage to reestablish a connection, communication and memory, coming back to the black boy, who is now over forty, a door will reopen of a new relation between the two boys, Mikey and Tony. The stuff is heavy, pungent and strong. The novel is interesting and quite easy to read and follow. It shows how guilt, desire and hatred are all twisted out of shape and embedded in all loving postures. Yet something sounds and feels awkward if not out of pace. It is bleak enough to be true, and yet the divided personalities, loyalties and lives are rather well shown on the black side but remain kind of schematic on the white side. The wall standing between the two communities is well rooted in white fear and hatred, but it is insufficiently rooted in the same feelings on the black side. The author seems to be overprudent to describe the hatred, not the fear, the Blacks feel in front of white injustice or rather social and historical injustice. Relations with people from the other side was just as much rejected on the white side as on the black side. This latter rejection is not entirely felt and depicted : it is too much seen as a response to the stimulus of white hatred. It is not only that : the concept of difference, uncrossable difference existed and still exists on both sides, blocking the possibility for America to see that all it represents and it has invented is the result of a constant give-and-take process between the two communities, the result of a cooperation that nearly no one has the courage to show and assume, except maybe Ralph Ellison in the most recent half century. We do not reach the concept of democratic diversity that is emerging at that very period of time (1960s and 1970s) in Ralph Ellisons's writings and thinking. A great book that deals with memory that blocks history in its loss and that unblocks life in its recovery.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Orange Laughter","review":"What a great book. Small, but packs a punch.This is on my top ten best reads."},{"Title":"Therapy","review":"Mike is a somewhat conservative gay man in his late 20's, who has a good job as a mental health counselor and \\"life coach\\" in a small city in the UK. His own life seems to be in a rut, with a job he doesn't particularly like, and living in a flat he also sublets to two straight roommates, one male and one female. Except for trips to the gym, and outings with his best friend (Jess, a straight woman from work), Mike is very much a homebody, who rarely goes out to the discos and is sees no point in dating someone who is not his \\"type,\\" which would be someone who is confident, masculine and fit, as he is.Mike's boring life is shaken up a bit, when he attends a family wedding with Jess and meets James, an attractive, witty physician to whom Mike develops an instant attraction. Unfortunately, so does Jess, and the feeling seems to be mutual, based on the site of them kissing passionately at the coatroom. Mike assumes James is therefore straight, but subsequent encounters reveal the truth, that, although he had never had an ongoing relationship with another guy, James is similarly attracted to Mike and wants to pursue that. The problem: By that time, Jess is in love with James, who finds her attractive as well, and Mike doesn't want to be the \\"other woman\\" that breaks up his best friend's romance. It all comes to a head when Mike, James, Jess and assorted friends go to a \\"Gay Fest\\" weekend in Manchester, and the nature of James attraction is revealed.\\"Therapy\\" is a funny, captivating and realistic story, with characters that are well-developed and engaging. Unfortunately, this first-time novelist has significant problems with grammar, punctuation, capitalization, syntax and improper use of words, and the self-publishing house he used didn't provide much in the way of proofreading or editing. The result is a book that averages at least one distracting error on every two or three pages, often making the reader pause to consider what the author *meant* to say, as opposed to what words are actually on the page. The book is heavy on dialogue and Mike's secret thoughts, which are rarely marked with proper quotation marks and often worded improperly (such as in cases where Mike calls himself by name in his own thoughts.) The author's overuse of italics to stress certain words in sentences is also distracting. It's a shame, because, with proper proofreading and editing, this could be a considered an excellent first novel. As it stands, I can give it no more than three stars out of five."},{"Title":"American History Simulations","review":"Do you want to make history come alive in your classroom? This book is packed full of hands-on, brains-on simulations that will really get your students thinking about some important events and concepts of American History. These activities help students to make an emotional connection with the historical events that shaped America by having them participate in role-playing simulations. My personal favorite is an Activity called &quot;The King's M&amp;M's&quot; (the kids loved it too!) I have used these activities in my 7th and 8th Grade American History class and have been thrilled with the discussions it has inspired. These simulations grab the students from the start and keep them hooked. Try them!"},{"Title":"American History Simulations","review":"I recently ordered this book for teaching fifth grade social studies. The simulations to not all align with the emphasis of US history in 5th grade but there is enough to make the book worth buying. This week I adapted the simulation \\"Brown Gold\\" and hid a brown slip of paper on the playground. The winning team were given a Chocolate candy bar to share. We came back to class and debriefed our experiences using the questions in the book. The questions are just listed for discussion, but I typed them and left space for students to answer each question individually. My students were amazed and understood how the drive to find gold lead the Spanish conquistadors to America. I also like how the book has questions that you can use for students to search for as they read their Social Studies book. The simulations lend themselves well to being used as an anticipatory set before you actually teach the lesson. I will probably use about four of the Simulations from this book in my classroom this year. An 8th grade or 11th grade teacher would find that even more of the Simulations align to their curriculm. As a classroom teacher, I recognize that there are definately ways this book could be revised for ease of use in the classroom. But for now, this is the best book published for using simulations to teach 5th grade social studies."},{"Title":"American History Simulations","review":"I am not a social studies teacher specifically.

Interesting activities - some are not so much simulations as activities, but they involve putting yourself in the participants place mentally at least - nice format that summarizes objective, materials needed, etc at beginning of each simulation. Good discussion suggestions and follow ups included as well. Reproducible pages and a minimum of outside materials needed. Easily adaptable to different age groups I think but 8th grade can basically use it straight out of the book."},{"Title":"American History Simulations","review":"Great product and received very quickly. I will use this product during the school year and my students will love it. It is awesome!"},{"Title":"Cassino: Portrait of a battle","review":"With &quot;Cassino:The Hollow Victory&quot; by Ellis being the standard, this book is a close second. It is also much easier to find, which avid military readers must keep in mind. The book starts out with the overall situation of the Italian front, describes the importance of Cassino, and descibes to battle to the reader. It seems like every book on the Italian Campaign sets up the books topic (compare with books on the Bulge and D-Day), the reader who is knowledgeable will breeze thru it and get to the heart of the book. If you can't find Ellis's work, grab this one."},{"Title":"Cassino: Portrait of a battle","review":"There may be many things that people can find wrong with this book: not enough perpective from the German side, not enough linking it to the general political strategies for the push in Italy, etc. It is however rightly regarded as &quot;The&quot; classic account of this battle. The book roughly describes the 4 phases of the battle that went on over 6 months.1) The initial poorly prepared, and exhausted, American attack across the Rapido, how it was doomed to failure from the start.2) The initial battle of the ridges behind the town and the rough complex night and day engagements on the ridge between the Indian/ Gurkha companies and the German Paratruops (now there is the very definition of tough fighting; Gurkhas and German Paratruppen).3) The attack of the marvellously well-equipped New Zealand Division in the town and the brutal house to house fighting and close in urban combat that went absolutely nowhere.4) The last phase where, after trememdous build up and a weaking of the German defences to shore up Anzio, British-Commonwealth, Polish and French troops pushed in and broke the line after some of the most intense bombardment of the war.One should not forget that Majdalaney fought in these battles and has an eye for detail. He maintains that although the Germans were on the surrounding heights of the monastery, they were scupulous in trying to move out the civilians and priests and never violated the Abbey. But it was never necessary that they be in the monestary anyway since the high ground around the monastery more than met the German observation needs.Majdalany also ties in the battle well with the events in Anzio and how the Cassino battle played in counterpoint with that on the beaches. I am sure that there will always be another 800 page opus on any battle, the product of our societie's obsession with the word processing software, that will offer ever more detail, but for a measured history covering all of the main points of the battle --- all in under 300 pages ---- then it will be hard to beat Majdalany."},{"Title":"Cassino: Portrait of a battle","review":"This book describes in detail the four battles for Cassino from the Allied perspective. It has many good points. For example the clarification of why Mountain tops are important even if they do not have troops on top (they are observation bastions that can direct artillery fire to any place in the map). Also during the description of the operations it makes clear the point that a Division on attack does not attack shoulder-to-shoulder with all available strenght. Rather one or a few of the Infantry battalions (which use one or two of its companies) attack to establish an initial penetration and then other battalions held in reserve use this penetrations as springboards for further attacks. If the attack fails the battalions in reserve may not even attack at all.Although allied operations are described in detail and its order of battle established sometimes to the Company level, it almost forgets the German side. For much of the book you only know that they are fighting the &quot;Germans&quot; and their defensive maneuvers and countermeasures are either not described at all or they are commented at a very general level.All in all it is a book worth reading. One has to remember only that its scope is the Allied offensive operations."},{"Title":"Cassino: Portrait of a battle","review":"This book provides a basic overview of the battle for those seeking an introduction to the battle. However, the book does not thoroughly cover the battle in an in-depth manner. For example, very little perspective is provided as to the German side from nearly all aspects. For example, German goals and strategies as well as troop, weapon and supply dispositions are barely covered. The fact that the majority of German troops were elite is barely even mentioned. From the allied perspective, on the other hand, a much better picture is provided. This is true not only of strategies and objectives, troops and supply dispositions but officer interaction at the highest command (this is not even touched upon on the German side). When the book was written (1957) this was not a surprise as the German records were probably not organized enough for original research to be conducted and there was probably also a lack of serious secondary research for the same reason. But as of 2007 this is definitely not the case. Better researched books probably exist due to the fact that this problem has been overcome.All and all a good introduction to the reader who knows little about the battle but does little to satisfy the appetites of those who are seeking a more in-depth history and analysis of the battle."},{"Title":"Reasoning Into Reality: A System Cybernetics Model and Therapeutic Interpretation of Buddhist Middle Path Analysis","review":"The title of the book says a lot about it (unsurprisingly). If you are not interested in system cybernetics, such as the first 2 reviewers, you should not (obviously) pick up the book and attempt to read it. To say \\"I don't understand it so its bad\\" or \\"there's too many big words\\" is really infantile. This book is aimed at the intellectual. His other books, such as Radiant Mind are entirely experiential therapeutic meditation handbooks that anyone can understand! Read those instead, if you don't have a philosophy degree."},{"Title":"Reasoning Into Reality: A System Cybernetics Model and Therapeutic Interpretation of Buddhist Middle Path Analysis","review":"This is not a book for light reading. This is a book for deep ontological self-analysis and, in fact, meta-analysis. Given the ontological constraints intrinsic to the tome's underlying topic, the author writes with immense precision, coherence, generality, and compactness. You do not need to know anything about either Buddhism or System-Cybernetics as prerequisite to this treatise, but you do need to be prepared to look up words and concepts as you read it, and to deeply contemplate its intricate abstractions.Furthermore, on a personal level I have through self-application found its extracted therapeutic model exceptionally enlightening: constructive toward both richer cognitive self-regulation and ratiocination.If the book still interests you, then you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Reasoning Into Reality: A System Cybernetics Model and Therapeutic Interpretation of Buddhist Middle Path Analysis","review":"This book attributes inconsistent premisses to Madhaymika, and then, wonder of wonder, finds that contradictions can be deduced.

It is not too much where it can overwhealm you and not to little where you can miss out important history. The best part is that if my kids find a historical event that intrests them, we can take a breake and find more info of that history at our local librery. No more jumping around and be confused of when it happend or why it happend or what led to that event. Because it is written in order of events, it makes it easy to understand our world and its history. also my kids love the true an false game it offers. I look foreward to make a time line with them as the book tells you how and when to do it. It also has pre tests to see if the kids know anything of the next history events.As I said we love this book. I also boaght the CDs of this book for our long trips.

Author Linda Lacour Hobar (a homeschooling mother herself) set out to show her own children how all of history was His Story - that the events of the human past all point to His glory and His plans, ultimately to His Son - the centerpiece of His Story.Honestly, I don't think it gets any easier to do this than The Mystery of History. In Volume One Creation to Resurrection Hobar takes readers from a literal, seven-day creation, and a literal Adam and Eve through highly developed humans from the start, dinosaurs, the ice age, and on through to the coming of Christ. However, not only the events that you find in your Bible are included though in this volume of ancient history, biblical history does receive the lion's share of the text (just as it should!) The ancient cultures of China, Egypt, Greece, and Rome are also introduced along with the smaller, but fascinating Phoenicia, India, and even North America (not small geographically, but smaller in terms of mention - only one lesson). This is all done in a sweeping 108 lessons, designed to be completed over 36 weeks (at 3 lessons per week).These lessons are written in a conversational tone - not exactly narrative, but similar to Jeannie Fullbright's Young Explorers science series, as though she is speaking directly to your children. The text is written somewhat simply, an average fourth grader should definitely be able to read and understand it. My oldest daughter (currently 8) really enjoys the chatty style.Hobar provides much more than lessons, making this a rich, versatile curriculum. Each week begins with a pre-test which is designed to pique children's interest and get theme excited about the upcoming content and gauge what they already know. Each of the three lessons for the week consist of the one to two page lesson itself which is accompanied by suggested activities for three age groups: younger, middle, and older students. The activities for younger students are often hands-on projects while the activities for middle and older students often involve research, discussion, and could be used for reports as well. Each week closes with a review that includes timeline and geography work, and a quiz. Quiz's, pretests, and activities are all easy to opt-in or opt-out of depending on your family's needs.A full answer key is included at the back of the book as well as reproducible historical maps. I own the first edition and there are some issues with the mapping being difficult, but the answer keys are available at the author's website so you can just print and work from those. This has apparently been improved for the second edition, and the publisher Bright Ideas Press now carries an intriguing looking mapping product - Wonder Maps that includes everything you would need for historical map work. Instructions for constructing a timeline, memory cards, and an extensive supplementary reading list are also included for beefing up the program if you wish.The Mystery of History definitely is better suited for middle-elementary students. We gave it a spin when my oldest was six, but she was too young. Now that she is eight we are revisiting it. I think for families with a wide range of age ranges the little ones can tag along and pop in and out. They'll still learn a LOT. I'm sure my five-year-old will pick up quite a bit, but I won't be including her in the actual work or requirements. There are SO many activities included, don't feel like you need to do them all. There are a lot, and if you aren't so good at planning for hands-on (like me!) don't feel like you MUST do three activities a week (eek - that overwhelms me a bit!)Parents looking to have The Mystery of History Volume One all planned out should take a look at Illuminations Year One, a program that plans the history readings and activities along with literature, book studies, and schedules a wealth of other programs that you can choose to use or not. It plugs and plays geography, vocabulary, grammar, writing, science, Bible readings, DVDs, Diana Waring's audios, copywork (and more) and is available in plans for K-3, 3-8, and high school. It is well worth your time checking out the samples at the Bright Ideas Press website. Another thing I love is that Mystery of History and Illuminations both have active yahoo groups where the authors and publisher are available to answer questions personally. I really appreciate this screen-to-screen interaction.The Mystery of History is incredibly versatile. You can keep it simple and fairly open-and-go with just the text or you can buy supplementary coloring pages, audio cds, craft enrichment ideas, lapbooks, notebooking pages, memory work cards or go deluxe and get Illuminations. However you use it though, there's no doubt that you and your children will gain a solid grasp of the integrated flow of His Story from Creation through Christ and will be continually pointed towards the Author of this story. I'm a history curriculum junkie, but I honestly haven't found a better spine text that offers such excellent biblical history integration."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I bought the book to use with my 2nd-grader and 8th-grader together. This was a mistake, as the book presented very little information that my 8th-grader didn't already know, and too many unimportant tidbits that were confusing to my 2nd-grader. This is neither a big-picture introduction to World History, nor an in-depth secondary-level study. The book is well-suited for a first history text for 3rd-5th graders, I think. MOH is a good choice for a student who loves variety, as lessons jump in chronological order from one location and culture to another from day to day. This jumping around is a difficult format for a child who needs repetition. I ended up switching curricula in the middle of the year."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I used literature based history curricula before this one and enjoyed them a lot. Then I came to the Mystery of History and LOVED it. I had to move on to another history program after Volume II because the subsequent volumes were not out yet. (The author is now working on the fourth and final one.) The new curriculum that I've been using for last two years which is MANY TIMES more expensive is not nearly as satisfying as this series had been.If you are a Christian, it will make your heart glad and mind satisfied as you see how those people and events you learned in your religious realm existed in world history. If you're not a Christian, you'll gain a better understanding of this world as you observe how Biblical/Christian characters intermingled with the rest.My only fear in praising this history curriculum so highly is that your expectation might not be a realistic one and thus be disappointed in the end. If you're happy with what you have, stick with it. However, if you are looking for something else, perhaps a thorough history curriculum that will inspire (and maybe even convict!) you and your children, give this one a try. It's easy to use and will not break your bank. It's such a low risk item. EVERYTHING is in there; you may want to pick up a few historical readers for literature (recommended reading list is included in the book) and you're set. Relax and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"This book is wonderful. My 1st grader is using it now and he loves the lesson plans. There are different activities for different age groups. So far we feel like we are learning a lot. I plan on useing this book for the first part of the next school year. I will be teaching my daughter at the same time. We are not doing every lesson at this grade but when the time comes we will be using this book for 4th or 5th grade. At that time I will be doing the middle age activities that are provided in the book. I love that they take a time in history and let us know what was going on in different parts of the world. So we get a great idea of what was happening in China during the time Jesus was walking on earth. As a child I never even thought there was other people in other areas of the world during the time of the Bible. This line of thinking will not be shared with my children. Overall very happy with this book."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"This is an awesome resource for homeschooling.

However I am so hooked. Love Hobar's writting style. I explain it like she is writing a long letter to the reader. I actually bought volume 2 first and then went back and bought volume 1 after enjoying it so much. History was my worst subject and in high school I struggled with all the battles and wars we read about. There was a lot of peace in between all those wars. There is great world history that is told in story form. There are pretests, what do you know test, memory tests and even a set up in the begining of the book for grading. At the end of every lesson she has a project for kids to do. For younger readers, for middle students and for older students. Even when I am reading just for fun, I find I enjoy reading that too. Great book for homeschoolers or adding to homework from public schools at home."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I bought this book to supplement with our current history curriculum. It is a great book! I stay up at night reading it!! :)"},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I'm madly in love with History and my homeschooled kids are, too. So far, I've been picking and choosing different books to create my own History curriculum. But finally, this year we began to use The Mystery of History. The girls began 2nd grade with The Mystery Begins (Creation-1199 BC). I like this book so much because it combines Bible History with World History. And why should they be separate? That's simple--they shouldn't! This way, it's \\"Classical, Chronological, & Complete.\\"Today, we finished up the first week of The Mystery of History. We studied the lessons Creation (4004 BC), Adam and Eve (4004 BC), Jubal and Tubal Cain (10 Generations after Adam), and Noah & The Flood (2349 BC). The author, Linda Hobar, explains the dating system she uses (it's called the Ussher Chronology), smoothly combines biblical references with other historical records and scientific references, and has written these texts in a way such that they can be used with students of any age. At the end of each short lesson in the actual text, there are discussion questions for 3 age-groups of children.We aren't using the actual textbook but are using the audiobook via MP3 & the coloring pages. The reader's voice is soft and clear, a great storyteller's voice. My children listen to their lesson and we discuss it as they color the accompanying color sheet. The coloring sheets aren't too simple and are not cartoony--they're realistic and defined. You can actually listen to these free sample audio lessons and print some of the coloring sheets if you go their site:Lesson 20: Ark of the CovenantLesson 55: Nineveh DestroyedLesson 96: Julius CaesarLesson 100: Battle of ActiumLinda Hobar wrote these books \\"with the hope of inspiring generations to know God and make Him known.\\" I like that, and I also like the meaning behind the name \\"The Mystery of History.\\" It comes from Paul's letter to the Colossians:\\"I was made a minister. . . that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations; but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make know what is the riches of the glory of this mystery. . . which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. And we proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, that we may present every man complete in Christ.\\" (1:25-28) May you be blessed as you teach your children!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"This book is a great way to learn history.

What a exciting new homeschooling tool to get students excited about HIS Story! I wish I had this earlier!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I just received my copy of Mystery of History Vol. I. I am excited to start this with my daughter in the fall (5th grade). I looked for a long time at the Tapestry of Grace curriculum, but I couldn't justify spending the money with our small family. I was so glad to find MOH! It is an affordable alternative to Tapestry with a similar scope and sequence, and seems to be a little more user-friendly. It's definitely more kid-friendly. It is written so that kids can read the lessons for themselves. It seems that it is not as labor-intensive for the parent.I especially love the 'What do you know?' pretests that encourage them to see what they already know and makes them curious, and the 'take another look' or 'what did you miss' reviews & activities - then there are quizes every 2 weeks, too, which test their knowledge. All of this is in small bites so the information isn't overwhelming. There are many activities to do. Each lesson lists assignments for 'younger', 'middle' and 'older' students. There are 36 weeks of lessons in this volume. The author lists several examples of how organize your week.You will need to inlcude real books from a library (or you can buy some) to flesh out the lessons - but the same goes for TOG. I plan on making a time line as well.The only negative I can find so far is that the 5th (last) volume will not be published in time (planned for release in 2014 or 2015 ?), but we can find a substitute curriculum for that last little bit of history - no problem. The 3rd and 4th volumes should be released in time for us. (3rd this spring and 4th in 2011.) For more info you can go to the MOH website, but don't buy there. The prices are better elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I just have one complaint about this curriculum - I didn't write it! As a two-decade home educator, I've been trying to write a needed missing link in home education. This book is it!!There seems to be two basic types of history books out there:1. Textbooks that give trite summaries that fail to inspire our kids to interact with historical periods and that tend to instill a sense of boredom.2. Exciting \\"idea book\\" type hands-on programs that give timelines, maps, ideas, crafts, etc. that you are told to integrate with historical instruction. The problem is, most of us don't have the time, knowledge, or money to buy or research these historical periods to teach the \\"meat\\" of information we don't know ourselves. Plus, there are those days as a homeschooler where we need the kids to be more autonomous than others. If the curriculum depends on us 100% of the time, we're going to fail. If the curriculum depends on handing a kid a big book or computer and hoping they discern what the key points to isolate, they will often become distracted and fail. With this self-directed approach, assessment becomes a big issue - either by neglecting to test or by exhausting the home educator who is required to create these constant assessments.Mystery of History gives the beginner to advanced home educator the best of both worlds. A great, easy-to-read segment of history is covered each day. The student is able to read it themselves and then, is asked to write a summary card of the key point and dates. A timeline is recommended with the choice of format. The teacher can be as involved or uninvolved in the process as life dictates that day and then, can assess student comprehension based on the cards and regular testing provided in the manual. Additional ideas, crafts, reading etc. are given for varying grade levels that allow the teacher to amplify and expand the info given when desired.It's chronological (very helpful with learning challenged kids) and a perfect balance between self-directed and teacher supervised. Ample opportunities for creativity abound, but consistent no-frills flow is also insured. It works well with multi-grade teaching since the text is supplemented with advanced work suggestions.I love this and will just have to file away my efforts at writing the same concept."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I have used Mystery of History Volumes 1-3 with my eldest and am using MOH 1 again with my two younger children. This is the best history program I have found from a Christian perspective. It is not a Bible study curriculum, but does extensively include Bible history. It is not an in-depth program when used without doing any of the activities. Each lesson includes activities and there are lists of other resources that can be used to add further depth. The text covers major events and major trends in history, but doesn't go deeply into anything. This is where it is important to include assignments from the activities sections.The activities section is how the curriculum allows the teacher to delve more deeply into the areas of interest or that she thinks are important to cover more thoroughly. The curriculum is meant to include those not as extra activities, but as part of the curriculum. For older students, the activities are even more important than for the younger students.The main problem I have had in using Mystery of History 1 is in finding the information necessary to complete maps. Hobar does not appear to use a particular atlas that one can find all the information on. In the front of the book she suggests, \\"You'll also need to have on hand atlases from which to obtain information to record on your maps. I recommend both a Bible atlas and a historical atlas.\\" I have several good historical atlases, but there is still information she asks for that I am unable to find without also searching an encyclopedia and sometimes even then I cannot find what I need without extensive searching on the internet. I hope once she finishes this series she will go back and correct that problem by revising this volume. This is the one real problem I have with this volume. It is time consuming to have to search for information that she should have taken the time to give information on where to find it or better yet, to include the completed maps in the curriculum. We had a much easier time with this in MOH 3, but I can't remember if it was a problem for MOH 2 or not."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I was very disappointed in this text.I like that bible history is included in the chronology. However, I wanted more world history...too much of this text is bible history. We have had to delve into Mesopotamia, Egypt and China and Greece from other sources and therefor are quite \\"behind\\" for the year. And we haven't gotten to Rome yet.That being said, I did feel comfortable dropping our bible curriculum and just using MOH for that, although I do disagree with the author on some of the implications of the bible characters. (especially Gideon)I think this is more of a biblical history, with some stuff that was going on at the same time in the rest of the world...as opposed to a comprehensive world history text that includes bible history.My son does not care for history, and this text did not change his mind.I adore history, but find this text difficult to relate to and not detailed about the most interesting bits."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"Five stars is not enough for this product. As a Christian home schooling parent, I have been searching for a world history that teaches one true history. I wanted a curriculum that taught traditional world history along with biblical history. After trying several, I finally hit the jackpot with Mystery Of History. The presentation allows the reader to clearly see where biblical history falls in the timeline with traditional ancient history.I especially appreciate the author's work in putting together a \\"wish list\\". I was able to review her list and choose additional resources that I felt would work specifically for our family. In addition, at the end of each section she recommends exercises for children in 3 different age categories. The instructor is sure to find extending exercises that will work for his/her student.Homeschooling or not, if you desire for your student to understand true world history, you MUST have this resource."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"We are using this along with Story of the World Volume 1.

We use the Story of the World Activity pages and suggestions."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"I appreciate Linda's biblical foundations and biblical framework for teaching history. I have implemented her timeline activity for my first grader and we both enjoy it. Having said that, I will say that I much prefer reading the historical narratives, legends, and stories from \\"The Story of the World.\\" When I read to my first grader from Mystery of History, it goes over her head. I would not enjoy using Mystery of History on its own. I recommend this book and when we start the next section of history next year, we will be ordering her Volume 2 and the Story of the World, Volume 2 as well."},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"This curriculum is just what I was looking for! The events are in chronological order, integrating Biblical history with \\"secular\\" world history. This key element helps my kids see that Biblical characters were real and not fairy tale. So often we get one or the other but not both combined. This book also points out that man was created intelligent and innovative, judging from ancient artifacts, which are shown in photographs throughout the book. The pretests, map work, engaging activities, memory cards, reviews, and timeline reinforce what they've learned. The activities are divided for Older, Middle, and Younger students, so it is perfect for multi-level teaching. The lessons can be read to early elementary students, while the older students (6th grade & up) can read and study independently if desired. Further research and supplementation would be necessary for high school students. It is not overwhelming as I thought it might be. It is just right and my kids love it!!!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of History, Vol. 1: Creation to Resurrection","review":"The author has a lot of information that is correct, but she throws too much leven that levens the whole lump. In the activities she has you doing things like building the tower of babel by making a ziggurat(which is not pleasing to the Lord, serving idols) Her wording in the text is glorifying things like stonehenge stating that their were \\"intellegent minds\\" and \\"the amazing thing about the structure\\" There is nothing amazing about it. When a man is demonized he could probably have great strength and be able to move these stones into their placement. There is no mention of the human sacrifices done there. Also, the activity is to make a miniature version of stonehenge another idol. These are only a few things I have found so far. I purchased both volume I and II and I am also finding many things wrong with Volume II as well. For Volume II she tells you all the Paganism that Valentines Day comes from then she tells you to participate in it by making Valentine's Cards. We should stay away from all paganism.

Kate has created a wonderful blend of story and infomation. Books on NHS can be difficult to read and absorb. They also tend not to give a sense of the time that can be involved along the way. Of elements like learning your timing and feel, and how that plays into the learning process...for the trainer and the horse. Kate provides a wonderful narative along with the information that gives others interested in this approach a sense of the time involved. Not that it takes a LONG time, but when you see an experienced horseman get through to a horse in a few hours... and it takes you a few weeks, that can be discouraging ... you see in Kates story it does take some time..it does for EVERYONE that adopts this approach to working with horses... and sometimes it cold out, and sometimes its raining and you are wet to the skin... and that you're there for as long as it takes... and when you look back in a few months to see how far you and your horses have come, thats when you see the results and the progress in both of you...This approach works for all horses, all owners/trainers and you don't have to be 'handy' with a rope when you start.. you just have to have the conviction to keep going out there and trying again.. and again.. until it starts to come together...A really good read for those curious about the 'horse whisperer' tactics to find out whats really happening and that its not magic, its basic communication...Thank you so much Kate for documenting your experience."},{"Title":"East-West Healing: Integrating Chinese and Western Medicines for Optimal Health","review":"This book is for anyone who may be skeptical about eastern medical practices, but who may be longing for a better, more holistic view of medicine than is provided by their own western doctor.

You are able to learn the strengths and weakness of each method of healing so you can make up your own mind which is better or more effective. Its also a great, easy to understand primer of all the eastern philosopies and terms you've heard of before but not clearly understood like Qi, maintaining balance (yin/Yang), Accupressure, etc...A definite must read for anyone dealing with a chronic illness or who feels like they've reached the limit of what their western doctor can do for them."},{"Title":"East-West Healing: Integrating Chinese and Western Medicines for Optimal Health","review":"A terrific, power-packed book of practical information about the Chinese and Western systems of health and healing, and how you can apply them to your life.Valuable healing remedies and insights are on every page.

This was my first Bible study in 10 years and I found the format of the study friendly, encouraging and challenging. Barbara Henry asks the difficult questions of women - why are we built the way we are as individuals and as a group - all the while reminding us of our soft place to land in God's love. The study never felt like the word according to Barbara Henry, but rather a study in the true sense of the word. She encourages reading, researching, cross-referencing and discussing the tenets of Titus 2 so that we may encourage each other in discovering God's will for our lives. My recommendation is to use this study as another tool in your shed to sharpen your knowledge of the Bible, to discover God's intentions for your life and to find encouragement in your relationships with women. Ms. Henry's book was very effective in helping me do just that."},{"Title":"Woman to Woman: Life Principles from Titus 2 (Following God Discipleship Series)","review":"Titus 2 is one of my favorite passages of Scripture, and I believe its principles are desperately needed in the lives of Christian women today; that is why I am so disappointed half-way through this study.I am sure Ms. Henry loves the Lord and His Word, but she seems to have lost the meaning of the passage in the pursuit of novel interpretations rather than helping us apply the plain meaning of the text.For example, in choosing to substitute \\"teachers of beauty\\" for the translators'choice of \\"teaching what is good,\\" she leads us away from Titus 2 into a series of meanderings of ways \\"beauty\\" is mentioned in Scripture and makes leaps such as saying that \\"a primary function of a teacher of beauty would be to encourage the use of artistic gifts in younger women.\\" How can anyone support that claim from the Scriptural text?In the topic \\"Loving Husbands\\" the author tries to equate someone \\"walking in darkness\\" in 1 John 1:6-10 to a \\"single woman who refuses to admit she is hiding from love.\\" [\\"Darkness\\" in that verse is the word \\"skotia,\\" meaning the absence of Divine truth, and its associated wickedness.]She makes claims such as \\"Scripture refers to addictions as strongholds\\" but does not make a case for that assertion, and unfortunately there are other instances of concern throughout the half of the study I have completed.As in any study, there are some good quotes and some good points, but they are so disconnected from the emphasis of Titus 2 that she might have done better just writing a series of topical studies rather than attempting to force those ideas into a study of Titus 2.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this study because the young Christian will be misguided on some points and the mature will likely find it frustrating. Martha Peace's \\"Becoming a Titus 2 Woman\\" is a more biblically-accurate alternative."},{"Title":"Woman to Woman: Life Principles from Titus 2 (Following God Discipleship Series)","review":"I really appreciate this Bible study for women because it encourages not only thought-provoking, but also heart-searching discussion on the issues that Paul addresses to women in Titus 2.

We like the format in the Following God Series which provides root words, background notes, and scripture references and application questions. We also like the way the books provide references to other Bible verses which clarifies what we are studying. It helps when the author of a Bible Study book guides one to other places in the Bible that provide a similar verse or an in depth description of a situation that resulted in consequences. We move slowly by focusing on one day's lesson as presented for an entire week. In other words, it takes us at least a month to complete one week's lesson.

The art is exceptional.... it is rare to see black and white ink drawings that are so elegant in the use of line... but I was hopeing for a little more meat. A little more intrigue to pull me in, be it a story, or more unusual looking art. I found many of the drawings to be flat and elementary in their dipiction of crude sex acts and S&amp;M... whie others were amazing... a few fluid strokes of ink produced a horse that is twisting and turning in different angles, or a man who is reaching up, and dispite little to NO detail in his arms and muscles, you precieve depth... amazing. Overall, id you are interested in line art, or S&amp;M, this book is worth a look.... but if you are looking at something that will draw you into erotic graphic novels then I suggest any book starring Druuna (such as Morbus Gravis, or, my favorites: Creatura and Aphrodisia), or Girl by Kevin Taylor.

The simply black and white drawings leave the viewer/reader wanting more...and I truely hope Michael Manning will be producing more books in the future...they are simply amazing."},{"Title":"Lumenagerie","review":"Lumenagerie is a compendium of some of the finest, and most graphic yet, art by Mr. Manning. Within you will find statuesque dominatrices, women & men turned into birds, dogs, horses, and weirder things, and force dinto positions both painful and erotic. If you enjoyed his graphic novels, you will enjoy this work- with the caveat that there is no plot here, these are just freestanding works of art on the themes of BDSM and transformation."},{"Title":"Lumenagerie","review":"Best known for his series of erotic graphic novels beginning with The Spider Garden, the brilliant artist Michael Manning here showcases his stand-alone work in this beautiful large-format compilation of black and white line drawings.Manning's specialty is bondage, and he renders his subjects in a unique style that owes much to the lyrical and elegant simplicity of Japanese prints and Art Nouveau. For all the grace of line he shows, Manning's work is not simple, either in execution, setting, or apprehension. The scenes he depicts are complicated, the rendering simple but lush, and the emotions they arouse are deeply affecting.Elegant pen-and-ink drawings capture the imagination immediately, and invite the viewer into a world as disturbing as it is beautiful. I felt everything from startled recognition to unsettling arousal. This is art that makes no apologies, needs no explanation, and cannot really be described.It has become the worst of clich&eacute;s to laud an artist by saying that their work really needs to be experienced, but in this case it is true. Forgive the clich&eacute;, for Manning's work is wholly original and deeply felt. The tableaus he creates stay with you, right under the skin. For those who dare his vision, it is a rewarding journey.For those not acquainted with Michael's work, this is an excellent place to start. His unique vision is well worth a look.Most highly recommended. If you're brave, it's an excellent coffee table book."},{"Title":"Lumenagerie","review":"Michael Manning artistry is different from anyone else.All his work are collestors items.I enjoy looking and seeing something new everytime.Sex and BDSM pervade his work,making it even more interesting.This is a book of drawings but nothing but top of the line imagery!"},{"Title":"Lumenagerie","review":"I keep all of Manning's books inside of a secret library, because they are too risque to keep on my bookshelf.

But it is the subtitle (Modeling Across Scales), not the title, that conveys you what the book's content is about. In other words, the author engages himself in the (difficult) task of showing you how real materials can be modeled (or thought of) by mean of a multiscale approach bridging the atomistic to the macroscopic structure &amp; behavior. As you can well imagine, this is an outstanding task!The book is organized in four parts and it contains 13 chapters:Part I: Thinking about the Material World1. Idealizing Material Response2. Continuum Mechanics Revisited3. Quantum and Statistical Mechanics RevisitedPart II: Energetics of Crystalline Solids4. Energetic Description of Crystalline Solids5. Thermal and Elastic Properties of Crystals6. Structural Energies and Phase DiagramsPart III: Geometric Structures in Solids: Defects and Microstructures7. Point Defects in Solids8. Line Defects in Solids9. Wall Defects in Solids10. Microstructure and its EvolutionPart IV: Facing the Multiscale Challenge in Real Material Behavior11. Points, Lines and Walls: Defect Interactions and Material Response12. Bridging Scales: Effective Theory Construction13. Universality and Specificity in MaterialsConsidering the difficulty of the subject and how it has been presented throughout the book, the clarity of language and the good quality of both graphs and figures, this book deserves five stars."},{"Title":"Crystals, Defects and Microstructures: Modeling Across Scales","review":"This is the absolutely best book I have seen in the general materials science field--the writing is clear, the explanations excellent, and detail sufficient. The books title is correct, but I think a bit unfair--the book really shines as a general, graduate level introduction to all of materials science, if you take the quite reasonable view that the ability to better model crystals, defects, and microstructures forms the core of the field.As the author staes in the introduction, this books teaches you habits of the mind and modes of thought that help link up the disparate fields that make up materials, mechanics, and condensed matter physics.There is no book in my (admittedly limited) library I got more out of during the course of my studies.Final note: the book has excellent references, and is typset beautifully."},{"Title":"Crystals, Defects and Microstructures: Modeling Across Scales","review":"This book is the first book on computational materials science that embraces all the scales of modeling (as the title implies). The first 4 chapters are pretty much a review in Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics, and Condensed Matter Physics. This book could be used as a supplement text for a condensed matter physics course or a stand alone text for a Computational Materials Science course. This book is required reading for anybody doing modern materials modeling. Finally, Phillips has a lively writing style. For example, if you already know about tight-binding methods you will not be bored by reading that section in the book."},{"Title":"Vedic religion and philosophy","review":"This book provides a brief but comprehensive overview of the Vedas, the Upanisads and the Bhagavad Gita.

Smith's German-American Genealogical Research Monographs, from which we have reprinted this booklet, was an important instrument for achieving that objective. The author derived his list of emigrants for Hessen-Hanau from a register of the Privy Council of that former principality, which he discovered in the Staatsarchiv, Marburg, Germany. These passengers departed for America (principally Pennsylvania), as well as for Hungary, Lithuania, Pomerania, and Russia. (These Eastern European Germans should not be dismissed by U.S. researchers because their descendants may have taken part in the great Eastern European exodus of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.)For the researcher's convenience, the author has arranged this booklet in two parts: (1) the body of the work consists of a chronologically arranged list of emigrants as they appeared in the original register; (2) the balance is an annotated index of all persons named in the register with their ages, ship traveled on, date of embarkation, and any other information the author could attribute to them from Strassburger & Hinke's Pennsylvania German Pioneers."},{"Title":"Insight and Responsibility","review":"Erik Erikson's Insight and Responsibility is a must, even though it can be dense. Erikson, as a philosophical social psychologist and psychoanalyst is one of the first to mix psychology and anthropology with the meaning of social existence and survival.

It is as relevant now, if not more than ever..."},{"Title":"Words of Fire, Deeds of Blood","review":"Olivier Bernier is a master of narrative and a flawlessly thorough scholar. A Frenchman who has lived in N. America most of his life, Bernier has many superb books to his credit that deal with the Ancien Regime and the 18th Century. But in this oeuvre he has probably outdone himself. In his animated but well documented account, Bernier takes us on a very bouncy ride,indeed! His narrative plunges the reader right in the thick of the turbulence in Paris during the Summer of 1789. Leading the reader along to the point where the Royal Family attempts its botched-up escape in 1791, Bernier, than loops back to the background of Louis XVI's reign, the disasterous influence of Marie Antoinette and the growing financial crisis that led to Necker's recall and the convocation of the Etats-Generaux...Bernier then seamlessly resumes his history with the ill-fated flight and capture of the Royal Family at Varennes, their humiliating return to Paris, the Constitution of 1791, the eventual abolition of the Monarchy and the deaths of the King &amp; Queen. What Bernier has essentially done is present his history of events in a conceptual order rather than a chronological one...Still, he has wovern the fabric of his narrative so masterfully that there is scarcely a snag! The novice and the scholar will be enriched by this book. In it, Bernier also says things that were always evident, but that made historians uncomfortable. He asserts, with good reason, that much of the extremes of the Revolution that lead to the end of the Monarchy, could have been avoided if Marie Antoinette and her circle had been noticeably more welcoming to the deputies of the National Assmbly and their wives by recieving them socially and allowing the women of the rising third estate positions at court...Bernier's authority is only matched by his talents as writer... Certainly a rare and valuable combination!"},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed Nobody's Angel, but it wasn't one of my favorite Karen Robards novel.The story line and plot were creative and interesting ... A Marquis betrayed who ended up as a bound servant to a preacher's family in the Carolinas, but some of the characters fell a little flat. I think the book has a lot of potential, and was certainly enjoyable to read, but it could have been so much more.Susannah's character was a bit over the top in her criticism and anger. Ian was a bit too much of a rake at times. Susannah's father was excellently portrayed. But the book lacked clarity on Ian's past and his family. It moved too fast over parts that deserved more time. There were a bit too many characters vying for attention, that not enough was said about some of the main ones - like Soerena - was her role in the story even necessary?However, the story was enjoyable and many parts made me laugh - like Ian's attempt at farm work, peeling turnips, running from chickens and plowing.I enjoyed the romance, and I loved the ending, predictable as it was. I thought it was a good book, but it left me feeling like something was missing. I feel like this story was better done in the Banning Sister trilogy which the sisters in this book remind me of.Overall, I recommend it. It's an enjoyable book, a quick read, funny, and clever."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"I always love Karen Robard's books. This is an excellent read.

Now that I'm concentrating on my Kindle collection I'm so pleased to be able to add these books and at more reasonable prices than most Publishers charge for their Kindle ebooks.This is a sweet story, a fantasy of times long pasted, in which Ms Robards has created her own world. The story is told simply. The characters, at least the main characters, are fully developed, likable and interesting. Actually, it would have been nice to have seen some of the minor characters developed further. I've always wondered about the direction the younger sisters lives would take.Ms Robards writes very well and I, generally, always enjoy her books. My biggest complaint is that her works are not frequent and sometimes end abruptly - like she runs out of time to write to the full story. She creates some of the best characters in her genre."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"This book is like all of Karen Robards books; EXCELLENT.

The heroine dealt with her situation as well as she could. It was against her nature, her religion, to buy the indentured convict but she knew she had no choice.The hero, like the hero inAlyx, was a British nobleman who had been sent, originally to prison to by murdered but thanks to bribery, escaped with his life, only to be sold a bondsman. As we know fromAlyx, it happened in reality, I believe the name of the young man was James Annesley and he had been sold into slavery. After his return to England, his estates were returned to him but as far as I know, he never received his title back.What this book so aptly describes is two worlds colliding. An arrogant, good looking young man who never had to work in his life and an overworked young woman, who believed herself to be not pretty and definitely on the shelf, getting to know and love each other."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"This book has long been one of my favorite historical romances, including all the elements of a great read: intriguing plot, relatable heroine, and a hero that has a lot more to him than meets the eye. I am a big fan of Robard's historical romances - one of my favorite trilogies is her series on the Banning sisters - and I cannot say enough good things about Nobody's Angel.This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a departure in the normal \\"stunning\\" beauty with a fashionable figure and enviable social life - Sarah is the older sister who fades into the background when in the presence of her beautiful younger sister, yet Sarah ends up catching the eye of the handsome hero, who has a past of his own.Word of warning - this is not a suspenseful thriller like Robards' novels of recent years, just an entertaining historical romance novel that will bring a smile to face when you're in the mood to read a story with no other expectation than a happy ending."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"Very enjoyable. I read somewhere that Susannah (the heroine) was Robards's favorite."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"This was a very fast paced book that kept me on edge anticipating turning to the next page. One of the things I liked most about this story was that Susannah was not the typical beauty that you find in most books. I read this book in one night and have passed it on to several friends and sisters who loved it just as I did."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"Nobody's Angel is the story of a prim, eldest daughter of a preacher who is a mother figure to her three sisters who falls in love with a wrongfully convicted Marquis who is sold to her as an indentured servant. I don't think that I could have read the words &quot;prim&quot; and &quot;mother-figure&quot; any more times than I did in the first half of the book. Unfortunately, there is no chemistry between the characters - they are fairly boring and uninteresting. I think an important facet to romance novels is that you should fall in love with the characters as you read - that isn't possible with Susannah or Ian or the Redmond family. Robards attempts to establish the 4 sisters as a &quot;Little Women&quot; group but fails. They have none of the charm of Alcott's characters. The writing and dialogue is mediocre at best. Don't waste your time on this book...I realized that pretty early on but I read up until 3/4 of the book before I realized that it couldn't be redemmed and then just skimmed through to get to the predictably unsatisfactory end. Pick up a McNaught or Brandewyne novel instead."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"Karen Robards is one of my favorites. Her more recent book, &quot;Dark Torment&quot;, is extremely similar to &quot;Nobody's Angel&quot;, and surpasses it in character development, plot and tension.&quot;Dark Torment&quot; is the much better version, and I recommend you skip &quot;Nobody's Angel&quot; and go to the real thing.Suzannah's and Ian's relationship seemed slow, and there wasn't much tension (until the end on the ship).There was continuous reference to Suzannah's religious beliefs, but she fell into bed with Ian with almost no urging. Not too believable and overly hypocritical.I feel the end was also anti-climactic, and felt that Robards had included too many unnecessary secondary characters. They just got in the way.My advice read &quot;Dark Torment&quot;."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"This book was amazing after the first initial chapters. I drug myself throught the first 5 chapters. It starts out really boring and i wonder why my best friend is telling me to read it. Then, out of the blue, they're going at it like crazy! It's pretty steamy when it gets to the \\"intimate\\" parts. I completely recomend this one! Eventually you will feel like you are Suzanna and Ian has just swept you off of your feet. It's pretty good stuff!P.S. This girl gets FREAKY!!"},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"This is a story that is a bit different than the normal boy gets the girl.

Well she gets more than she has bargened for (in the love dept.) and less in the farming department (he was a Marquis in England) thought I didn't understand all of the timing of the book.

To help ease her workload, she decides to purchase a &quot;bound man.&quot; She recklessly purchases Ian Connelly,a convict who has been badly beaten. While restoring him back to health, she develops an instant attraction to this stranger who is surprisingly well educated and very handsome. Ian has a secret past and identity, and this past is still trying to hunt him down. He works diligently to prove himself to Susannah, but she has difficulty pushing aside his status as her &quot;bound&quot; servant. The romance that develops between these two characters is so sweet and strong, that you will not be able to sert the book down until you've finished.

I got lucky and this book fell into my hands a second time :) hehehe. In a short summary, a spinster that is busy taking care of her father and 3 sisters decides to buy a slave. The thing I don't get is that ...her father is a priest. This somehow contradicts itself, yet it works. Surprisingly, the man only stays around to get under her skirt. He turns out to be a marquis and she catches him 'sneaking' away. The sex is incredible, the guy is incredible, but he is an idiot she always seems to forgive. Ehh?!This book has it's funny parts..when he is trying to collect eggs from the chicken coop and comes out with feathers stuck to him and killer chickens after him. Her sisters always bickering..kinda reminds me of my family. :) Come on give it a try, you know you want to . and besides it's a good one."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"This book is about a household of daughters of a Baptist minister run by the eldest, spinster daughter, since their father's mind usually occupied with church things. To ease the physical burden of running a farm, she purchased a bond servant who turned out to be a English aristocrat betrayed to be killed but ended up being sold instead.What do you get when you have a man born and bred to be a duke put into a position of being a bond servant? What do you get when you have a authoritarian, bossy spinster lady who is use to being in charge of everything and everyone challenged by a former marquise? The dynamics between the two was hilarious. I enjoyed Ian being Ian, who sleeps buck naked, who exudes arrogance and sexuality, who makes you want to wack him with a bag of beans at times for his gall, and who makes you applaud him when he is able to see inner and hidden beauty in someone who was truly beautiful all around.I enjoyed Suzanna too, who has the burden of a large family, farm and community on her shoulders, but accepts her station in life without complaint. She is one of those people who is truly selfless and giving, and trying with every ounce of her being to be \\"good.\\" Which was why I understood her comflict when she falls in love with Ian and makes love with him, then struggled with the guilt. I also loved it when she discovered against her preconceived notion of herself, that she could be physically beautiful with the right clothes and hair-do.This was a fun story, very sexy, and full of surprises. However, the ending felt rushed. I would have liked to see Susanna strut her inner strength and duchess-like demeanor at Ian's side at the ton while they were in London. I would have liked to see Ian get more satisfaction than the two pages, when he revealed his mother's evil plot. It would have been nice to have more words devoted to Ian and Suzanna's final reunion, and maybe an epilogue about their life as a married couple."},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, as I love heroines who are plain, serious, on the shelf, and all that good stuff, lol. Susannah definitely delivers on that end, but she's also *much* more: she's strong, generous, intelligent, and all-around lovely. She is essentially the head of her household, taking care of her three younger sisters and her absentminded father, who is a reverend. Susannah has held this caretaker role since she was 14 and her mother died. While she is at times content, she is never truly happy, and has given up on the idea that she might have a family and home of her own someday.Her pairing with Ian Connelly (also the Marquis of Derne, though she doesn't know it) was absolutely perfect. He was a \\"bad boy\\" in his previous life (read: rake/rogue) and is truly considered one now, having been (wrongly) convicted of attempted murder and sent to America to serve a term of indentured servitude. While this book was written awhile ago, Ian is not an 80s-throwback hero, of which I was very relieved. He's an alpha male-type definitely, but I liked that he *does* work the farm and wants to learn how to help the family. He's a marquis, has no experience with physical labor, and was pretty much a wenching wastrel before all of this happened, yet he doesn't act spoiled or condescending.The exchanges between Ian and Susannah were very sweet; I so enjoyed watching him tease her and seeing Susannah lighten up a little and allow herself to enjoy things. They are very much opposites, but fit together perfectly. The first half of the book was great, because we get to see their relationship develop through this odd-prism of Susannah thinking Ian is an indentured servant she bought (and ex-servant) and a man she's falling in love with, and Ian beginning to realize that Susannah is so much more than she shows the world and that all the other beautiful (but spiteful and greedy) women he's known pale in comparison to her.CRITICISMS:The second half is where things decidedly went downhill for me. I don't want to give anything away regarding the plot, so I will just say the following:-- What could have been an emotional and lovely reunion was not.-- Susannah has a decidedly shrewish period, one that is somewhat understandably, but a little over the top.-- The entire subplot of how Ian was betrayed and forced into indentured servitude is resolved completely \\"off-screen\\" (off-page?) and is unbelievably anti-climactic - twice-over.-- Parts of the subplot seem to come out of nowhere and involve people we've never met before or even been told about.-- For most of the second half, the romantic relationship between Susannah and Ian is very different from what it was before - and not in a good way. It felt very seedy and far more superficial - and mostly physical - than it had before. Also, their personalities seem very changed, though I'm not sure whether that was what contributed to the seediness-feeling or vice versa.-- The ending was a little anti-climactic and I feel that more should have been resolved between them, both emotionally and practically/logistically.I also did not like the fact that almost all of the book was told from Susannah's POV. It made me feel very blind as to what was going on emotionally and internally with Ian, and I would have liked more insight into his feelings and thoughts.Two other minor complaints: Whatever happened with Jed, the wife-beater? And Susannah's sister Mandy was very, very annoying.BOTTOM LINE:While this book could have easily been turned into a 4.5 or maybe even 5 star read for me, several things in the second half of the book decidedly lowered my opinion. I'm glad that I read the book and would recommend it, however I'm also happy that I got it from the library and did not buy my own copy.RECOMMENDATIONS:In many ways, this book reminded me of Lorraine Heath's series Rogues in Texas, which revolves around three English \\"gentlemen\\" who are all sent by their families to America \\"for their own good.\\" They are best friends: one is a duke's bastard, another an aimless and direction-less second son, and the third a gambling addict.Book 1 -A Rogue in Texas(4 stars)Book 2 -Never Love a Cowboy(4 stars)Book 3 -Never Marry a Cowboy(unread)"},{"Title":"Nobody's Angel (Book Club Edition)","review":"Karen Robards did a good job of telling her story about a family in the deep south in 1769. Most of us have little knowledge of the everyday life during that time so Robards did a good job of researching her subject. Religion plays a big part in the family life of a southern preacher--her father. His four daughters are who the story centers around. Susannah is the key person who shows southern hospitality and sweet innocence in the matter of the heart. The scene is ripe for her to be swept off her feet by a young dashing--reprobate. Robards spins her yarn telling how these two opposites' paths cross and love blossoms. This was a quick and interesting read. It has a wonderful twist on the prince charming subject. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about southern comfort, history, sibling rivalry and the rags to riches theme.--- Beverly C.

What made it for me, though, was the humor, which was fantastic.The beginning, with Susannah buying Ian as a slave was interesting (annoying, the way she tried to lead him around on a leash, but she became nice pretty quick). I found it irritating how she wouldn't believe a word out of his mouth. In fact, I hated Susannah. I liked Ian a lot though, and wished he would have had the sense to dump her and get with someone actually worthy of him. She insulted him at nearly every turn, and was basically awful and beyond snappish, but she didn't become this way until the end--she got progressively meaner and more idiotic.The middle of the novel, with Ian learning how to work on a farm was funny and endearing.

Furthermore, her fear-based, negative attitude is astounding to me. Why she has chosen to write a book on twins is beyond me as she clearly has issues with the subject! Of the dozens of books that have been gifted to me, this is the first one that I feel needs to be removed from my house.A great book on twins that I've thoroughly enjoyed is \\"Ready or Not Here We Come!\\".

She doesn't bother with presenting facts or even trying to offer a balanced view since her very strong, albeit bizarre opinions should obviously suffice. The so-called \\"research\\" she does quote is generally outdated, invalidated by other numerous, much more respectable studies and generally presented in a way that's so biased; it would be considered completely unethical by standards of any medical or research profession. Although some of her claims are so outrageous, they could be amusing (i.e. - make sure to talk to your twins about their in-utero memories); her paranoid distrust of the medical establishment, her misinformed nutritional advice and pretty much everything else in her book will only produce outrage at best and needless guilt and fear at worst in any woman still able to think for herself despite being pregnant."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"FROM: An Obstetrician who loved the book!Reviewer: Robert J. Oliver, MD, PhD, FACOG: Having Twins and more.Houghton Miffin, Publisher ISBN 0-618-18373-0I have just completed a review of the finest book on multiple births that I have seen and I have seen a lot of them in my 43 years of obstetrics practice. Frankly, I am upset that my profession did not write this book for my benefit and that of my many mothers who made it through pregnancy with more than one child at a time. I compliment those mothers for I have used just exactly what Elizabeth Noble wrote about and have never had to do a section for twins and none of my mothers have ever had preterm births in all my practice years. Because of what I did, no; the mothers did what the book emphasizes, become knowledgeable and be responsible for your births.Ms Noble has provided an informed consent book for the mother who must put up with the scare techniques we doctors have been taught so that we can manipulate women into believing they are not capable of safe and secure, full term, unassisted twin or more childbirth. The text is easy to read, there is a good glossary for terms which might confuse, and a most important section or two covers the problems of twin birth, loss of one twin, and psychological issues of loss felt by the surviving twin. I was most happy that she included a reasonable criticism of assisted reproductive technology (the name implies the issue) and the terrible results of male circumcision, condemned by the thoughtful parent.I would love to have seen more information that would help parents understand what prenatal testing really is about and the trauma that the fetus will experience. Unfortunately, most of the statistics about interventions, VBACs, epidural and elective induction and cesarean section have changed. Instead of lower rates of cesareans, epidural and inductions these interventions which cause increased birth trauma have increased dramatically and especially so for twins. Epidurals are used in 75-90% of all births, and VBACs are now banned in most hospitals for no good reason.Everyone who is faced with the birth of multiples would do well to study this book.

This book is the LEAST of all three. The author is overly opinionated, uses scare tactics and everything I was looking for WAS NOT found in this book.If you believe that formula will kill your baby, that circumcision is mutiliation that your child will never forgive you for, and that if you don't attachment parent your child, it will grow to be unemotional or emotionally retarted, then this book is for you.If you are looking for science and information to help you get through your pregnancy, look at another book. I am TAKING THIS BOOK BACK!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I must say that I'm surprised by the many bad reviews here. I read the book when I thought I might be having twins, and have recently re-read it as part of my doula training, and I found it to be very informative. There is a lot of research out there to back up many of her \\"opinions\\" about natural birth, home birth, etc. A good book that lists many of the studies is \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth\\", by Henci Goer. You don't need to be a Dr. to be able to understand the research that has been done. I found this book helpful, as I hated the thought that I might be required to have a cesearen simply because I was carrying twins. There are many things we can do to try and assure that we have a healthy pregnancy and baby, but that does not mean that we are required to do so.I think it's interesting that many of the positive reviews come from medical professionals or people in other countries, where birth is not seen as a medical emergency in most situations.I hope that those who are seeking to be an active participant of their child's birth will read this.This book is not for those who want to naively believe that everything an OB says is the only way to have a healthy baby. The vast majority of pregnancies do not require the special training of the OB, and unneccessary medical interferance with the birth process does more harm than good. (Again, their have been studies to support this statement. See the above mentioned book)."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I really like this book, no matter how controversial it may seems at times.

It is very anti-doctors, and scares you more than helps you.

My wife started to read this book and within hours she put it down and was extremely upset. Please do NOT waste your money on this thing!!! Elizabeth Noble goes on and on about each and every horrible thing that can happen with a multiple pregnancy. She also says whatever possible to make the average reader feel extremely guilty for basically everything (i.e. consuming dairy, considering circumcision, using fertility treatments, going to a MD for care instead of a midwife, requesting pain meds during labor, eating produce from a \\"regular\\" grocery store-not the whole foods market..and the list goes on.) It is blatently obvious that she has NEVER been pregnant with multiples and probably has had very limited interaction with women who do have multiples. Do yourself a favor and read through the reviws on this book. I should have known something was up when she actually makes reference to the bad reviews on Amazon.com in the actual book!!!Take a look at the \\"good\\" reviews and you will see that the majority of them come from \\"clinicians\\" and individuals who appear to not have children!! How do they know how great the advice is if they don't even have twins??? It looks like she had some of her pals type up good reviews because the actual purchasers of this book were slamming it! Save your money and get a pack of diapers instead. You'll need the extra if you really are having multiples!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago always gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Noble provides a wealth of information about good nutrition, birthing practices, and the risks of multiple pregnancy. The problem is that the factual evidence is smothered in a heavy handed, one-sided viewpoint that seems to originate from the fascist regime of down-with-all-modern-medicine. This is my second pregnancy, and I recently found out that I'm carrying twins. I was interested in the possibility of a vagnial birth with minimal intervention, but I'm more shaken than encouraged by Noble's stance on the evils of c-sections and other possible complications. This book was NOT the one I needed to help me discern what was best in the upcoming months.The nutrition information had a solid core, but Noble pushed the envelope with her own agenda of anti-dairy pro-vegan diets. This would have been much better received and better understood had it less of a screaming banshee tone.Good luck, and you might want to find a different book."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst book on twins I have ever read! I would have saved myself a lot of tears and a week of depression had I heeded the warnings in these reviews.Frankly, I wonder if the reviewers who gave this book a positive review were reading the same book. It is so negative and pessimistic, I felt like Noble was trying to convince me that something would inevitibly go wrong and when it did, it would certainly be my fault. Not the kind of message you need when you are already in an emotional pregnant state of mind!Do yourself a favor and DO NOT read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This book contains many fascinating facts about twin conception, twin birth, being a twin, twin loss, and I think it does good job presenting an alternative point of view for women who WANT a non-medicalized pregnancy and birth. I read this book as a doula and mother of 4 children (no twins that I am aware of) and I have learned a lot. I think the author does a very good job exploring the psychological aspects of being pregnant with twins, preparing for twins, being a twin and all that these things entail. I think it's an emotional preparation for mothering twins as well as a practical one.Contrary to some reviewer's opinions I think the author seeks to calm the fears surrounding multiple birth and most importantly provides the most basic of ways to protect your pregnancy: good nutrition. I do think she has overlapping information but perhaps that is so the reader can read one chapter at a time, out of order and still get the information. There are some slightly confusing statements, but some decisions around carrying more than 1 baby are confusing, the author provides both points of view. Understanding the risks and benefits of procedures is very important before consenting to anything... the author does explain them. I do think that some of these procedures ARE scary so if a mother feels frightened that's better than going into them believing the procedures are innocent and can cause no harm and finding out the hard way.The author has done extensive research into the body of information available at the time of writing ( my copy is 2003). Some things in obstetric practices have changed but not a lot. I did not find it helpful to hear about maternity practices in other countries.... but perhaps this book is intended for international readers... it does help you realize how deplorable the state of maternity support is in our American culture. The author's chapter on circumcision is unflinchingly negative and will be an eye opener for families who think it is par for the course for boys and absolutely safe.I do not believe this book tells mothers to birth at home, avoid medical evaluation, say no to medical tests or treatments or take risks with their health or that of their unborn children. Rather, she suggests seeking a health care provider that supports your views about birth and she suggests that you educate yourself about birth practices. Some of her suggestions are not available in all parts of the US but are stated as if they are. I do like it that she has resources listed throughout the text as well as in the back. She also has a strong stance on and concrete ways of getting a lot of support after the babies come home. I cannot think of an area she does not cover that I would wonder about if I were carrying twins or more, conceived naturally or via the medical wonders of the modern age.This book will not be for everyone but I think parts of it can be for anyone. Much more good than bad."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"While this book does provide some valuable information, it seems to me that the author can't resist throwing in a lot of opinion and judgment under the guise of fact. Her off the wall blanket statements can be quite offensive and detract from the points in the book that look as though they might otherwise have been useful. With every Say \\"NO!\\" to dairy, stop the mutilation of our boys through circumcision, or the doctors are ruining your pregnancy- I lost more faith in this author. I wish that I had chosen another book or read the reviews before I purchased this one."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Unless you live in a hippie commune I suggest you skip over the sections on nutrition during pregnancy and birth and labor. Miss. Noble seems to assume that everyone reading the book is a Vegan, and that everyone wants a completely natural no-interference home birth. She gives completely random \\"instances\\" where women have given birth to say quadruplets at home in 1938 Germany, and they did fine so you should to. She neglects to give the statistics on, say, the amount of home births that have gone drastically wrong. She advocates the uses of midwives with multiple pregnancy and even referred to current medicine as \\"wizardry\\". She is highly against circumsion and gave extreme instances like some Canadian boy whose penis fell off. The information on carrying multiples and conceiving multiples is interesting, but most of it is preachy and one-sided. Some advice for Miss. Noble (who claims to be presenting all the facts in her introduction)- Why don't you display all the facts and not the ones that support your extremist views on multiple births and pregnancy. This should be an informative book that shows all sides of the issues. I will continue to go to my OB/GYN and drink my morning class of milk, and yes I am getting my son circumsized."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"The best advice I ever heard while pregnant was to let go of some \\"ideal\\" vision of my upcoming birthing experience because all that truly matters in the end is that mom and baby, or in my case babies(twin girls), are healthy. I started out my pregancy working with midwives and planned to have a water birth. When I found out we were having twins the plan began to change a bit. We still hoped for a vaginal birth but knew that all of the hospitals in our area preferred to do multiple deliveries in the surgical suite - just in case of a complication, so out went the water birth option. The night my water broke I was 36 weeks along and the girls had been estimated to weigh somewhere between 6 and 7 lbs so all seemed really good. One of the baby's was head down and in position but the other had turned into a breech position a few weeks back. We thought we could go ahead and deliver the first one naturally and then perhaps the second would turn. Our doctor was not on duty that night so the attending physician called to tell us he was going to have to do a caesarean. We questioned why and instead of explaining anything he said that is the only way he would deliver and he would transfer us somewhere else if we didn't agree. We knew we weren't going anywhere so we held our ground. The nursing staff was awesome and so supportive. Finally one of my doctor's partners was called in and came to see us. He took the time to check the sonogram and explained that there was a high risk when delivering the second baby breech. He explained what \\"could\\" happen and then left us to talk and make a decision. In the end I knew I hadn't carried these two healthy baby girls to risk anything happening to one of them due to a complication with a breech delivery, so we went ahead with the caesarean. Was that my first choice - absolutely not, was it the vision I had in the beginning, not even close, but we remained open and flexible and were intelligent enough to know that \\"one way\\" does not apply to all situations. We went home three days later with two beautiful baby girls. They were breastfed and bottlefed because I never could produce enough milk for them, again I had to be flexible. Breatfeeding wasn't easy at first and we relied on numerous visits to lactation specialists. I'm happy I've hung in there and the girls are still partially breastfeeding at over 7 months old. Yet, breastfeeding just isn't for everybody and they shouldn't be judged for it. A friend of mine had her son a month after me and his teeth came in early and he was biting her so hard that she had to wean him at 4 months and all the true and tried techniques to get him to stop didn't work. Again sometimes the \\"vision\\" doesn't match up with reality! Don't even get me started on home schooling! My husband is a fabulous middle school science teacher and 6th grade history teacher. I guarantee you that many parents are not qualified to teach all subjects to their children. In our area we have found that many home schooled children are being kept home by parents who have conservative religious views and are wanting to \\"protect\\" their children from other beliefs. I am shocked at parents who have taken issue with their children learning about different cultures in a world history class in 6th grade. This book reflects a narrow opinion. There are a lot of better books out there for parents of multiples."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Elizabeth Noble hasn't just &quot;updated&quot; her classic book but has completely revised it so it is up to date and an indispensible resource for families welcoming more than one baby.

Robert Oliver, MD, PhD"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Thanks to Elizabeth Noble for the updated version of her informative book. She provides much-needed facts about a number of issues that need to be addressed. As an obstetrical unit nurse, I saw horrific things happen to mothers and babies in a setting that I thought should be respectful of the mother and infant, where I thought mother and baby would be protected. I was sadly mistaken. While it is not easy to learn about the horrors of what goes on behind closed hospital doors, it is crucial if parents are to make truly informed choices. Only fear-based parents -- those who want to bury their heads in the sand and pretend awful things don't happen in the hospital -- will want to deny the important information offered in Having Twins and More. I found the material on the importance of maternal/infant bonding, unnecessary medical procedures (episiotomy and more), and the pain, trauma, and lifelong consequences inflicted on an unconsenting male by unnecessary non-therapeutic amputation of a part of male genitalia (euphemistically called circumcision) to be especially important, and I applaud Elizabeth Noble's willingness to tackle sensitive, even taboo, subjects to bring them into the light and expose them for what they are -- most often unnecessary medical intervention. This is no easy feat when challenging the dominant paradigm, the status quo, and the current medical model.Having Twins and More, with it's healthy approach to the normal birth process and promotion of minimal intervention, is an important book for parents and health-care professionals alike!Marilyn Fayre Milos, RN, Executive DirectorNational Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers, San Anselmo, California"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"As a &quot;natural&quot; mother and twin, I was immediately drawn to Elizabeth Noble's book Having Twins and More.

Naturally I had many knew concerns and questions regarding this whole new set up as I had so many new issues to deal with. Having read &quot;What to Expect When Expecting&quot; and many other great books I picked up &quot;Having Twins&quot; and was excited to see what was happening inside of me and for answers to calm my nerves. Instead what I found was A book full of horror stories and negativity. This book did nothing to reasure me of my new situation but brought me to believe that my being pregnant with twins was almost a curse. I was so upset that my husband finally took my new reading material away from me. I've talked to other mothers of twins who have read this book and have found much of the same reaction from all. I finally took back this horrible book and talked to the manager, who will no longer be selling it in her stores. Had she not been so kind to refund me my money I would have been just as glad to have left the book on the counter and walked away. Thank you for making my first few days as a parent of twins devastating.

I would love to have been able to have used a midwife for my pregancy, for instance, but it's probably unsafe for multiple pregnancies. As for what she believes about &quot;excessive&quot; ultrasounds, the benefits for multiples outweigh the risks. It wasn't till my 7th ultrasound that my babies were diagnosed with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (it didn't develop till then), and they would have died if I'd been more skeptical about the benefits of ultrasound. However, there are a whole lot of good things in this book. I read it straight through, and did feel very good about the possibility of a &quot;normal&quot; delivery, breastfeeding, and so forth, when others were criticizing (not my doctor) my hopes of doing so. The nutrition section also made me feel good, since it teaches women to not be afraid of gaining weight with multiples. Also, something that stuck out to me were the stories of prenatal recovered memories of twins. It probably gets filed in the &quot;too weird to be true&quot; box, but it was really interesting to read.Overall, this wasn't a great buy, but not a total bust, either.

Living in a world that views even a single pregnancy as \\"risky\\", I find that many women carrying twins often accept a cesarean birth without being fully informed on the possibility that a vaginal birth may not only be achievable but may be safer for her babies. This book is very informative on every aspect from \\"building\\" twins (& more), to birthing them, to parenting them. I find it well rounded and not \\"anti-medical\\" at all. Even though most literature and propaganda these days surrounding birth is so \\"anti-normal\\" it still catches me off guard when women respond so negatively to the idea that their body can actually birth a baby with little or no medical intervention.... even twins. The chapters on breastfeeding and parenting are also very informational, reassuring, and encouraging."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This is the worst baby book I have ever read. If you are a vegan, who doesn't believe in having ultrasounds, worries about the repressed memories of your babies during their embryo implantation in your womb, who plans to deliver her multiples totally naturally at home you might like this book. Otherwise, this is the beginning of the guilt you will feel.Ms. Noble also thinks you will cause your child pyschological damage if you have him circumcised. She is against the consumption of cow's milk by anyone (even kids and expecting moms)except cows. She doesn't even acknowledge the option of bottle feeding.As a omnivorous Jew who due to health reasons cannot breast feed I can only say that this is a book designed to make everyone like me feel extremely guilty. Of course, you too can feel guilty if you are not planning to have a completely natural birth experience- preferably at home.I can't remember throwing out a book before, but this one is too awful to donate to the library.

So many one-sided opinions and views expressed by the author that you can't distinguish what is factual. The pages on circumcision were a joke (I had to look at the copyright date b/c I thought it must be from the 1950's).

The first sign something was wrong is in the introduction of the book. The author has a degree in Physical Therapy, and how that makes her qualified to write on the subject of Twins is beyond me. She uses her personal opinions on the subjects of circumcision, cesarean section, nutrition and ultrasound examinations to make the reader believe these things are bad and even harmful. I am a clinical nutritionist in a pediatric hospital and I found her stance on &quot;no dairy products, as they cause disease&quot;, just plainunfounded and misinformed. It is scary to arm people in a very exciting time in their lives with the wrong information. The fact that she wants all twin mothers to strive for a natural birth is great, but not wholly realistic.

I cannot afford to shop at Whole Foods although I would LOVE to. I like to drink milk and plan to continue to do so. I happen to think that eating meat is probably the best way to get protein. I like cheese and have even discovered that in fact I CAN eat soft cheese (thank god because I'm a cheese nut) as long as the milk that it's made from is pasteurized. I work my butt off at my job and love every second of it and will find a way to continue to do so after these babies are born.Most importantly, my husband and I already love these babies more than anything and we are constantly in search of the \\"right\\" thing to do to help them get into this world. Reading Elizabeth Noble's book kept me up with guilt the night I got to the part about nutrition. I worried that my choices might hurt the babies I've waited so long for. I skimmed through other parts of the book and just could not take anymore. I wish wish wish I'd read reviews before buying this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Poorly organized and out of sequence. Author makes strange suggestions such as put your children in a box or drawer if you dont have a bassinet. Discurrages circumcision. Negatively writes about invetro... what century is the writer in???"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I am a Certified Nurse-Midwife with 25 years of practice. Having cared for numerous mothers of twins and delivered several sets at home, I feel that Elizabeth and Leo's book is acurate and empowering to any parent of multiples. This lays out the reality of birthing and caring for multiples. The choice remains in the parents hands when they are informed. This book gives you the information needed to make informed decisions about every aspect of the pregnancy and births. I encourage all parents of a multiple pregnancy to stay well informed and make the decisions that they know are right for their babies. This book will give you the knowledge and the power to follow your intuition and heart in making those decisions."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"As an expectant mother of twins looking for information about my pregnancy and the lives inside of me -- this book was so horrible. Instead of solid facts you get selective study results and opinions stated as fact. The book is downright biased to a totally holistic approach, and the author preaches a lot of psychobabble while bashing modern medicine. The book also incites that any way other than what the author advocates will somehow scar your kids for life. It's unnerving and I can see why a lot of people are upset after reading this.The author is clearly against anyone ingesting cow's milk yet the latest studies show that high-fat dairy products may help some females conceive. In the Journal of Reproductive Medicine (May 2006 issue), Gary Steinman, MD, PhD, of the Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center found that women who consume animal products, specifically dairy, are five times more likely to have twins. You aren't going to find facts like that in this slanted book.Selectively biased data + many opinions I disagree with = complete waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I mistakenly bought this book without reading any reviews and only reading a couple blips in the book store before buying this for my wife as we are expecting twins. As she started reading it, she pointed out sections to me and I was waiting for the counterpoints, and information supporting her views, but they never came. The book says it gives factual information to help parents make informed decisions, but it is far from it. This book is more of an opinion editorial with weak evidence and so much personal bias it's hard to believe any part of the book even if it may contain some factual information.I'm very disappointed that the book's cover and description are so misleading. This is not a resource book and should be placed in the fiction section of the book store, not resource. As a member of the healthcare profession, we are taught to look at all scientific based evidence to make an informed decision and also to sort out the information that is one-sided and biased. This book is on of those one-sided biased sources that should be tossed aside."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I have to disagree with the negative reviews. I am 21 weeks along with twins and bought the book around my 8th or 9th week. I found the book to be empowering as a women who is pregnant. To be reminded that my body will know what to do and that women have been birthing multiples for many eons successfully was a great message and comforting to me. Just because the author has also pointed out the good and the bad that goes along with childbearing is just reality. I was shocked that when I brought up the question of a vaginal birth at my OB's office I was looked at like I had 2 heads. C-sections are wonderful alternatives if there are problems but to be denied the chance to try makes me feel cheated and not looked at as an individual. I also love how the book empowers you to breastfeed the babies, however difficult it might seem in the beginning and gives you ways to be successful (like having others do as much for you as possible, getting plenty of fluids and good nutrition). Elizabeth Noble gives you the information and tools to make it possible. The nutrition chapters were very informative and helpful. I do believe that all of us have to be reminded that good nutrition and staying hydrated is a plus for anyone but most especially for pregnant women. I actually found the book to not be so alarmist like many of the other pregnancy books out there. Thank you Elizabeth for giving women their power back over their bodies and to let them make informed decisions based on their needs and wishes. It's helped me maintain a sense of calm over what to expect and I look forward to an enjoyable birthing experience and motherhood of twins knowing I have the tools to be successful."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I've read many reviews of this book several of them negative. While I will concede that some of the book is based on the authors opinion, ie homeschooling. Much of the book is based in fact. Many are offended at Nobles portrayal of circumcision and yet consider is female circumcision a common practice in the US? Why not? If your child is born with any other part of his anatomy different from his father will you have it surgically altered?Noble encourages us to do our own research, and be our own advocates. America ranks 30th in neonatal mortality rates, that means 29 other countries have fewer babies die before they are 30 days old. Why isn't our masterful technology putting us at #1?While technology can be lifesaving and is useful it can also be grossly overused.Countries that have the lowest neonatal mortality rates generally have midwifery care as the model even for twin births. Clearly using all the technological intervention possible is not working well for the US in terms of live babies and low tech is working well for many other countries.The way medical community often treats pregnancy as a disease IS frightening as well as how women are often treated during labor and birth. As a doula, I've witnessed countless acts of \\"assault\\" to womens bodies without thier consent. The most frightening thing of all is that many women let these things happen to thier bodies and never consider they have a right to be treated differently.While Noble's book may have some frightening information it also holds some very important information for those bold enough to take responsibility for thier own pregnancy and birth experience. If you take charge and do your own research you'll see that much of the information while seemingly frightening actually holds much truth.Once you know what is true you can make choices that are right for you and your baby.As a childbirth educator I can tell you the that the thing most of my clients discover...Truth can be the most frightening thing of all sometimes."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I didn't buy this book to have someone try to foist her 1970's \\"let's have a water birth in the basement while baking home-made yogurt and and tie-dying our hand-woven cloth diapers\\" viewpoint on me. If I had wanted that, I could just find a chatroom online for such people.I eagerly bought this book thinking it would be a comprehensive, objective guide for me in my twin pregnancy. I have two advanced degrees and read a lot and this book is so thoroughly confusing--the author uses cutesy words that I couldn't find defined anywhere in the book.The most offensive thing about this book is its subjectivity on so many things: c-sections, circumcision, breastfeeding--it's either the author's way or its wrong. Who needs such a one-sided and guilt-inducing viewpoint? I had a fantastic experience with a c-section my first pregnancy and plan another one with my twins. I don't see the need for circumcision, but that's a personal choice, and the author dwells entirely on the negative and doesn't even consider the religious or cultural perspectives for the procedure. Honestly, who in her right mind would have a home water birth with multiples? Next time I know to read more reviews before buying."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"If you're looking for a nicely packaged sermon - you've found it. If you'd like to have someone tell you how to think, feel, reason, etc., Ms. Noble is game for that too. Unfortunately, I bought this new third edition book hoping to better educate myself about our upcoming twins. The advice ranges from judgemental to downright nasty. Some of the statistics are also FRIGHTENINGLY out of range from what I've read in recent studies. If you happen to have used any sort of assisted reproductive technology (from IVF to aspirin), make certain you don't read the introduction as it is particularly damning. I would say that the new addition has been updated in its political idealogy only, with little focus on improving the accuracy of the information."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Elizabeth Noble and Leo Sorger have provided an excellent resource book for parents. It is heartening to see health-care professionals take a strong stand in defense of the baby when, in modern obstetrics, the baby is often overlooked as a sentient being who will be affected by everything that it experiences during the perinatal and postnatal periods. I especially appreciated the honest discussion about circumcision, which I know threatens many parents. Anyone who stands up for the genital integrity rights of the baby takes a risk of being ridiculed or dismissed because they have had the courage to challenge the dominant paradigm, the status quo, and the current medical model. Not one national or international medical association in the world recommends circumcision, yet the two-billion-dollar-a-year circumcision industry persists in the USA because people are afraid to discuss this crucial human rights issue. Noble and Sorger clearly understand the importance of the primal period and how to optimally care for the newborn. Their priorities are in exactly the right place on every issue -- and they have the courage to take a stand!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"As a HypnoBirthing instuctor and childbirth educator, I think this is the best book out there for mom's expecting twins. I have read many books about having twins and most dwell on the risks and dangers of multiple birth. There are more risks involved in twin birth and a book would hardly be balanced if this were not mentioned. However this book is a positive statement to moms of muliples that they can have the natural vaginal birth they want in most cases. There are lots of stories of moms who have birthed naturally and successfully. There is much info about twins in general. This book gives moms hope that they can aviod cesarean birth most of the time. It tells when a cesarean is indicated and when it is not. A good thing to have if your doctor is induction or cesarean happy."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"As a nurse practitioner and pre-natal educator I have always found it difficult to find literature for parents without ambiguous or faulty or with faddish information not really suitable for young parents.There are no such problems with 'Twins and More'. Every aspect of preparation for birth and parenthood is covered with the expertise only a long-time wholistic practitioner can offer. It is, of course, suitable for parents of a single child also.I am particularly pleased with Elizabeth Noble's concern for respecting and preserving newborns' and older childrens' foreskins 'intact'. Prenatal educators have recently been named in litigation by young men angry over having been circumcised as infants, so I feel safe from this contemporary hazard to my reputation and nursing licence when recommending 'Twins and More' to young parents as their 'birthing bible'.Congrats to E. Noble for a foundational work.B. Maurene White R.N., Montreal, Quebec, Canada"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I am delighted to see a new edition of \\"Having Twins and More,\\" by Elizabeth Noble. Elizabeth's other books, \\"Essential Exercises for the Childbearing Year,\\" and \\"Childbirth With Insight\\" were required reading when I taught childbirth classes. \\"Having Twins\\" is the only book I can recommend to mothers expecting multiples. Other books gloss over the importance of nutrition and assume you will accept a high-risk pregnancy label and automatic cesarean without protest.Some of the other reviewers of this book complained that it frightened them and that the dietary information was not to their liking. I looked through the book carefully, but I could not find the source of their concern. On a hunch, I looked at the reviews for \\"What to Expect When You Are Expecting,\\" a book that I have always considered to be bland and overly deferential to obstetricians. Sure enough, many reviewers complained that this book frightened them and had impossible nutritional expectations. I had to laugh when I read that some folks actually thought that \\"What to Expect\\" undermined their doctor's authority!I guess there is a subset of moms who don't want to hear that what they eat every day is more important than anything their doctor can do to insure a healthy pregnancy and a safe birth. Nor do they want to know that there are controversies in obstetrics, the least scientific medical specialty. Like it or not, there are important choices that every mother must make about birth. Leaving everything up to a doctor is still a choice, but the doctor is not the one who will have to live with the consequences.\\"Having Twins and More\\" is the best book available for expectant parents of multiples, and the health professionals who work with them."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"parts of this book are ok, but I disagreed with a lot of it too- the book does not give an objective viewpoint on pregnancy & birth."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This author clearly has her opinions--and negative ones directed at the medical community. Admittedly, while this author probably knows more than I do about twins (I'm still pregnant with mine), I felt as if I were reading an editorial at times rather than an informative book about being pregnant with, having, and raising twins. She's against circumcisions. She's against C-sections. She thinks mothers should take their twins to the doctor's separately (what??), etc., etc.. There are some helpful notes in the margins which are from parents of twins, but some of them were worrisome rather than helpful (\\"I thought everything was fine and I lost one twin at 12 weeks...\\"). I just happened to buy this book because it was among the first I had seen. Perhaps it was not my wisest choice."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I pretty much agree with all the other negative reviews about this book so I won't restate everything, but this book was clearly written by someone who does not want to INFORM, but only to convince the reader to do things HER WAY. Basically, if you have a C-section, don't breast feed, or if you circumsize your child then you are a horrible person, according to the author. Also, I work in the Pediatric ICU and I can tell you that some things written in this book are not only false but could be dangerous to your child."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"The tone of this book comes off as preachy and guilt laden.

I was grateful to find a resource that talked about everything I could have questions about. My midwife recommended it to me and I have since given it to my mother-in-law so that she can also gain some comfort. Well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I just received this book today as a gift and I have been reading it for the past few hours. I am concerned with the way the author makes judgements about so many aspects of being pregnant with multiples and offers little/no advice for situations where her preferred method of doing something is not feasible. For example, It would be nice to go to the Whole Foods market every day for fresh organic produce but if you don't live near such a market or can't afford to spend so much on produce does that instantly mean your babies are going to be malformed or malnourished??I also have a hard time buying into the whole idea of asking my twins to relay their \\"in-utero\\" experiences to me after they are born. She even goes so far as to suggest that when one of the babies does not survive in-utero, the surviving twin is traumatized by the occurrence and will need to talk about it later in life!!! This is some strange form of psycho-babble that I don't need while I'm trying to prepare for the births of my first babies.Another strange suggestion in this book is that mothers of multiples are supposed to come up with two(or more) seperate names for their twins before birth so that they can begin to develop their sense of identity. Ummmm, what!!? How will they know who I'm referring to? I can't see inside myself and without the use of ultrasound (which she seems to despise) how will I know where they are??Ugh! This book is very frustrating. The advice sounds like it is comming frome someone who has NEVER been pregnant with multiples and has no clue how scary her \\"advice\\" sounds. I'm glad my friend gave me a gift receipt!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This is my first pregnancy and I am expecting twins, so I picked this book up because at first glance it seemed to have a lot of detailed information. Huge mistake. Natural childbirth and excellent nutrition during preganacy all sound like great ideas to me. However, this book is just absolutely rediculous. Instead of providing the reader with factual information from which one can make their own judgements and decisions, Noble shamelessly pushes her own agenda and tries to make the reader believe that what she says is medical fact. I ended up feeling that this book is really offensive. The chapter on c-sections is particularly horrible. It will make you think you're headed for the butcher's table and your bablies will be forever traumatized. But what really lost me was the section of home schooling. Noble suggests that you should home school your twins because literacy rates in the US were higher before compulsory schooling. She does allow, however, that schools provide convenient custodial care for those selfish mothers who would like to return to work. If that's not enough to make you see what a wacko this woman is, then you might actually enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"i feel compelled to write a review here of this unique book about multiple pregnancy and birth having only read a few of the scathing reviews it has received. this book was an inspiration to me during my twin pregnancy.i found this book to be refreshing among all of the other ones out there on the topic because unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I found it to be positive. Pick up any other book on the subject and there you will find true scare tactics. Noble says it's possible to have a twin birth in a more natural way and if you truly believe that, it will most likely be possible for you. I think she clearly explains potential risks and obviously there could potentially be a need for more aggressive tactics in any birth, but birth, even a multiple one, doesn't have to be so medicalized.Check out the inspiring stories on www.mothering.com in the multiples forum section for many, many positive stories about natural birth of twins. The more we are told by our care practitioners that our babies will be born early and most likely by cesarean, the more that will happen. law of attraction, anyone?my twins were born naturally at 40 weeks 3 days at 8 1/2 and 7 1/2 lbs."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Don't let the negative reviews stop you from reading this book. Hands down it is the BEST book out there for mothers expecting twins or more. Although most multiples are delivered by cesarean these days, Ms. Noble does address the concerns of mothers who desire a natural birth as well. There aren't many books out there that even acknowledge that a mother of multiples might consider a natural birth. I reread the birth stories again and again in the last weeks of my twin pregnancy. I also had my girls at home despite having had a previous cesarean.Some of the topics in this book may be more \\"alternative\\" or \\"AP\\" than many mainstream parents would care for... However, Ms. Noble's statements are backed by plenty of research and documentation to support her views. She balances it out by providing information for those mothers who might choose a more mainstream parenting approach as well.Read the book, cover to cover, and you will gain a wealth of information."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read about pregnancy, parenthood and multiple birth. The author seems to mistrust every healthcare professional, medical procedure and discourages common sense. With phrases like, \\"Circumsizing terrorizes, terrorism circumcises,\\" you can get your guilt trip without even leaving the house. Negative and disturbing."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"My husband and I have two children and just recently found out that we are expecting twins. I found that I wanted to read as much as I could on having multiples and so I began my research. After reading two wonderful books on having multiples I picked up Having Twins and More thinking it would give similar information and hopefully more that I didn't know. To say the least I was shocked and disgusted at Noble's one sided, fanatic stance on nearly everything I read. Some parts were down right funny (she says that if you have your sons circumcised you aren't taking the whole baby home)...until I realized that many women who were reading this book were pregnant for the first time and how horrific and shocking her views would be. Please do your homework before buying this piece of trash! I have had two high risk pregnancies and expect that this one will be as well. I use an OB, have ultrasounds, have formula fed my children (not by choice),drink milk, and have had both of my boys circumcised and I refuse to feel guilty about any of it!!!! In fact if you are in a high risk pregnancy the advise in this book borders on malpractice if given in the form of medical advise which is what Noble tries to to do. This book made it less than 24 hours in our house, thank God the book store refunded our money otherwise it would of been left in the hands of my 1 year old (he would of destroyed it in a matter of minutes)."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"There are several areas within this book which misrepresents published data - a concerning example of misinforming the public concerning areas in obstetrics which the authors obviously lack knowledge. The chapter on Prenatal Care and Screening Tests has inaccuate data on ultrasound and makes ultrasound seem unsafe. In fact, the reasons patients were having ultrasound exams in the first place were because they were having complications. The authors twist the data to make it sound as though the ultrasound caused the problems. Ultrasound equipment utilized in the USA has strict safety criteria to ensure safe use in fetuses. Too bad they forgot to describe how much perinatal care has advanced because of sonography.My patients find this book confuses them and misleading."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This book is all over the place. It is refreshing to read a guidebook that reflects a vast exploration beyond the prevailing myths about multiple births. I like Noble's free range genius that presents evidence based data, stories, ideas, and an invitation to think outside of fear (and the complicity it engenders in parents of twins and more). HAVING TWINS has courage. The author takes the reader to the primal core and by educating us, more babies can be gently welcomed with love rather than viewed as medical emergencies waiting to happen."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"As someone who recommends reading material to patients about many health-related subjects, I value most of all those who tell the whole story. I don't find it provokes anxiety - it's inspirational!! Ms. Noble fearlessly exposes the many myths about twin pregnancy, frankly portrays the joys and challenges of birthing and raising twins, and most importantly, puts the power of knowledge and compassionate choice directly into the hands of of current and future parents. My clinical experience tells me that the better informed people are, the better their clinical outcomes are, all around. So, if what you want is information that will empower you to make the best choices for you and your twins, devour this book! Your doctors may not thank you (you'll make them work harder), but one day your children will!!! And you'll feel better, too . . . I buy and gift a copy of this to any patient or friend I know who's expecting twins. My thanks to Ms. Noble for her caring candor!!"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Very excited at expecting twins. I bought this book. The very next day I wanted to return it. Although I am a mother who breastfeed my daughter for a year and a half , and used a sling more often than a carriage and am personally against circumcision, I found the author' opinions (and that's exactly what this book is full of) to be radically left wing and skewed. The chapter on Surviving Twins was promising to be an interesting read. And it was, but the parts where she describes what appears to be regression hypnosis of her patients to bring them back to an embryonic stage to deal with their vanishing twin was a bit far fetched for me. It all had a carnival charlatan feel to me.The chapter on nutrition was informative, but Noble's stance on diary is a bit extreme in my opinion as is her blatant promotion of a vegan diet. As an RN who has taken several nutrition courses, I was puzzled as to how Noble came to some of the conculsions she had. Although, I will say that her charts of vitamin, mineral and protein content of various foods was informative, I could've found that info in any basic nutrition book.Overall, this book was a disappointment to me. I bought it because I thought it would be an informative book full of advice and witty stories of twins...and it was, it was just advice I don't feel comfortable following."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Once again, Elizabeth Noble has brought a more &quot;normal&quot; attitude toward twin pregnancy and birth. As a childbirth educator and doula specializing in multiple birth, and as a mother of twins myself and also a mother who experienced very complicated pregnancies, it is always so encouraging to read Elizabeth's research and picture proof that multiple pregnancies aren't always chocked full of problems... and yet... there is so much information also given regarding all the &quot;what if's&quot; and explanations of what happens when those &quot;what if's&quot; do happen. Seeing all the updates that Elizabeth has made to her latest edition is also a testament to her ongoing research on the subject of multiple birth.I would continue to recommend this book to any mom/couple pregnant with twins. It's not necessary to read all chapters to get what you need from this commanding resource of information."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"So many parents today are so eager to place their baby in a vibrating device, prop them up with a bottle and go on that our society is often shocked to here suggestions from experts that are to the contrary. We must remember that ours is one of the few cultures which places babies in objects for self-entertainment, in seperate rooms for sleep and routinely chooses the big c for boys.I am a breastfeeding, co-sleeping mom of twins. Other books have suggested I feed formula to keep my sanity. How is waking up 50 times in the middle of the night to make bottle sanity? How is coping with the thousands of doctors visits which result from formula usage related illnesses (ie ear infections, constipation, and even lukemia) easier? Is it fair to sacrifice the health of my kids for what is convenient? Let's face it people, children are not for those who can't accept a little sacrifice! I am beginning a PhD program in maternal-infant bonds and the more I know about our cultural child-rearing practice the more I understand our materialism and the violence which plagues our society.If you want a compassionate, infant-centered look at having twins, this is it. If you want to hear that what you do will not affect the way your child turns out, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"A must buy!!! Great tips and advice for new parents of twins! I highly recommend this book to any new parents."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Don't be fooled. This book is full of feel good psudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, and rather short on good, scientifically backed information. It really is garbage, and I cannot see how it would be useful to anyone, nor would I want anyone who found it useful to be in charge of raising a baby, much less two. I cannot even count the number of useless paragraphs in this book, or the number of unsourced 'studies' that show one thing, but another unsourced study from a different country said that the other thing could be true, and ARGH! It's so bad my brain hurts... starting to get the picture?"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I can't recommend this book. I am an RN and would consider myself to be a pretty average American citizen in terms of lifestyle. Ms Noble is certainly not a fan of \\"western\\" medicine, and I am not sure she's much of a fan of the American way in general. So much time is spent applauding other countries for their practices and belittling those that are typical in the States. I just spent the better part of my afternoon off reading this book. Unfortunately, I procrastinated and now I am way past the 14 day return policy where I purchased it. Initially I found the introductory chapters on the more historical and scientific(genetic) aspects of twins very interesting. However, delving deeper into the book, I find it to be dated and all over the place in terms of organization. I found myself wondering how much editing or revision had taken place in the 30 years since its original publication. It seems as though the authors' concept of mother/father roles in parenting and family is very 1979. At the end of a passage where she bemoans the fact that some mothers will need to get back to work from a financial standpoint, she adds a link to her website from which she sells nutritional supplies, suggesting that these mothers could start selling vitamins and supplements she endorses on said website. In the same vein, she spends a great deal of time in criticizing the way in which the US handles maternity leave. She cites the generous paid leaves available in Sweden and Finland and Portugal. Wonderful if you live in one of those countries, but how does this knowledge help me?? I'm not going to move there prior to birth, so how is it relevant? If anything, it only made me feel anxious and guilty at the fact that I likely will be going back to work (as nearly ALL of my friends have) at the end of my apparently lousy 12 weeks off. I am not opposed to natural childbirth and whole foods, and I plan to have my twins share a crib, but the only real piece of helpful information I read today was that my twins will use approximately 100 diapers per week. Everything else just left me riddled with anxiety."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This book isn't for everyone. That said, as a naturally minded mother who had sought natural births, breastfed, coslept, and done attachment parenting with my older three children, I found almost every other twin book I picked up discouraging, disheartening, and negative. The message inherent in most of them was clear: you may have strong feelings about pregnancy, birth, and parenting, but you're having twins now so you lose the right to have an opinion. Those other books also worried me (wrongly) that all twin pregnancies are scary, that all twins are born early and by cesarean, and that it's too hard to breastfeed twins. These messages were not only emotionally traumatic for me, they are patently untrue and not supported by the research.When I was expecting twins, I consulted this book, but I also read hundreds of studies on pubmed. What I found was that Having Twins and More is consistently right when it references studies about pregnancy and birth. Although I could have done without some of the twin psychology bits, and I can see how someone who is pro-circumcision (I'm not) could be put-off by her clarity on circumcision as a painful and unnecessary violation of basic human rights, there is not a twin book out there that offers mothers a more realistic, helpful, and proactive view of twin pregnancy and birth. There are ways you can improve your chances of a positive outcome with your twin pregnancy-- she addresses them. Women are often scared unnecessarily into medical procedures and birth interventions for no reason other than because they are carrying twins, without medical necessity, without true informed consent. This book helps give mothers the information they need to avoid becoming yet another statistic of iatrogenic (physician-caused) prematurity, unnecessary cesarean, or breastfeeding relationship destroyed before it ever had a chance to begin. It is also the only twin book I've found that addresses the reality that twin births can happen safely in multiple birth environments (hospital, home, birth center), thus supporting birth choice.The bottom line: If you are currently against natural family living or attachment parenting, you will hate this book (and, apparently, go on to write scathing reviews of it on Amazon). If you are not already leaning toward natural family living or attachment parenting but have an open mind, you may or may not like this book, but might find parts of it useful anyway. If you are currently a natural family living, attachment parenting, pro-breastfeeding mama, this book is the only one you'll find that is made for mothers like you."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I continue to search the pages of this book for \\"guidance.\\" All I seem to find are very negative, very opinionated statements on what the author wants to convey are the ONLY ways that you can carry, birth and raise twins. The last thing a parent of multiples needs is reading that they've been doing it wrong. We are all one step away from insanity in those first months and surely want to read something more objective and encouraging. Don't waste your time getting depressed from reading this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I am a doula and I found this book to be poorly written and organized. It is badly in need of an editor. Ms. Noble's writing is confusing in some places, and seems lazy--she will make a statement but neglect to analyze it or explore it further.I am pro-breastfeeding and natural childbirth and I will not circumcise my children either, but I find the author's preaching to be abrasive and maddening. She does not offer evidence for both sides of an issue, only for her point of view. She is also inconsistent--she advises her readers to find out their babies' sexes, then goes on about the dangers of the very tests (ultrasound, amniocentesis) that allow parents to find out the sex before birth.While many women expecting multiples will have C-sections today, the chapter on C-sections is terrifying. I have been a doula for women having cesareans, and while they are not ideal, they are not the terrible thing this book makes them out to be. As a doula, it is my job to comfort women and it makes me angry to read a book that will no doubt put fear in anxiety into many of its readers. Ms. Noble should instead seek to reassure women that if they need a c-section, most likely they will be fine, as will their babies.After chastising the medical industry for having practices that are not based on scientific evidence of efficacy, Ms. Noble then launches into her pseudo-scientific beliefs, such as that each of has memories going back to conception, which may be unlocked during hypnosis. She criticizes those she disagrees with as unscientific, yet much of her book is unscientific drivel.Instead of writing a guide for all parents of multiples, regardless of their views on natural childbirth or circumcision, Ms. Noble has written an ideological creed about how she thinks one should birth and raise multiples."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I wish I had read the author's preface before buying this book. In it she states that people on Amazon gave her negative reviews for what she perceived to be her \\"lack of political correctness.\\"If only it were that.The author seems to have an odd vendetta against all current medical technology and she makes it abundantly clear in her writing. If you're looking for a neutral, well-informed presentation of facts, keep on going. Every topic she touches focuses on what she perceives is the ONLY way to do it, and everything else is either deemed scary or wrong in very alarmist tones. For example, your medically necessary Caesarian will wind up scarring your baby for life with post-birth nightmares. Instead, she would more likely than not tell you to immediately find another doctor, one who would allow you to have a home birth instead.My best friend homeschools, gave birth to all three of her children at home (one was a water birth) and is a consultant with La Leche, so I have a very broad view on alternative birth methods and parenting. So, while I consider myself open-minded and find myself aligned with the author's views on breastfeeding and nutrition, her condenscending tone and heavy handed pushing on even these topics makes it impossible for me to accept ANY of her advice.Nowhere in this volume does she even hint that some of the modern procedures might actually help SAVE your and your babies' lives.I truly wish I had not wasted my money on this book as it has done more to tick me off than to help me prepare for the birth of my twins. Instead I recommend \\"When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads\\". This book is where Ms. Noble got all her diet and hydration info from which it seems that most of the other reviewers here found useful. It's still a little heavy-handed but I find it 1,000 times less condescending / insulting to my intelligence than Ms. Noble's work."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"What I find most disturbing about the positive reviewers on here is when they say \\"women have been birthing babies for millions of years.\\" Yes, they did. And many of them died: the babies and the mothers. ESPECIALLY multiples. Thank God for the medical interventions that have raised the survival rates of both women in childbirth and of infants. I had an emergency c-section at 34 weeks, and without it both my babies and I would have died. I had preeclampsia, which turned into full-blown toxemia. I was carefully monitored throughout my pregnancy by my wonderful pair of obstetricians (who were perfectly content to let me deliver vaginally if my preeclampsia cooperated), along with the perinatologist who kept monthly tabs on my boys' development in case the preeclampsia that had started at 10 weeks suddenly became an imminent danger to all of us. I'm just lucky I was able to carry them as long as I did. If I'd tried for a homebirth, without medical supervision of any kind during my pregnancy, it would have been disastrous. This book tells you that high blood pressure is nothing to worry about - it's normal with twin pregnancies, she says, and to be expected and nothing to seek a doctor's help over. If I'd listened to the advice of Ms. Noble, I would have died and so would my children. And THAT is why I give this book one star (and would give it zero if I could). Her advice on many things is her own opinion, to which she is entitled, but on others she is handing out dangerous advice that is medically unsound and could endanger the lives of both you and your babies.This book is frightening, pedantic, abrasive, ill-informed, archaic, and dangerous. The small pieces of good information she does provide do not make up for the bad advice that may endanger you and your children, and the good is so badly packaged it's hard to see it. Consider buying one of the other books available for multiple pregnancy instead (I like Connie Agnew and Nancy Bowers). Yes, you don't HAVE to have a c-section when you have multiples. Yes, a multiple pregnancy doesn't necessarily mean a high-risk pregnancy. But it is a FACT that multiple pregnancies are more likely to be high-risk. Carrying multiple babies puts you at a higher risk of developing pregnancy complications, many of which are life-threatening to either you or your babies, or both. It's entirely possible you'll have a totally unremarkable pregnancy and deliver your twins and full-term, vaginally, like my best friend did with her girls. It's equally possible that you'll have complications: preeclampsia, preterm labor, a funneling cervix, gestational diabetes, IUGR, and the mo-mo specific twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. You don't have to be afraid of a multiple pregnancy and medical interventions, but you should be prepared and informed. This book will not help you in that."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I am pregnant with twins and I've read six books so far on pregnancy and this is the only book I've read that reads like an opinion column and not one based on any medical facts or published studies. Worse yet, the author presents her strong biases only and her views are not ones that are supported by the majority of OB/GYN doctors, including mine. Beyond the misinformation, I just did not enjoy this book at all and thought it was a big waste of money. Among other things, I was really offended by the author's preachy tone and lack of any factual support for her opinions on the evils of all milk and dairy products, circumcision, and C-sections for babies in the breech position. I did not learn a single thing from this book. There are so many other twin books out there and ALL of them are more helpful than this one."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"It's unfortunate that the author is unable to convey information in a manner that is less judgmental. I am six months pregnant with twins and was alternately incensed by her strong biases (against ART, for example), informed (who knew arugula had so much calcium?) and unnecessarily scared to tears (by the fright and helplessness I felt when reading her chapter about the NICU). In the end, what stayed with me most after reading this book was fear. I won't allow myself to read it any more.Ironically, the choices I make tend to align generally with many of her views (breastfeeding, decreasing medical interventions, declining to elect circumcision), but I find her tone to be strident and her presentation unduly inflammatory to those who don't share all her views. Like other reviewers, I have found many of her claims questionable, if for no other reason than her inability to temper obvious and overwhelming bias. When writing a book for a general lay audience who are at a vulnerable stage in their lives, it is incumbent on an author not to alarm them and to present facts as objectively as possible. Elizabeth Noble fails on both fronts.Upshot: A mixed bag, but not worth it."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book because it was the only one available on multiple pregnancies at the book store I was at. The book was really disappointing. Although I tend to agree with some of the authors \\"holistic and natural\\" views, there was little unbiased presentation of all the options. It was pretty anti-Csection, anti-formula, anti-circumcision, etc. I feel like a more helpful book would present all sides of an issue in an unbiased manner and then let the parents make the decision from there. I am not the kind of person to write a review on anything... but I just found this book so disappointing that I HAD to make sure that other people don't make the same mistake I made."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This is my third pregnancy and I\\"m pregnant with twins. Already having 2 healthy children has made me pretty confident with the whole pregnancy experience, however, I know nothing about a multiples pregnancy. So I wanted a book that explained the most common problems of a multiples pregnancy. I wanted to know what I should be focusing on and how I need to be taking care of myself. This was the wrong book to pick.What I didn't need to read in my hormonal state was stories about rare complications like hemorrhaging (she tells the story of a mother who in 1904 suffered 2 severe postpartum hemorrhages). I also didn't need poor advice that contradicts my doctors' recommendations for lots of rest, \\"Carrying twins means making a double effort to stay in shape.\\" (pg.214). Or my favorite story about a midwife telling a mother pregnant with triplets that she didn't need a lot of obstetric technology or a c-section. (pg. 265) I certainly didn't need judgmental chapters about how circumcision is mutilation or \\"You will remember your birth experience forever; so will your babies. You want them to enter the world spontaneously (versus having a c-section).\\" And although I agree that breast is best (because I BF my first 2 children), I know that it isn't always possible- especially with multiples who are in the NICU. Rather than encouraging a mother to make the best decision possible based on all the facts and possible options, the author spends 15 pages pushing why breast is best and 3 pages on the the dangers of bottle feeding. Unbelievable.I didn't need the author's personal agenda. I really just wanted the facts so that I can make decisions about what is best for me and my family. I found what I was looking for in the book, \\"When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads\\" by Dr. Barbara Luke. This book has been very informative and objective explaining the most common problems encountered by women with a multiples pregnancy. She makes it clear that the main focus during the pregnancy is to get a lot of rest and adequate nourishment in order to produce babies who are as developed as possible at delivery time. She gives helpful weight guidelines, nutrition and vitamin requirements, some excellent recipes, and some much needed reassurance in what can be a stressful time. She is very NON-judgemental discussing the stages of labor at length as well as what to expect in the operating room. She encourages mother who deliver both ways to \\"take pleasure and pride in your unique maternal experience.\\" This book is comforting at a time when reassurance is much needed."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I've just now read the reviews and I couldn't agree more with all the reviewers who said this book is condescending, pessimistic and just downright depressing.What's ironic is that I actually bought the book because I WANTED to learn more about my natural childbirth options with twins. I was hoping for a book full of practical and hopeful advice on how to have the healthiest pregnancy I can have, and how I can achieve the most natural childbirth possible.Instead what I found was a depressing summary of all the things that could possibly go wrong. I can sum up the first few chapters thusly:\\"So, you are having twins! You probably took dangerous fertility drugs, didn't you? Well, you are in for it now. You'll probably have a much harder pregnancy and you'll probably have all sorts of problems. You'll most likely have to have a C-section, they will be premature and will have trouble breast-feeding and they'll probably have problems their whole entire life. Welcome to the world of twins!\\"Sprinkled throughout the margins are such \\"helpful\\" comments from (I presume?) real mothers of multiples along the lines of \\"I didn't stop crying for 3 months.\\" Or \\"Don't worry about when to have sex, you'll never want sex again!\\"I'm returning this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I am pregnant with twins and a friend bought me this book as a gift. I am so happy she left the gift receipt in the book! I can't wait to return it!! This book was shocking, bizarre, and extremely one-sided. Sections of it were downright scary and INSULTING. Don't waste your money. The author does not present information for the reader to consider, instead she preaches. Sections of the book made even me angry. We are human beings. Perhaps the author forgot this as she wrote parts of this book."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book because i wanted to learn more about twins. I do not usually post reviews but I chose to make an exception. The book is very disorganized, has alot of negative stuff in the book that unless your doctor advise's you there is problem, most pregnant woman could do without reading. As if pregnant woman dont worry enough on their own! I basically stopped reading after i came to a chapter on nutrition that stated if i drink cow's milk i might as well attach my babies to a cow's udder.

Most other resources hype the dangers associated with twin birth and how twin birth is \\"high risk,\\" and in need of much medical intervention. This book is informative about the medical needs of a twin pregnacy while emphasizing a holistic approach. The fact that she gives examples of twin homebirths is so wonderful and has been such a comfort to us. My only concern about this book is her clear issues with animal products which I have found to be very useful and healthful for my preganancy. If you are thinking about natural childbirth, breastfeeding, homebirth, and believe that birth is a natural activity for women this book will be very useful."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"The title should read \\"Having twins and more, ELIZABETH NOBLE'S one sided, narrowminded, religious undertoned guide to multiple pregnancy, birth and early childhood.\\" This was the first book my wife and I received as a gift shortly after we found out we were expecting twins. We have no children and I was eager to start educating myself about having multiples. As mentioned in another review I should have taken note that she mentions the negative criticism about this book on Amazon. She mixes old and new data and statistics to find the hair in the egg on just about every subject. She also includes many statistics from other countries that just do not apply to the U.S. She refers to this as \\"telling it how it is.\\" She claims that she has a duty as an author to present the facts good or bad, but is it her duty to inflect her own personal opinions and agenda within the data and have the nerve to market this book as an impartial guide to parenting? Example one, she refers to IVF as imposing on God's will. Specifically \\"The risks associated with higher-order multiples is the price parents pay to enter the club where formerly \\"only God chose the members.\\"\\" Example two, Circumcision- \\"One hundred percent of baby boys oppose this mutilating surgery and so should you-their screams of betrayal and protest are ignored by those who are cutting.\\" It's this kind of opinionated shock writing that she imposes on the reader throughout the book. She does not just present the facts as she would like you to believe, she repeatedly injects her own biased opinions at the expense of making an expecting parent feel guilty and ashamed if they differ from her methods and values. Please research this book before you purchase it."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Elizabeth Noble has inspired me for a quarter of a century. Her revision of the classic Having Twins informs us how thoroughly the &quot;Birth Machine&quot; has infiltrated childbirth. My twins were born almost 30 years ago. During active labor, I was measured, sonogramed, x-rayed, and told I would need a cesarean so I then checked myself out of the hospital, went home, and gave natural birth to my twin daughters. As a mother of six children including twins, I know that it is easier to birth two babies than one and the the higher risk involved depends on who attends the birth, if they know that twins will be born, and if they have been medically educated beyond our mammailian intelligence. (Read the MIDRS study verifying this, if you doubt.) Thank you Elizabeth for a wonderful contribution to the growing childbirth library. The hand that rocks the Birth Machine frees the world."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"Thank you, Ms. Noble, for reminding all of us that being pregnant is not a DISEASE or a diagnosis but a naturally occuring event in our life cycle. She eloquently reminds us all to embrace our bodies, minds and spirits to nurture and protect our unborn children as well as ourselves. She provides glorious insight into the choices that we are capable of making. Most of us are scared into beleiving we need every test and measure simply because it is the &quot;norm&quot; in today's standards. Not many of us keep in mind that giving birth is the one process that has been occuring long before the medical profession has intervened in this process. Ms. Noble focuses her energy and attention on wellness and prevention which is a refreshing change from all the books out there that focus on interventions available. Maybe if more of us paid attention to our well being we wouldn't need so much intervention from the medical community. I must commend her for writing such a comprehensive book that truly empowers women to make choices."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This book was like a bible to me during my pregnancy, and now 3 years on I still read parts of it regularly. A really refreshing perspective on multiple pregnancy (not the usual &quot;high risk&quot; doom &amp; gloom), with down to earth info on healthy multiple pregnancy, positive birth experiences, feeding and raising multiples. Covers areas that are completely missed, or only skimmed over in other multiples books, like birth plans, post maturity, making arrangements in the event of loss of a baby, etc. The section on postnatal exercises came in very handy!This book educates, rather than dictates, empowering the reader to make informed decisions about their maternity care, and what is best for their babies and themselves.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I picked up this book locally when I found I was carrying twins. I read a few short sections and didn't notice anything too bad. When I really started reading it, I was very disappointed.As others have mentioned, it's poorly written with some sections full of pretty technical information (too much--this from someone who majored in science and works in a technical field) to touchy-feely areas with no kind of backup information.The authors are also very dismissive if you don't or can't follow the suggestions (rules). They also use \\"nocebo\\" (a play on \\"placebo\\") for particular people/professions/advice who might discourage mothers from following the rules.There's a suggestion to pack on weight very early in the pregnancy to help the babies weigh as much as possible at birth. Considering that you're only storing fat, I think that's irresponsible advice. I'm also already very overweight and this advice would probably push me into type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.The main author is Australian and Australia may have better leave for parents than the US which is reflected in some of the advice. Most working parents in the US must battle for more than a few months of leave, and some of that will probably be unpaid. (One recommendation is to breastfeed for 2-3 years. Um, no, sorry.)This book really upset me and I'm glad that I had already done enough research elsewhere to not take this book's attitude to heart.When a great friend found out the news and said she wanted to get me a book on pregnancy for my birthday, I asked for the Mayo Clinic one. Although there only about a chapter on multiples, the overall tone, organization, graphics, etc are miles away better."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"This book goes against the grain in terms of conventional approaches to multiple pregnancy, birth and parenting. Elizabeth Nobel does not accept the norm of highly interventionist pregnancies and births where care is not evidence based and mothers, their bodies and their babies are undermined at every turn. Instead she presents a realistic and research based book giving parents evidence based information that they can use to make truly informed decisions about the best care for themselves and their children. Having Twins might surprise you and challenge you, but the research is solid and she puts the responsibility and the power to bear and raise our children back into the hands of mothers where it belongs.Having had 2 sets of twins myself, and supported families having multiples for almost a decade, I feel that this book along with Mothering Multiples by Karen Kerckhoff-Gromada are the best books on the market for families expecting multiples."},{"Title":"Having Twins And More: A Parent's Guide to Multiple Pregnancy, Birth, and Early Childhood","review":"I bought this book for $3 and still feel like it was a huge waste of money. The author is VERY pessimistic and odd. In her introduction all she does is depress the reader. Being 6 months pregnant with twins I need all the helpful (and upbeat) info. I can get. She talks almost completely about the problems twins have and increased chances for health issues and death. I quit reading the introduction because it was just making me sad and paranoid. Skipped onto more relevant topics and could not believe some of the stuff she came up with. Just got done reading how \\"\\"bassinets are optional. Sleeping with your twins in the family bed is the easiest solution, or the babies can be put down in padded drawers, laundry baskets, a mattress on the floor, or even in a large box\\" WHAT!?!?!?!? Put your babies in a box? I don't even agree with co-sleeping, having a friend who's baby suffocated after her husband pushed it too far into the pillows, but a box or laundry basket, what are we caveman? Maybe this book gets really great in the second half (I would bet my life it doesn't) but I am not going to waste my time reading to find out.

Now my twins are 8 months old. This book will make you unnecessarily anxious and upset and the author tries to push her own opinions on childbirth and pretend they have a scientific basis. The fact opf the matter is a lot of twin moms end up having c-sections. This isn't just because doctor's are c-section happy but because it is often medically necessary. Just one exapmple of how evil this book is, is that it pertrays a c-section as a very scary and horrible thing for the mom and the babies. In fact, she even goes on to imply that your babies may have some horrible lasting memories of their traumatic c-section birth that they will ask you about in later years. Give me a break!

I have had several children, and am expecting twins now. This book gives the medical side of everything having to do with twins, as well as the emotional side. She is very well researched, and steps outside the mainstream side of the birthing process. There are alternatives,it is possible to have a great twin delivery, but it all starts with nutrition.

She makes you feel like if you have to have a cesarean- you are already a failure as a mother! She also highlights people's regressed memories of fertilization and their loss of a twin before birth!

The .NET documentation is missing in several areaas and this book helps fill in the gaps that the docs have in security. But this book IS NOT a regurgitation of what I can find in the docs. It is new materialThe first couple of chapters make it very clear how to do encryption with .NET. This is the first time I have seen an explanation for what the IV key is for in the encryption algorithms.I was pleasantly surprised to see the discussion in chapter 3 about XML encryption. The standards for this are just coming into scope and this chapter does a nice job of describing what is happening in this space.Code access security is a tught topic to cover in a short chaptyer but the authors do a good job. Again, there is a lot of hype about code access security but you have to look hard to find any real information about it. While I don't have to worry about this right now, this chapter gave me a good understanding of what is possible and how to do it.I also found the last chapters on remoting and ASP.NET interesting and learned a few things in each chaptyer.Is this book a 'cover everything including the kitchen sink' refernce? No. But it is a very good book for anyone who wants a good, solid introduction to the capabilities of .NET security and cryptography. And for me, that is important! Give me information that I can use and work with now. Not more reference material that I need to digest and sort through."},{"Title":".NET Security","review":".NET Security( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590538/ ), byJason Bock, Pete Stromquist, Tom Fischer, Nathan Smith, is a very goodIntermediate level book. They have touched upon all of the topics ofinterest when it comes to security in the .NET Framework going into fairamount of details whenever necessary.First chapter starts off with a introduction to Cryptography, good forsomeone who is just starting off learning about cryptography, a goodrefresher for others who already know about the basics of cryptography.Second chapter then goes on to talk about how the various cryptographyclasses have been implemented in the .NET framework and how they can beused. They talk about both symmetric and asymetric algorithms, Random NumberGeneration, Hashing etc. They even mention Salting, something that's notvery well documented.Third chapter talks about Xml Encryption and including Digital Signatures inXml Documents, this specification was so new when .NET came out that I wassurprised to see the Xml Signature implementation in the System.Securitynamespace, the downside though as a result was very little documentation,not any more though, the third chapter talks about everything one needs toknow about Xml Encryption and Signatures in detail.The fourth chapters goes into a good amount of detail on Code AccessSecurity. The authors show a good mix of managing security using both codeand also using the Control Panel utilities. They go on to write and deploytheirown permission class.The rest of the book talks about Security when using Remoting and also RoleBased Security, in short they talk aboutsecurity considerations in every kind of scenario. The chapters on ASP.NETsecurity and MS Passport were not that useful to me though since thosetopics have pretty much been beaten to death by every ASP.NET book outthere. Oh yes the last chapter on the risks of decompiling .NET assembliesand suggestions on how to mitigate that was a good read.APress seems to have developed a knack for publishing books that are thinand to the point, this one is no exception, I'd give this book an 8 on 10. Iwould've given it a higher rating if it would've talked about theAllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute, I think a discussion of CAS isincomplete without the mention of this attribute.Other books out there that cover Security in .NET are the following1. .NET Framework Security(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067232184X/ ). I saw the table ofcontents for this book, it pretty much covered everything this book covers,this book was a whole lot thicker though, so I did thumb thru it at [a local store], thought the first 3 chapters or so were useless as they talked aboutsecurity risks, thought that was pointless since I know pretty much what therisks are hence I am reading about security :), thought the .NET Security book by APress bookcovered pretty much everything that this book has and in a more concise way..."},{"Title":".NET Security","review":"It covered all the topics you would expect, but it is mostly a just a good overview of .NET security. I expected more in-depth coverage for a book titled as such. It has only a very brief overview of encryption algorithms without enough real world examples in my opinion, being an advanced .NET programmer but new to the issue of security.The book is actually quite thin compared to its competition, so that should have tipped me off. You could go through it in a couple of days, but the price doesn't reflect that. I was really impressed with the .NET Programming with C# book from the same (small) publisher, so I was really hoping for a lot more. Consider the table of contents and decide for yourself whether this books warrants a purchase. It's a reasonably new topic of course so there are only a few other choices out there right now."},{"Title":".NET Security","review":"I bought this book in hopes it would add to the excellent information in the book &quot;.NET Framework Security&quot;.Alas, the book's various topics are only given lip service.If you're looking for a hard core analysis of code access security, only buy this as a secondary reference."},{"Title":"How come Christmas,: A modern morality,","review":"This is a quaint book which portrays a unique twist on the Christmas story. Those individuals who have grown up on the coastal SC/GA islands will recognize the style of grammar as that of Gullah or Geechee. This book could be considered as &quot;racially controversial&quot; in these times, however, it must be understood that it harkens back to a earlier century and that should guide the reader. Those individuals who have not experienced Gullah/Geechee before, might have a difficult time reading and pronouncing words in this book.It is interesting how Roark spins the tale of Jesus, and Santa Claus and how at the end of this short story, both of them seem so necessary to make our Christmas story complete.

C. Harris \\"Uncle Remus's Songs and Stories,\\" Ambrose Gonzales' \\"With Aesop Along the Black Border\\" and other versions of Black folklore that is an admitted lost art today in historical context, and I tried to read this in that aspect, but I was pretty ticked off by the beginning of this.Essentially, a group of Black children in what rural Louisiana (where Bradford usually based his stories) are listening to a Black preacher who confuses George Washington, Santa Claus, and the birth of Jesus into one story as he attempts to tell the Christmas story (or his version thereof). Had this been a case of a child doing this (as in Linus Van Pelt's confusion of Christmas and Halloween as \\"The Great Pumpkin\\" in the Peanuts cartoons) or amusing variations of Biblical stories that were not too far off the mark as was the case in Bradford's Ol' Man Adam & his Chillun\\" (which later became the film \\"The Green Pastures\\" which I enjoyed), I would probably see the humor in this. But to show a preacher and leader of a desperate and suffering people people being this ignorant for comedic purposes is not funny to me when you consider the fact that many rural black sharecroppers in the South in those days were kept into enforcred illiteracy to serve as a permanent supply of cheap labor. I'm no fan of political correctness and I would not want to see this banned as it is a part of literary history, it's just not for me and I've sen better books of this kind.That said, the ending of this story is admittedly quite charming and is the book's redeeming value. The crude farce of a sermon takes a rather lovely turn at the story winds down. How? See for yourself...but sensitive readers be warned."},{"Title":"Dancing With Witches","review":"I was eager to get my teeth into this book, after having been a huge fan of the author's first book &quot;Autobiography of a Witch&quot; which I read over a decade ago. However, this book seemed more about the association and friendship with Gerald Gardner (and about his character), and a history lesson throughout some of the travels mentioned in the book. There is mention about the experiences of being a part of and working in a coven, and also chapters about some other interesting witches Lois Bourne has met throughout the course of time which delighted my intrigue. But all in all it wasn't quite what I had anticipated or hoped for. Still worth the read, so long as you don't pre-empt the guts of the book by the suggestive title."},{"Title":"Dancing With Witches","review":"This is another excellent book from Lois Bourne, one of my favorite authors.

Lucky for readers, Les Standiford manages to pull it off in his biographal/historical narrative \\"Meet You in Hell.\\"I've read historical biographies of both men along with Carnegie's autobiography, works that tend to reinforce readers with author biases by either lauding or condemning or justifying the actions taken by these two men.\\"Meet You in Hell\\" stands at the top of the list for its evenhanded execution in probing the background and characters of these two titans, their partnership, their rivalry, their falling out and their increasingly bitter efforts at one-upsmanship.Were it a novel, many of the actions that occur between these two men could scarcely be believed. Standiford makes these real events believable and understandable.Carnegie and Frick were giants of their age who accomplished a great deal. Much of what was accomplished was on the backs of their workers. This was America's age of unchecked capitalism by a power elite with few controls or government regulations in place.\\"Meet You in Hell\\" is a great hook-line which Standiford baits right at the beginning. As a reader, you'll know why by the end of the book. Five stars."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"High impact American history driven by the empire builders;Les Standiford builds the rags to riches American dream come true balanced with the $1.40 a twelve hour a day working stiffs struggle to survive.The author has created another excellent must read documentary."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"Author does an excellent job in describing the era and the personalities of Carnegie and Frick. I often wonder what happens to people, their egos or an uncontrollable desire for more wealth, when they have it all, and can't possibly use anymore than what they have. Conversely, at the other end are the people that made them rich, and those workers get treated worse than dogs. Carnegie is a complex figure, letting Frick be the bad guy, but him being silent during most of the Homestead Steel Works nasty strike. Frick was probably confused, and irritated about Carnegie'w role in the strike, as were the Sheriff, National Guard, union leaders, etc. Former employees were starving and uncertain about their futures, and some dying, while Carnegie and his family were vacationing in Scotland. After the long strike, Carnegie and Frick lost their friendship and work association, and never spoke to each other after Frick resigned. Of course, Carnegie later made amends with society with his donated free libraries and charities. A good book, accurate writing, and well worth the few bucks."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"Two men with incredible drive and egos. At one time business partners, but that was history. And that is where the real story begins.Author Les Standiford delivers a classic on the fractious professional relationship of Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, with the backdrop being the 1892 Battle of Homestead (Pennsylvania) between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and the Carnegie Steel Company, the control of its \\"history\\" and the aftermath for both men, which ultimately found them at war....between themselves.But in the Spring of 1919 a frail Carnegie, 83, sent an emissary - with letter in hand - to Frick, seeking a meeting to reconcile their differences. \\"But, so far as anyone knew, the two men had not exchanged a word in nearly twenty years - not since Carnegie drove Frick out of the business and Frick successfully pressed a monumental lawsuit against his former partner, the first in a long string of vengeful acts,\\" writes Standiford.And how Frick, 69, responded - \\"Tell him I'll see him in Hell, where we both are going\\" - spoke volumes on an old rivalry that would (soon) go to their graves. Frick died in December, while Carnegie had passed away in August. \\"He'd gone toe-to-toe with strikers, assassins, and even Carnegie himself, and had rarely met a grudge he could not hold. Long before Frick had constructed the mansion that would dwarf Carnegie's 'Highlands' up the street, he had gone out of his way to purchase tract of land in downtown Pittsburgh, then built a skyscraper tall enough to cast Carnegie's own office building next door in perpetual shadow,\\" Standiford writes.Standiford meticulously travels through the shadows to find the real story of the two men that goes beyond the philanthropic Carnegie and Frick's financial wizardry.

Interested in learning more about the Homestead lockout/strike of 1892, I purchased this book and was never disappointed. Very readable... and entertaining. The author has a gift for bringing to life people and events that surely could have been dull and boring. I thank every steel worker who ever worked at Homestead, for every ride at Kennywood Amusement Park and for every steel framed skyscraper/construction that exist in my own New York City home!

Thank you."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"Set in the days when Horatio Alger preached the gospel of expansion and mobility hand in hand, this book shows the best and worst of American capitalism. John Calvin once said, \\"If I have not been able to avoid the reputation of being rich during my life, death will at last free me from this stain.\\" Carneigie was considered \\"the world's richest man\\" back in the gilded age, the father of American industry.On his death bed in 1919, possibly to have a clear conscience about that fateful steel strike of 1892, he wanted to make things right with Henry Clay Frick. It had been more than twenty years since their business relationship soured, but Frick would not give in, saying \\"tell him ... I'll see him in hell\\" -- so fierce was their dispute. He died the same year.The bloody steelworkers' strike had changed their partnership into a furious rivalry. Both were propotents of Darwin's treaching about survival of the fittest. Carnegie was head of the United States Steel Corporation and Frick was a coke magnate who he had entrusted his companies. The steel industry comprised late 19th century rough-and-tumble \\"big business\\" and, with their cost control and applied efficiences, they became dominate in the world steel market.Because of the disastrous way they handled the 1892 strike, their names stand for the worst possible business management to union members everywhere. Frick, acting on Carnegie's orders, set 300 Pinkerton detectives against the uprising workers, and it was the bloodiest management/labor conflict in the United States of America history. The blame went to Frick as he was present at the horrific scene.Success consecrates the most offensive crimes. (Seneca) This reminds me of Howard Hughes' end; there was just no way Frick could forgive. Les Standiford has also written LAST TRAIN TO PARADISE, DONE DEAL, BLACK MOUNTAIN and OPENING DAY: OR, THE RETURN OF SATCHEL PAIGE. Many archival materials pertaining to the business dealing of the characters above can be found at the University of Pittsburgh's Hillman Library."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"The stage is set in the Gilded Age with rages to riches personalities and a corporate war they waged against its own workers which broke the ability to maintain unions and undermined working Americans rights for decades to come all in the name of monopoly, profits, and greed. This is the story of Andrew Carnegie (of the Steel Industry) and how his partnerships with Henry Flick (of the Coke industry) lead to the 1892 Battle of Homestead in Pittsburg. Carnegie held out in a castle in Scotland while Flick hired the Pinkertons and refused to negotiate all of which lead to a deadly clash on the Monongahela River.Standiford grabs your attention at the beginning with a flash forward to 1919 to shortly before Carnegie and Frick died (they died within months of each other). Carnegie reached out to Frick via a letter hand delivered by James Bridge requesting a meeting, perhaps reconcile. Frick reply to Bridge was, \` \\"Yes, you can tell Carnegie I'll meet him,\\" Frick said finally, wadding the letter and tossing it back at Bridge. \\"Tell him I'll see him in Hell, where we both are going.\\" \` This at a time when Carnegie was building his reputation for philanthropy with his building of libraries and campaigns for world peace and the league of nations, and Frick was building his huge art collection. The book outlines the parallel careers, the events, and conflicts that lead to these bitter feelings.If your at all interested in Gilded age business practices, the history of Pittsburg, the Steel Industry, or just a couple of unique personal stories you may be drawn to this book. I found it both informative, a refresher, and an interesting take that Carnegie not only implements a spoiled earth policy against his own workers, but could also turn on a partner when he thought he could profit."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"Two men with incredible drive and egos.

That the partnership between Carnegie (steel) and Frick (coke) was bitter was, so far as anything this book shows, immaterial to that. The outcome would not have been different if they had gotten along well.There is an enormous literature about steel and the different approaches of the American and British makers, the consequences of having the foundries concentrated so far east as Pittsburgh when the demand was moving west, metallurgical innovations etc. \\"Meet You in Hell\\" is innocent of all that.A lot of time is spent ruminating over Carnegie's well-known inconsistencies about being rich. How that changed America is not explained. Standiford makes much of the \\"facts\\" that Carnegie was the richest man in the world and the most spectacular philanthropist -- neither of which was actually true.Nor it is explained why Carnegie's philanthropy, which arose from ideas he was forming before he met Frick, had much to do with the partnership. Had Carnegie gone bust -- as might have happened -- Rockefeller would have given away twice as much, and Rockefeller's philanthropy also was based on what he decided in his young manhood.For a time, while reading the book, I thought Standiford was going to do something with the Homestead strike of 1892, which really was a watershed in the way Americans behave. However, he doesn't do much to explain how labor conditions were trending before the Homestead violence, nor how they did so afterward. Besides, although Carnegie and Frick were feuding about lots of things, they were as one during Homestead.\\"Meet You in Hell\\" adds nothing to what has long been known about Carnegie and Frick. If the intention was to introduce the episode to a new generation that never heard of either man, then the book is short on background."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"MR.

The problem with this book begins there. Its center is the Homestead Strike and labor unrest in an industrial giant and the beginning of organized labor in the face of very powerful and often ruthless business organizations. The author states upfront his goal was to \\"focus upoon the thread of a relationship (between Carnegie and Frick)and have restricted my attention for the most part to matters pertaining thereto\\". I was expecting a true look into the partnership between the two such as No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearns Goodwin (where she brilliantly wrote of Franklin and Elenor Roosevelt's relationship and the effects it had on public policy as well as their own lives). I was sadly disappointed.This book is a short, if disjointed read. Just over 300 pages and it isn't until the last 50 that Standiford turns his attention to the relationship between these two very powerful and driven men. The bibliography should be read before one even reads page one. It is one and a half pages, most undergraduate college papers have done greater \\"research\\". The author at times seems to derail himself in the rare instances where he might capture the reader's attention. In discussing in detail the Homestead Strike he states, at the beginning of a chapter, \\"Had this been a modern-day standoff, with Frick in close touch . . . by cell phone and Carnegie observing the scene via CNN satellite feed . . . \\". This incredibly obvious note was nonscensical. All history would be different if communications were instant rather than weeks and even months just a relatively short time ago. Either Standiford is not qualified to write history (certainly a possibility if you see his creditials) or he thinks his readers daft.This book is only slightly interesting if you would like to learn more about the Homestead Strike and, even there, it adds no real insight. I finished it only as I was determined to learn more about Carnegie and Frick and, importantly, their parnership. I did not. I would caution that any serious readers of history not make the same mistake I did thinking that something could be learned by reading this pithy writing. It cannot.Most succinctly put, books about history should be written by qualified historians. This one was not."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I think the author tried to rope in the conflict at Homestead as the reason for the split of these two greedy capitalists. Their conflict was due to want of money, not the position of what was best at Homestead. Frick wanted to wage war on his employees, while Carnegie wanted to starve them out. I don't think there is much difference. However, the conflict at Homestead showed how these early venture capitalists were unconcerned for their employees. Make big money, and reduce costs (employee wages) and get rich in the process.This is the sad tale of two wretched men who destroyed the lives of thousands. They were successful, but at a cost. I hope that they do speand a eternity where they deserve it most. I think the author did a good job of detailing the conflict at Homestead, and what mattered.

Morgan, and Vanderbilt. Folks like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett carry only a whisper of the Goliath stature that was attained by a select few in the 1800s.\\"Meet You in Hell\\" is Les Standiford's telling of the story of the rise and fall of a relationship between two such men, Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick. Frick, the lesser known of the two, created an empire of his own in coke production (the steel-making input, not the soda or the drug) before being swallowed up by Carnegie Steel and agreeing to run that entire operation for Carnegie.Carnegie was a man accustomed to getting his own way, but his new employee Frick possessed his own ideas on how a company should be run. The differences between the two surfaced occassionally early in their relationship, and were tested further by the Homestead Mill strike in 1890s which ended in the deaths of many strikers and Pinkerton detectives.This conflict is the true focus of this book, but interestingly doesn't come across as the watershed in the relationship between Carnegie and Frick that Standiford really wants it to be for the sake of his book. That honor comes later, when Frick tries to trick Carnegie into selling his company to a secret group of speculators with a terrible reputation on Wall Street.This book is still quite an interesting story about the Homestead strike, labor relations in the industrial age, and the realtionship between two titans of industry, but the stories don't mesh the way Standiford sets you up to believe they will. That doesn't hurt this book much - it's still well worth reading - but it's interesting that Standiford stuck with this central premise long after his research and even his own writing showed that it had fallen apart.Flawed, but certainly not fatally so. Still recommended for its history of labor relations, the relationship between Carnegie and Frick, and the US steel industry. An engaging and informative read."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"\\"Meet You In Hell\\" tells the fascinating stories of Steel King Andrew Carnegie and Coke King Henry Clay Frick and their interactions which shaped much of American Industrial history. It begins with sections on their personal and business backgrounds. It explains how their careers became intertwined as Frick's coke company became a primary supplier to Carnegie Steel. The breaking point of their relationship was the riot at the Homestead Mill, which was opposed by Frick while Carnegie remained in Scotland. Thereafter they became bitter rivals to their deaths.As readers of my Amazon reviews are aware, I am an avid reader of history. This, while being history, is neither political nor military and, thereby, provides a different insight into forces which molded our nation.Two ways that I evaluate books is by whether they teach me things that I did not know or if they do whet my appetite to read more on the subject. \\"Meet You In Hell\\" scores well on both tests. I was aware that Pinkerton agents were often used by management in labor disputes. The narrative dealing with the Battle of Homestead illustrates just how violent those disputes were. I had often seen Carnegie Libraries, but I did not realize that he was so resented among the laboring classes. After reading this I cannot wait until I can read another book on Industrial History. Any book that can ace both of these tests merits high marks."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"The dramatic centerpiece of Les Standiford's dual biography of Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick is the bloody clash between striking steelworkers and imported Pinkerton \\"detectives\\" at Carnegie's Homestead, PA plant in early July of 1892. Fourteen people were killed in that battle, and many more injured.Homestead may have been the signature event in the intertwined careers of Carnegie and Frick, but Standiford's book makes clear that it was not the reason that their close partnership turned to bitter enmity and mutual recrimination. Their breakup came seven or eight years later over a disagreement concerning a proposed sale of the giant Carnegie firm to outside investors whose credentials and intentions were suspect.Thus, while Standiford's account of the week-long Homestead crisis is cinematically vivid, it does not by itself tell the whole story of the two men's lives. Both were born dirt poor (Carnegie in Scotland, Frick in western Pennsylvania) and rose through the industrial ranks through their own strong ambition and financial cunning. They joined forces only when they found they needed each other. Carnegie was the top man, Frick the on-site chief operating officer.Carnegie at least publicly claimed to support working men and their right to organize, but Frick was an unapologetic anti-union hardliner. When Homestead exploded in gunfire and mob violence, Carnegie, vacationing back in Scotland, gave Frick full support for whatever means he adopted to suppress the strikers and keep the company sound. Only after it was all over and the dead had been counted did Carnegie express some mild criticism of Frick's tactics.Standiford emphasizes the strong faith placed by both men in \\"social Darwinism,\\" the idea that only companies willing to do whatever it took to survive would prosper in the industrial jungles. The welfare of the workforce made a nice topic for ceremonial speeches but was never high on their list of real priorities.Both men also believed that the key to success in industry was strict control of costs rather than counting up profits or dividends. And after they became wealthy, both men sought to burnish their public images --- Carnegie by donating almost 3,000 community libraries and financing a host of other projects, Frick by amassing what is still regarded today as one of the great private art collections.Standiford tells this complex tale in the style of a practiced writer (he has written ten novels and three other works of nonfiction). His research has been thorough, though his text is not without errors (Saugus, home of the earliest blast furnace in the United States, is in Massachusetts, not Michigan; Carnegie Hall was opened in 1891, not 1892). He does about as well as anyone could in trying to clarify the byzantine workings of high finance in the steel industry, a subject pretty much impossible to make interesting to non-millionaires.Frick and Carnegie are present in Standiford's pages in all their personal complexity and baffling contradictions. There are also minor characters orbiting around them who are memorably portrayed, notably a union leader named Hugh O'Donnell who did his best to keep the militant steelworkers from erupting and tried vainly to find a way to head off the violence.In the end, Frick was finally forced out of his high position in Carnegie's company and the two men ended their lives bitter enemies. Standiford's title is a paraphrase of a remark Frick made in the spring of 1919 in response to an offer of meeting and reconciliation from Carnegie: \\"Tell him I'll see him in hell, where we are both going.\\" They died within weeks of each other that very year.Standiford has done a good job of bringing before a new generation this classic love-hate story played out among smoky steel plants and lavish residential palaces. He has a tendency now and then to sermonize unnecessarily, but his basic story is both relevant and enthralling. The ghosts of his two protagonists, if they are still feuding in the hereafter, will at least find his book reasonably balanced and a valuable reminder of a crucial period in America's industrial history.--- Reviewed by Robert Finn (Robertfinn@aol.com)"},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"This is well-covered territory for any avid student of steel's history: the rise of two great pillars of the steel industry, the focal event based on the bloody Homestead strike, and the increasingly bitter demise in the relationship between Frick and Carnegie that followed. The two preceding Amazon reviews provide excellent insight as to the value of the book and the character of the men.Homestead produced, in final count, thrity-one deaths. The original clash, in early July 1892, just outside of Pittsburgh, killed a small number of men. One Pinkerton guard brashly shot himself in the head in front of his colleagues stuck in the barge rather than fall into the hands of the strikers. Carnegie -- by most accounts -- felt betrayed by Frick's hard-nosed handling of the Homestead crisis. Carnegie insisted, especially after the deaths of Pinkerton \\"police\\" and strking workers -- that he would have just let the plant stay idle, wait the strikers out, and offer them no reason to fight. Carnegie wanted to be loved; he dreamed that a worker might even say, \\"If only you had been here, this would not have happended.\\" Frick would not have any of this. He had firm, well-entrenced ideas not only about his rights as a capitalist, but also in his skills and obligations as Carnegie's chief operating officer.The book does best at constrasting these two men. In some respects they were very much alike. \\"Ruthless\\" is not too harsh a word to describe the manner in which they cut costs, built their networks of industries, and squeezed out minor players. They were the masters of the dominant network of the day, based on steel and rail. As entrepreneurs Carnegie may still have not found an equal, not even in Bill Gates, although there are some parallels in the lives and methods of the two men. Frick comes across more as the master implementer, less of the visionary that Carnegie appears to have been. Frick, tied most closely to the production of coke, was a little further down the industrial stream.The final conflict was more of a clash of egoes, with both men realizing that their personal fortunes lie with a schism. When Frick did not get his way in the split of the wealth, after thinking he had Carnegie's commitment, he was never going to forgive Carnegie for stepping back from the deal. Carnegie, on the other hand, felt Frick tried to front for some unscrupulous buyers and, despite Carnegie's own ruthless tactics, found Frick's friends to be unsavory. Such a divide between two such men was perhaps inevitable.The research is rich; the book is full of details. What it lacks, in this reviewer's mind, is the full color of the story, of the poverty and squalor of the working men, just as much the ricj splendor of the wealthy. The story moves quickly across the lives of the men as well as the birth of the industries that they helped to create. There are three stories here -- Carnegie, Frick, and Homestead -- requiring perhaps more than any one book can provide."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Mellon University. The Carnegie Library - not just 1, but 3000 of them throughout the English speaking world. Much of the legacy of Andrew Carnegie is that of his philanthropic efforts. In 1901 Andrew Carnegie received nearly $230 million from the sale of Carnegie Steel. He spent the rest of his life giving away almost all of that fortune.Henry Clay Frick, Carnegie's one-time partner at Carnegie Steel, directed that his mansion and personal art collection be converted into an art museum upon his death. His Pittsburgh mansion, Clayton, is a popular field trip site in Western Pennsylvania.Andrew Carnegie was the founder of Carnegie Steel, and Henry Clay Frick founded HC Frick Coke, supplier to Carnegie Steel, who eventually became Carnegie's business partner. But over time their relationship soured, and they became estranged to the point that, when Carnegie sought a meeting of reconciliation in 1919, Frick's response was, \\"Yes, you can tell Carnegie I'll meet him. Tell him I'll see him in Hell, where we both are going.\\"The intertwining of the lives and business dealings of Carnegie and Frick are the subject of \\"Meet you in hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the bitter partnership that transformed America\\" by Les Standiford. The book is something of a highly abbreviated biography of both men, concentrating on the time period during which Frick was the Chairman of Carnegie Steel.The book spends a significant amount of time discussing the events surrounding the Homestead strike of 1892, which found Carnegie, who portrayed himself as pro-labor, conveniently spending the summer in Scotland while Frick managed the events of the strike, bringing in non-union workers and a detail of 300 Pinkerton agents. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 3 Pinkerton agents and 7 strikers, with many others on both sides of the confrontation being wounded. One result of the failed strike was that union organizing in the steel industry was dealt a serious blow from which it did not recover until the 1930s. The strike also set in motion the events leading to the falling out of Frick and Carnegie, which took place over several years until Frick was finally ousted in 1900.Despite this book's title, it's not solely about the conflict(s) between Carnegie and Frick. Rather, it's a short and interesting history of two of the most prominent players in the rise of the steel industry in America. Brought together by the steel industry, they forged a successful business partnership, had some conflicts, and acrimoniously parted ways. Carnegie and Frick experienced the conflicts that are the norm among the giant egos of the business world, both past and present.I found this to be an interesting book. I had heard of the Homestead Strike, but hadn't learned any of its history. And I certainly knew the names of Frick, Carnegie, Phipps, Mellon, and other prominent Pittsburghers, but I didn't know how they all fit into the Pittsburgh history picture. This book provides a good overview of these topics. Standiford does display a strong pro-union bias throughout the book, always referring to the replacement workers as \\"scabs,\\" for example, when detailing the events of the Homestead Strike. This makes it more difficult for the reader to distill the objective history from the author's opinions.I do recommend this book for readers who want to acquaint themselves with the names of Carnegie and Frick, as well as those looking for an overview of the birth of America's steel industry, including a popular summary of the events of the Homestead strike. The book may pique the reader's interest for further reading about these events. But even if this book is all that you ever read on these topics, you'll be more educated for having done so."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"They say that those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. It has been my observation that the overwhelming majority of students who have graduated from our high schools in the past quarter century are pretty clueless about American history in general and about the history of the labor movement in this country in particular. Most are blissfully unaware of the sacrifices and hardships our ancestors endured in the struggle for better working conditions. I would strongly recommend Les Standiford's great new book \\"Meet You In Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America\\" to history and civics teachers everywhere. It would be a great book for your class to read and offers a tremendous opportunity to discuss with your students the pros and cons of our capitalist system.\\"Meet You In Hell\\" chronicles the lives of two American industrial giants. Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie represent the consummate \\"rags to riches\\" story that we so romanticize in this country. These two men helped to forge America's steel industry and would play a major role in the transormation of the United States from an agrarian society into the most powerful nation on earth. Yes, America is indeed the land of opportunity and our young people should realize that capitalism offers them opportunities that other economic systems simply do not afford. At the same time \\"Meet You In Hell\\" will make young people acutely aware of what can happen when capitalism goes awry. For this was clearly the case in the town of Homestead, Pa. in the summer of 1892 when Henry Clay Frick with the tacit approval of Andrew Carnegie commissioned Pinkerton guards and brought in boatloads of \\"scabs\\" in response to a labor dispute at the Carnegie Steel mill. The violence and carnage that resulted from that grim confrontation is still considered to be one of the low points in management-labor relations in this country.\\"Meet You In Hell\\" also offers the reader a glimpse into the rather complicated and often turbulent relationship between Carnegie and Frick. In retrospect, it is really quite amazing that their business relationship lasted as long as it did. For these were two headstrong men with huge egos. The relationship would eventually crash and burn and Carnegie and Frick would go their seperate ways to pursue their own individual interests. Curiously, both Carnegie and Frick would spend the final years of their lives giving away the great fortunes they had amassed to worthwhile projects and institutions that would ultimately benefit us all.\\"Meet You In Hell\\" is an very readable and highly enjoyable offering. Whether or not author Les Standiford intended it, this book presents a very balanced view of the pros and cons of capitalism. Students need to understand that many of the issues presented in \\"Meet You In Hell\\" are still very relevant today. If you have done any reading at all about Wal-Mart for example you are most likely aware that this company has been accused of employing many of the same tactics against labor that were used by Frick,Carnegie and others more than a century ago. As I said earlier those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"I grew up in Pittsburgh, went to the Carnegie Library and Museum, and my dad's first office was in the splendid Frick Building. Obviously this very readable nonfiction history of Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie appealed to me for those reasons initially, but it is fascinating on so many levels.Both men rise from poverty as an immigrants in the US to become the wealthiest men in the US and probably the world. The book is interesting in its coverage of labor issues, the first labor unions, and the srike fiasco at Carnegie's Homestead works which virtually broke unions in the US for 30 yrs. Anyone in the business world will be interested in the story of how one of the greatest and largest US corporations, US Steel, came into being.

He retains a critical perspective without damning his subjects as \\"robber barons,\\" etc., seeing them in the context of their times and their essential humanity - even when behaving inhumanly.There are a few inaccuracies, inconsistencies, irrelevancies, and just plain head scratchers: as on page 29, where he states: \\"In the wake of Ireland's Great Potato Famine, the family sold everything and came, as so many of their fellow Scotsmen did, to America.\\" While this is factually true, one wonders what the Irish potato famine had to do with Scottish immigrants, particularly the Carnegies of Dunfermline. The relevance to the subject remains obscure, unless there's a connection that Mr. Standiford is not sharing with his readers. (?)In general, though, it's a good read, and a good introduction for the general reader who's just learning about the era, the fruits of which are still part of the life around him: from the 19th century buildings which yet remain in northern US cities, to the remnants of American industry, and the great financial institutions of Wall Street."},{"Title":"Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America","review":"In this lively and informative book, Les Standiford puts on record what has long been whispered in Pittsburgh and New York for more than a century. Standiford boldly tackles the once taboo subject of H C Frick's unyielding ruthlessness, compared and contrasted with Andy Carnegie's twin desires to make himself rich enough to live like a Laird in Scotland and then to cherubically make amends as his days dwindled down.Happily Mr. Standiford lifts the veil and presents the truth about J G A Leishman--a likable fellow sandwiched between two clashing titans and would-be mentors. As a student of Mr. Leishman's life and dual careers in the steel industry and international diplomacy, I was glad to see his role mentioned. Of course, there is much more to that side of the story, including the labyrinthine way that Frick engineered Leishman's ouster and ... oddly enough, repeated almost step-by-step that same performance with Leishman's future son-in-law, James Hazen Hyde, in the Equitable Insurance scandal a decade later. (Neither Patricia Beard in After the Ball nor H C F's descendent in the BIG book about his life go far enough in telling the whole story). Someday, perhaps Mr. Standiford will write a sequel to this book, all about John Leishman and his family. If so, I will be cheering him on!But back to this book, it is a must-read for anyone who has roots in Western Pennsylvania, anyone who wonders about the dark side of beneficent moguls and anyone who just wants to know what made these larger than life characters tick.The story of their two buildings in the \`Burgh is worth the price of the book!It is, one must say, most fortunate that the imposing \\"Miss Frick\\" is no longer icily holding forth from the cobwebs at Clayton.

In my imaginary postscript to the Divine Comedy, Dante would place one man, Henry Clay Frick, head down in a cauldron of molten steel but with his feet flailing sightlessly in a stylish gallery of paintings by Rembrandt and Velazquez. Henry Clay Frick prophesied roughly such a fate for himself at the end of his life. In 1919, ravaged with illness, Andrew Carnegie attempted a last-moment reconciliation with his erstwhile employee/partner, sending Frick a hand-written request for a meeting. \\"You can tell Carnegie I'll meet him,\\" Frick said when he'd read the note; \\"Tell him I'll see him in Hell, where we both are going.\\"That episode is the source of the title of Les Standiford's duo-biography of Andrew Carnegie, the iconic industrialist/philanthropist who was once the Richest Man in the World, and Henry Clay Frick, the arch-villain of American labor history and the collector of Old Master paintings now on public display in the mansion-museum that bears his name in New York City. The careers of the two steel-making multi-millionaires were so tightly intertwined that a bio of one must be a bio of both. They were, each in his own way, among the \\"founders\\" (notice the pun, please) of America's economic might and hegemony in the 20th Century.\\"Meet You in Hell\\" begins, conventionally enough, with the separate accounts of Carnegie's and Frick's early careers, until 'good business' brought them together. Basically, both men were mixtures of shrewdness and ruthlessness. Both achieved monopolistic financial control, Carnegie of steel and Frick of coke for making steel, through practices that would have gotten them jail sentences in the next century. With a fifteen year head start in age, Carnegie was always the richer, cleverer, more complex individual, replete with inner contradictions, a man whose intellect was too large to be housed in one conscience. Author of the best-selling \\"Triumphant Democracy\\" -- a book that proclaimed the Right of workers to organize in labor unions and to strike if necessary -- Carnegie was the passive patron of Frick's relentless campaign to destroy the AAISW, the steelworker's union that had emerged in the industry while Carnegie himself was at the helm. In short, Andrew Carnegie was perhaps the grandest hypocrite in American history following a certain famous slave-owner who declared that all men were created equal. Frick's steady climb to wealth was never based on innovative entrepreneurial genius; his one potent tool was cost accounting. Cutting costs to the minimum, including materials and operations, was the basis of his managerial success, from which his all profitable investments followed. 'Labor' was just another Cost to Frick, not to be complicated by any sentimental recognition that Labor consisted of human beings, flesh and blood, needing food and sleep and a modicum of dignity.The middle chapters of \\"Meet You in Hell\\" - almost half of the whole book - narrate the violent confrontation between the iron-fisted Frick and the ironworkers of the Homestead Works, the bloodiest labor-management struggle in American history. It wasn't, strictly speaking, a strike. It started as a lock-out, indeed a fortified lock-out intended to break the contracted union by adamantly refusing to negotiate with union representatives. To enforce his lock-out, Frick hired the Pinkerton detective agency to take control of the mill and to open its doors to 'scab' workers. Thousands of workers, their families, and their neighbors confronted the Pinkertons violently. People were killed, beaten, jailed, dispossessed. Sides were taken in the national press and between political rivals. Author Standiford narrates the incidents quite dramatically and objectively, though his empathy clearly lies with the workers, who were earning an average of $1.50 a day for 12-hour shifts in Hell, while Carnegie and Frick were amassing fortunes greater in adjusted dollars than Bill Gates or Warren Buffet could hope for today.In the end, the union was crushed, as were most unions in the Gilded Age of Robber Barons. The business practices of Carnegie, Frick, and their ilk would not go unregulated forever, however. The whole thrust of Teddy Roosevelt's anti-trust crusade, and of Progressivism, was aimed at curbing the maldistribution of wealth and power in a supposedly egalitarian society. Organized labor had a longer wait before matters could be redressed. FDR's \\"New Deal\\" was NOT intrinsically a program of economic recovery! That's a convenient misperception of the right wing Roosevelt-haters. It was a redistribution of power between labor and capital, legitimizing and empowering the labor movement. Frick, had he lived long enough, would have howled with rage at FDR, and Carnegie would have served ambiguously as one of the Kitchen Cabinet.The last quarter of \\"Meet You in Hell\\" hustles the reader through the scattered events of Frick's and Carnegie's post-Homestead lives. Carnegie, in effect, let himself be bought out, took his money and went home to dedicate himself to giving it away. 'A man who dies rich,' he declared, 'is a moral failure.' He managed to give away roughly four-fifths of his wealth, chiefly to educational institutions and for the founding (ever at the foundry!) of libraries in communities across the breadth of the USA. The first book I ever borrowed from a library in America came from a library built by Carnegie, the only distinguished piece of architecture in a drab farm town in the Upper Midwest.Frick continued in his management of Carnegie Steel until Wee Andrew slyly engineered his displacement. The antagonism between the two ex-partners grew into open hostility and inveterate hatred. Frick survived an assassination attempt in the year after Homestead. Abandoning Pittsburgh, he stationed himself in hostile proximity to Carnegie, mere blocks away on the Upper East Side of New York. And he devoted his ruthless will increasingly to collecting art. That aspect of his career is better told in the book \\"Old Masters, New World\\", which I reviewed just a few days ago."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"The author provides a very honest perspective on what it's like to be a grad student at Caltech. Some reviewers might be disappointed to find that the people at Caltech, including Feynman, are human and vulnerable. Mlodinow strips away the facade. At the same time, he also shows that beneath the scientific rigor, the people are more thoughtful and philosophical than one might expect. If you're a grad student at a high-powered institution (Caltech, MIT, Ivies et al), or you once were a grad student, take a couple of hours to read this book. You will relate so well to Mlodinow's experience of feeling human in a world of supposed prophets and gods. I also recommend Euclid's Window by the same author. I utterly disagree with those who criticize Mlodinow as a writer - he is both talented and entertaining."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"There are so many informative, detailed reviews here that one can appreciate how much of an impression this little book has made on its readers. Or is it that Feynman's mythic power and personality still deeply resonate years after his death? All I want to say is that this memoir from an earlier time in Mlodinow's life opens a window to the process of discovery in science and in individuals. It recalls a crucial period for the author, who was at a crossroad and was looking for guidance. Feynman guides by not guiding, and by holding up a mirror to Mlodinow. I also enjoyed the understandable explanations of scientific theories, the discussions of string theory, and the clear presentation of Babylonian/Grecian world views.This book is well worth reading for both the nonscientist and the scientist, and for all those young people seeking to find their place in the world."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"\\"It's supposed to be fun,\\" said the late, great physicist Richard Feynman, speaking of science. The Nobel laureate and emerging cult hero was watching a rainbow at the time and speaking to Leonard Mlodinow, a troubled junior colleague not sure he belonged at Cal Tech, the best physics grad school in the world.Feynman's life, from his work on the bomb as a junior scientist, to his Nobel Prize, to his emergence as a cultural figure, was a long quest to have fun, to avoid responsibility, to always be working on things he described as \\"IN-ter-ES-ting.\\" There are few great thinkers, perhaps none, who combined the search for truth and the search for fun as thoroughly as Feynman did.My first encounter with the legendary Richard Feynman was in the late '70s as an undergraduate. My physics professor informed me that, \\"If you want to be a physicist, at some point you need to get and read The Feynman Lectures. I will often take one into the woods with me and just sit and read it for pleasure.\\" I went immediately to the Harvard Coop and bought the three large red volumes that reside, always in a prominent place, on every physicist's bookshelf.Some years later, I was asked to lead a faculty book club discussion of Feynman's zany book of memoirs, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman. That this volume and the revered lectures could be the work of the same human being is nothing short of astonishing. How could the clown of Surely You're Joking have also been the genius who wrote The Feynman Lectures?Leonard Mlodinow's Feynman's Rainbow is a light-hearted look at Feynman through the eyes of a nervous junior physicist intimidated by working at the same school with some of the 20th century's greatest scientists. I read it while sitting in my gazebo, enjoying the first warm day that Boston has seen in a while. It was a delightful experience.Feynman's Rainbow is about Feynman, of course, and it contains extended quotations recorded by the author in personal conversations. But it is also about Mlodinow and his uneasy experience as a newly hired whiz kid at Cal Tech. Mlodinow did some great work in grad school on \\"extra dimensions,\\" which continues to be a hot topic. This work got him an especially juicy appointment as a sort of academic free agent. He recounts with dread his department head telling him what this meant:\\"You, Dr. Mlodinow ... are accountable to no one but yourself. You may choose to teach if you wish ... or you may choose not to teach. You may conduct research in physics, or ... biology, or in any other field you wish. If you want, you can use your time to design sailboats! We give you this freedom because we have judged you to be the best of the best, and we have confidence that, given the freedom, you will do great things.\\"Mlodinow felt the enormous pressure of such expectations and recounts with brutal honesty his experiences as he wandered about Cal Tech looking for a great project, a great mentor, something to justify the confidence that had been placed in him. In the course of these troubled wanderings, he spent time in the offices of some truly interesting characters, the accounts of which offer the reader a marvelous insider's look at how science is done at one of the world's premier institutions.We meet Murray Gell-Mann, the brilliant but insecure Nobel laureate who developed the theory of quarks, yet has a continual need to impress anyone with his knowledge of linguistics and other areas unrelated to physics; John Schwarz, who works alone for many years on string theory; and Stephen Wolfram, who eats rare roast beef a pound at a time. We meet a poor soul known as the Gardener, who was given tenure too soon, was unable to do anything of value in physics and spent all his time gardening. But, mainly, we meet Feynman, again and again, as he and Mlodinow chat about all sorts of interesting things, including dying of cancer, which Mlodinow thought he might do and Feynman actually did.Mlodinow's personal story is, in its own way, every bit as interesting as Feynman's. The dust jacket mentions that he left Cal Tech to write in Hollywood for such high-powered venues as Star Trek: The Next Generation. Reading between the lines of the book, one might reasonably conclude that he continued to come up dry in his search for a project in physics and eventually left to pursue writing, another of his passions.Feynman's Rainbow offers priceless insights into the culture of science - the cranky, eccentric, very human people who do it, the quixotic way that it is done and the extraordinary passion that is required to do it well.And, as an added bonus, it is written so well that you can take it to the beach."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I'd never completed reading a book in one sitting even if it was only forty pages long. This is the first book on which I've accomplished that feat.

The book seemed more about a phase in Mlodinow's life; Feynman, Gell-Mann, Helen, and the garbageman neighbor just happened to be there at the time -- like the cast of a play. Getting an insight into physics from reading this book is like learning about bartending by watching Cheers, or medicine by watching Scrubs. It's a good, light read, reminiscent of a well-told recount of an eventful personal vacation."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"EXCELLENT!!! Gives the layman a look inside the world of Physics research, while presenting a life-lesson theme that transcends science. A great read for both science and non-science readers. I'm a Physics teacher, and the reason I love this book has absolutely NOTHING to do with science. I'm making it required reading for my Physics classes!!"},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Kudos to the Author for openly admitting to his self-doubts working as a Junior Lecturer at Caltech, his nightmares of being a one trick pony, failing to meet high standards required of him.In his memoir , the author uses the personalities of Murray and Feynman , to find his own meaning and direction in life and career. The Murray personality of concentrating on logic and order rules and logic, trying to accomplish and impress by claiming leadership, is contrasted with Feynman's way of intuition and inspiration, ignoring others expectations and maintaining an internal focus where happiness is under our own control.Aside from the wonderful Master-disciple conversations the Author has with Feynman, we get a glimpse into the troubled lives behind these Nobel prize winning Physicists. With Feynman himself suffering from Cancer, Murray losing his wife to Cancer, we also get to know a touching detail that Feynman went ahead marrying his girlfriend, inspite of her suffering from TB.This book is not only about personal lives, but also has primer on search for a theory of everything, and evolution of String Theory at Caltech Campus . Ironically Feynman, pioneer of Quantum theory, considered String theory to be a nonsense theory. It may also be pointed out that Einstein reportedly ignored Quantum theory developments during 30s and 40s, immersing himself in his unfulfilled search for unifying relativity with Electromagnetism."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"When Leonard Mlodinow was hired into the auspicious physics department at CalTech, he found himself with an office down the hall from some of the greatest minds in the field. When Nobel laureates Richard Feynman (quantum electrodynamics,1965), Murray Gell-Mann (quarks, 1969) and the man on the path to figuring the &quot;big picture&quot;, John Schwarz (string theory) are all in one department, it is understandable that a new recruit might feel a little overwhelmed. Feynman's Rainbow is the story of that overwhelming feeling and of the quest for inspiration.Fresh out of his Ph.D., Mlodinow needed focus in research and in life. His graduate thesis was very well accepted and he was lauded as a bit of a wunderkind... but what was he going to do for an encore? Centering around transcripts of taped conversa-tions he had with Feynman, and incorporating his musings with the other members of the CalTech physics department, Feynman's Rainbow is as much about the beauty in physics as it is about the search for muse. Whether the quest is for quantum mechanics, avant garde poetry or the perfect chocolate cake, inspiration is an elusive quality (as Mlodinow discovers). Feynman's Rainbow offers insights into what drives us to succeed and what compels us to search after new information and new discoveries. For students of physics, Feynman's Rainbow will validate and enthuse, but even for those who know very little about the hard science itself, this book provides enough science to pique the curiosity and enough human drama to satisfy the soul."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I was at Barnes & Noble on 5th Avenue the other day looking for a present for my daughter who just completed her vocational schooling. I also wanted to find out who was going to be the next book-signing author. On the main concourse where the bargain books were, I found instead -- to my delight -- \\"Feynman's Rainbow\\" on hardbound for $5. No, it's not by Feynman, it's about Feynman.The book was written by Leonard Mlodinow, a postdoctoral fellow who \\"shared talk, food, science, and laughter\\" during the final years of Feynman's life. Mlodinow's office was immediately beside Murray Gell-man's, who, like Feynman, was a Nobel laureate on Caltech's faculty. Murray Gell-man was the man behind the suggestion that protons, neutrons, and electrons were further made up of sub-nuclear components that he called \\"quarks\\".In only but a few words, the book gave a graspable introduction to string theory, which had its roots as a proposal to unify the four forces of nature: electromagnetism (radio, light, cellphones, etc.), gravity (general relativity), the strong force (responsible for Hiroshima's destruction), and the weak force (radioactive decay); and ended up being the potential answer to everything.I found it easy to relate to the author's narrative because the book was written in a language adapted to our times (published 2003), by an author constantly intimidated by the two titans whose offices he shared the Caltech corridors with, plus I get an un-sanitized rendition of the legend Feynman -- his genius and his eccentricities. The man's at times cold and brutal honesty was returned in kind by none other than his off-and-on friend and constant rival Murray Gell-man in his obituary. I sometimes suspect that Stephen Hawking's testimonial wherein he described the book as \\"an accessible portrait of a brilliant man,\\" was nothing more than a double-edged sword. But above all, Feynman's passion for discovery was insurmountable.Although the book's title contained Feynman's name -- and indeed covered many of his philosophies -- it was really more of the author's personal account during his tenure at Caltech. In the book one would find some intimate goings on -- politically charged at times -- within the Caltech corridors, whose electricity one does not see in more modern and contagiously upbeat cosmic books such as Brian Greene's \\"An Elegant Universe\\". IMO, although the author shared today's overly infinite and lightheaded optimism on life, his writing was clearly influenced by Feynman's probing and practical approach to seeking out the truth.I feel that the book is better read by -- perhaps event meant for -- someone who is already familiar with Feynman's works. I am not. My book is still on reserve at NYPL. At the moment, my view of Feynman is through the eyes of this other observer.The back of the book's jacket contained the highlight:...Feynman was gazing at a rainbow. As if he had never seen one before. Or maybe as if it might be his last.I approached him cautiously and joined him in staring at the rainbow. It wasn't something I normally did -- in those days.\\"Do you know who first explained the true origin of the rainbow?\\" I asked.\\"It was Descartes,\\" he said. After a moment he looked me in theeye. \\"And what do you think was the salient feature of the rainbow that inspired Descartes's mathematical analysis?\\" he asked.\\"I give up. What would you say inspired his theory?\\"\\"I would say his inspiration was that he thought rainbows werebeautiful...\\"...Oh, I got my daughter the book, \\"The Situation and the Story\\" by Vivian Gornick. And the next book-signing author will be Michael Connelly."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Often times in my graduate school years I've wondered whether I had what it takes to become a successful researcher. Back then it appeared to me as if there were too many bright people working on similar topics. It didn't help either that my own advisor seemed to understand everything I asked the moment he heard about them. No, he was not someone who would discourage his students in any way. To the contrary he had always been supportive and encouraging. Yet the uncertainties of the future kept me questioning myself on my own qualifications.This is an utterly honest recollection of the author's first year experience as faculty at Caltech. Getting a faculty position in physics at Caltech is no small achievement, nevertheless the author finds himself pondering over the exact same questions. The author tries to find out however, seeking advice from others surrounding him. Of course amongst the others was Feynman, and the author makes great efforts -- for example sneaking pass the department's secretary to gain access to Feynman's office -- to seek Feynman's advice.Packing to move never fails to bring about memories of the past for me. The book, acknowledgedly based on cassette tape recordings the author made during his encounters with Feynman, and found in the author's garage many years thereafter, evokes similar emotions. Mlodinow earned his learning. It would have been great consolation had I read the book back in my school days.Addendum 1. Don't be fooled by Stephen Hawking's review \\"An accessible portrait of a brilliant man\\" at the back cover of the book. I suspect that Hawking never read the book. As alluded, the book is not solely about Feynman.Addendum 2.

There are no insights here into Feynman's character, or his personality, or the incredible story of his marriage to Arline. Nope, this book is mostly the author boasting about graduating early, writing a well-respected thesis, and being expected to excel. It should have been called \\"Mlodinow's Rainbow\\" but I guess that wouldn't have sold as many copies, would it?Don't get me wrong. The book is entertaining enough, and short enough (171 pages of large type) to be quickly devoured in a single sitting. Just don't expect there to be anything of substance about the name in the title, which is obviously a marketing ploy."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"The book is mainly about the author.

This was exactly what I wanted, and it was what I got. Mlodinow makes the themes of physics approachable--partly, I think, by only giving you what you need to know for his fleshing out of the characters and pursuits and worldviews (I enjoyed the Greek/Babylonian contrast) of Feynman, Gell-Mann (sp?), himself, and various other physicists. But it's also about life, as you will have deduced from the title. It's nothing soul-searchingly profound--not quite, at least--but it is sensitive and human. I could sympathize with Mlodinow's trepidation at being asked to work at Caltech; the worries and struggles, mostly with himself, to get where he was going--to find out, even, where he was going.Feynman comes across as a guy you would have liked to meet, if you could stand having your cliches boxed out of you. I did not like so much the passages where Mlodinow gives us his words verbatim. Sometimes I got the ideas behind them and occasionaly liked them -- but they are written in a conversational style which sometimes seemed awkward. But they were, after all, the man's words, and one could not have expected Mlodinow to doctor them I suppose.Anyway, I recommend this book, but I doubt I will be re-reading it. Though who knows. It was so short, easy, and concisely satisfying, that maybe a couple of years from now I'll give it another go."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"It is an easy and fun read. Having said that I should point several disappointments. First, the backcover implies that the author knew Feynman fairly well. After reading the book one understands that the author is almost a total stranger to Feynman. They have very few, short, sporadic chats but that is it. This hurts the credibility of the author's claim that he understands Feynman's search in life. Second, the emphasis on author's insecurities about his academic capabilities are too hard to understand and almost irritating. Third, Murray Gell-Mann is the villain in the book just because he has very common personality traits that most of the famous scientists share. Fourth, Helen character as the department secretary is hard to believe. No administrative person in any university has such a power on a young professor that she/he can prevent him/her to consult fellow scientists. Finally, half Greek half Italian handsome postdoc fellow is in the book to fill some space. He is too obvious as a fiction trick. His character lacks the depth."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"This book has nothing to do with Feynman, it is a book in which the author boast about what he did in his PhD thesis and tries to justify his choices of not doing science full-time (perhaps because not good enough.. don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad in it). I find pathetic the way the author uses Feynman's name to get attention and selling books. Not worth the money."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Caltech is the home of some of the best minds in physics. Most notable physicists on its faculty included Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann; both are Nobel laureates. The author narrates in simple words his casual interactions with Richard Feynman when he (author) was a freshman-faculty member at the physics department. Feeling unsettled in the world of giants, he looks for guidance and direction to establish his career, and in the process learns some basic lessons about being a person, and a physicist. Feynman is a legend in physics world, and was considered as Einstein of modern times until his death in 1988. He was known for discovery of quantum electrodynamics, a theory of the electromagnetic force that governs the behavior of electrons that orbit the nucleus of the atom.Academics is a dog-eat-dog world; if you can't create something new in physics, you could be walking out of the door sooner than latter. This is true at all top colleges and research institutions. This is painfully clear to a new faculty member, and the author expresses this fear in spite of the fact that his PhD thesis at UC Berkeley is a significant contribution, in his own rights, in physics. Feynman was the first one to detect this unsettling behavior; at that time Feynman was 63 and terminally ill with cancer. Feynman loved life, dressed and spoke like a blue-collar Joe, with no sophistication in his style. He lounged around strip clubs to do his physics, experimented with controlled substances and once crashed into a wedding party to freeload on buffet in casual cloths when all the invited guests were dressed in suits and dresses. He didn't drink and he was faithful to his wife. Both Feynman and Gell-Mann looked down on biologists, chemists, and physicists who applied physics rather than discover fundamental laws. Seminars at Caltech had the reputation for its brutality because Gell-Mann could nag the speaker for the tiniest point, and if the seminar is uninteresting he would read a newspaper. Feynman was equally brash and unwilling to respect sloppy ideas in physics. The combination of Gell-Mann and Feynman were highly intimidating. Feynman was diligent in avoiding any activity that he did not find interesting. He could be abrupt and abrasive. Gell-Mann was a show-off; he was a know-it-all type. Feynman and Gell-Mann were both friends and enemies.The author briefly describes early work done on String theory at Caltech by John Schwartz: This was the time when String theory was at its infancy. He gets discouraged to work in this field by the negative reaction of both Gell-Mann and Feynman. He seriously considers working with Schwartz but his own doubts about the theory forces the author to loose confidence in himself. Sometimes the author feels \\"small\\" to walk on the footsteps of giants, but he also shows that great physicists are also human and do crazy things like normal people.1.Some Time with Feynman (Penguin Press Science)2.The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives3.Euclid's Window : The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace4.Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!

He seems to enjoy expressing his feelings, particularly anguish and happiness, for physics. During his time at Caltech he learned much from his Mentor, Richard Feynman, and he recounts that year very well with many recorded conversations quoted directly. I believe that Mlodinow wrote this book in hopes of inspiring others as Feynman inspired him. His approach to physics is similar to Feynman's and his ability to explain his view is done with ease and so informally that you feel as though you are simply catching up with a friend you haven't seen for a while.The way in which Mlodinow shows the faults as well as successes of the characters, including him, in the book make it an enjoyable and very valid account. The physics talk is so well explained that even a person who hasn't the slightest inkling what a theory or force is can understand and follow his train of thought. This book makes physics and physicist seem less surreal and more congenial. Mlodinow's journey through life and Feynman's previously untraveled path to genius are inspiring and engagingly written about. I recommend this book for any and all who enjoy learning about questions, answers, and the people who formulate them."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Want to feel good in spite of today's headlines? Have you got an hour to spare? Then head to the nearest Chapters or Indigo, reach for the slim Feynman's Rainbow, and settle into one of those plush chairs, gracefully provided by the chain store. You are in for an exciting 60-minute journey of discovery that no television show can emulate.Feynman's Rainbow is really the diary of the first year in the life of a particle physicist, freshly emerging from graduate school, as he settles in at one of the most illustrious research institutes in the world. Yet, when young Leonard Mlodinow began his first-year fellowship at the California Institute of Technology, the only thing he was sure of was that the letter of invitation had been sent to the wrong guy. Insecure about himself, uncertain about his future, Mlodinow turned to Richard Feynman (1918-1988), one of the titans of physics at the time, and a star in the Cal Tech firmament. Feynman's Rainbow is the story of the relationship between the two men, of what started as physics discussions in the seminar room and soon developed into a lifelong friendship as the two explored their views about science, life and the universe.Mlodinow had actually encountered Feynman some time earlier. In the winter of 1973, as the effects of the Yom Kippur war dragged on, foreign volunteers made their way to Israel to work in several front-line settlements, replacing soldiers on reserve duty. Young Mlodinow was one of them. At night there was little to do, he remembers, except to chat with the other volunteers, look at the stars or visit the small kibbutz library. Among the few books in English was a paperback, The Character of Physical Law, a transcript of some lectures Feynman had given in the '60s, and The Feynman Lectures on Physics, a three-volume set with a picture of the author, an action shot of a happy fellow playing bongo drums.For Mlodinow, who had a double major in chemistry and mathematics at the time, the books proved to be his first real introduction to physics. \\"These books were unlike any textbooks I had seen,\\" he remembers. \\"They were chatty. They were amusing, but more importantly, they made physics sound important, as if a physicist with an idea could single-handedly change the world and the way people view it. . . . Later I found myself thinking over problems and issues from Feynman's books as I drove the tractor hauling chicken eggs.\\" By the time he landed back in Chicago that summer, Mlodinow had decided physics would be his choice for a career.Now, 10 years later, Mlodinow was in Cal Tech as one of the youngest postdoctoral fellows in the history of the institution, with complete freedom to study whatever he liked. Down the hall were two Nobel Prize winners, Richard Feynman and, next door, Murray Gell-Mann.If one could chart the scientific landscape along the lines of Saul Steinberg's classic New Yorker cover showing the relationship of New York to the rest of the country, then particle physics with Feynman and Gell-Mann would occupy Manhattan. The surrounding areas, off in New Jersey somewhere, would then represent mathematics and other areas of theoretical physics, and, last, away off in the plains and on the far coast would be some tiny structures -- applied physics, life science. Mlodinow decided to stick to Manhattan with Feynman and Gell-Mann.Gell-Mann's most famous achievement, so far, had been to propose, in the early 1960s, an elegant mathematical system classifying all elementary particles as particular combinations of quarks. Individual quarks had never been seen, but, eventually, other physicists began to accept Gell-Mann's ideas which, besides earning him a Nobel Prize, conferred on him enormous prestige as one of the most influential scientists of the postwar era. Yet, there was, at that time, a major controversy in physics: If quarks cannot be isolated, what sense does it make to talk about them, besides helping to bestow a sense of order on the universe.Feynman used to say that there were two kinds of physicists, the Babylonians and the Greeks. The Babylonians made civilization's first great strides in understanding numbers and equations, but it was the Greeks whom we credit with inventing mathematics.Put simply, the Babylonians focused on the phenomenon, the Greeks on the underlying order. Feynman considered himself a Babylonian; Gell-Mann was more the Greek type, wanting to categorize nature and impose an efficient mathematical order on the underlying data. Our culture is a culture that, by Feynman's characterization, is Greek. It is a culture of logic, rules and order, in which people like Feynman are considered eccentric -- yet are able, eventually, to take the greatest strides in original creativity or, as we say today, \\"to think outside the box.\\"Feynman's Rainbow is a slim book, and its author saves the important questions for the end. \\"What is important in life?,\\" he asks. Here again, Gell-Mann, the ambitious organizer, and Feynman, the free-spirited mentor, joust. Gell-Mann's aim in life was to accomplish and to impress, to be an important person and a leader. \\"For me,\\" Mlodinow admits, \\"this ambition was like chasing a rainbow. Even worse, like chasing other people's rainbows, whose beauty I didn't really see.\\"For Feynman, physics and life were ruled by intuition and inspiration, and this freedom from convention is what inspired Mlodinow to escape the narrowness of his own academic life. \\"Once I shed the burden of the real and imagined expectations of others, it was easy to tell where my passions lay. If Feynman could see beauty as the inspiration for the theory of the rainbow, so could I.\\"And so Mlodinow soon left the office next to Gell-Mann to settle in the New Jersey plains, where he pursued the research he liked, optical physics -- the physics of the rainbow -- and began a happy second career as a writer.Feynman's Rainbow is not a book that provides answers, and yet it is a comforting book. How many people do we know for whom physics conjures painful high-school memories? Have they got an hour to spare? For them, this book would be a surprisingly rewarding gift."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"This slight book is part autobiography and part parasitism on the Feynman legend. If you know nothing about Feynman, start by watching a couple of the BBC videos of him, so you get a sense of his voice, accent, mannerisms, and infectious interest in science. Then, with that imprinted, read \\"Surely You're Joking, . . .\\" and after that move on to his \\"Lectures on Physics.\\" You will then know enough to tackle his other available work. If you still have an appetite for the man behind the scientist, read Gleick's bio or the selection of his letters that his daughter edited. Mlodinow may have an interesting story to tell about his life, but not in this fashion."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"This book is not really about Fernmann but about the author's stay at Caltech. For example, many entire chapters are devoted to characters other than Feynmann.Its negative points include:- Writing style with clich&eacute;s (e.g., most chapters end with a catchy phrase and begin with a long description)- Misleading title- Several misinterpretations of what Feynmann's say- Fiction mixed with reality (some events and characters were altered)- Lack of a closer relationship of the author with Feynmann limit the author's insight into Feynmann's character.I would not necessarily recommend this book to a physics student without some warnings. Many successful graduates later become what the authors calls \\"one-tricky ponies\\". The author himself left physics in spite of a brilliant Ph.D. dissertation after which he had this stay at Caltech and another fellowship later in Munich, Germany.There is a different path that this book may not motivate a student to follow when hardships come. But the author's honesty with himself and his experiences as well the insights he gives makes this book a very good reading.

Or is it that Feynman's mythic power and personality still deeply resonate years after his death? All I want to say is that this memoir from an earlier time in Mlodinow's life opens a window to the process of discovery in science and in individuals. It recalls a crucial period for the author, who was at a crossroad and was looking for guidance. Feynman guides by not guiding, and by holding up a mirror to Mlodinow. I also enjoyed the understandable explanations of scientific theories, the discussions of string theory, and the clear presentation of Babylonian/Grecian world views.This book is well worth reading for both the nonscientist and the scientist, and for all those young people seeking to find their place in the world."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I'm tempted to describe this book as self help for PhD's with fear of failure, though perhaps that's a bit uncharitable.Mlodinow describes his troubles starting new physics research at lofty CalTech after his PhD dissertation, a year of soul-searching and insecurity about his abilities. In search of a mentor, he had several conversations with Feynman and had the foresight to record these, at a time when Feynman wasn't a public celebrity yet.The result is a mixture of an abbreviated personal diary, accounts of the atmosphere and personalities at CalTech, simplified descriptions of the physics involved (e.g. string theory), and some conversations with Feynman. Note that the latter make up only a fraction of the book.If you're looking to learn more about Feynman, there's not a lot of new material here. If you're curious to read his advice to a promising young physicist, this book may be for you. It's well-written, engaging, and a quick read."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I enjoyed this book for several reasons:1.

He interjects his own bit of humor, coupled with his curious thoughts on everything from his own self-doubts to theoretical physics! As for some of the other reviewers that feel misled by the title of this book...I do not! This book is not about Feynman per se, it is about a person's struggle (Mlodinow's) with various problems in his life and how others have helped him along his journeys in life. Feynman does play a significant role indeed, although he is not the entire focus of the book. Anyone who enjoys reading about Feynman or science, should enjoy this one!

Mlodinow addresses issues that every budding scientist must deal with in his or her own way, and I would personally recommend that anyone exploring a career in science read this.The book explores a lot of common misconceptions about scientists and specifically, physicists, by following Mlodinow's own personal story. In this way he manages to show the reader some of the more common pitfalls of the young science enthusiast in ways that could be life-changing to the right people. I only wish I had read this as a student at MIT; perhaps it wouldn't have been so difficult for me to arrive where I am if I had that opportunity back then."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I've always been a fan of Feynman and had looked forward to reading this book. What a disappointment. The book turns out to be mostly about the author's own years at Caltech, with ill-fitting bits of his conversations with Feynman wedged in between. He tries a little too hard to interpret Feynman's intentions in every little phrase, perhaps due to the lack of material since he knew Feynman merely as a colleague. And really he misinterprets in a lot of the cases, making a fuss where there isn't much. I get the feeling that either he selected his stories poorly due to his lack of understanding of why Feynman was great, or he simply did not have anything better to offer but still used Feynman's name in the title for marketing purposes. The book may sell better as a result but it'll be at the unjustifiable expense of diminishing Feynman.Another problem I have with this book is that it's written to appear as if it's nonfiction. Yet the preface states, \\"The book...is not a novel...But I have combined and altered events...I have altered names and personalities in order to best portray my experience.\\" Pardon me but, how is this not a novel again? Hearing this sort of nonsense from a theoretical scientist is worrisome."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I was moderately disappointed by the book. It held great promise, as I've an active interest in Richard Feynman, and have been reading several \\"find yourself\\" books, so a story that connects the two should have been perfect. Should have.The annecdotes of dealing with Feynman as he coped with cancer were touching, and Feynman's downsides (example: Feynman's reluctance to help former students of his after an obligatory two year period) were uniquely captured here. Despite that, the writing on him and the relations were very thin. Indeed, Murray Gelman had as big a place in Mlodinow's life.In the end, we're left with a story of a sharp mind (Mlodinow) who struggles with his desire to be a physicist. Unfortunately we are given too little on both his final decisions as well as the titular interactions with Feynman."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Well, this book makes an evening of good reading. Feynman fans would instantly identify with his vintage mannerisms such as scorn for psychology and philosophy, showmanship and his wonder of nature. It contains Feynman's views of how a scientists life should be, how he must go about choosing problems and the emphasis that he must lay on his belief of his capabilities and the problems tractability.But, more than all the above, this book is about the authors struggles with high expectations. He portrays the emotional lows that graduate students and fresh graduates undergo when they step out to the real world. It tells you that no matter how smart you are, which school you went to, or the quality of work you produce, there would always be moments of self doubt. Feynman himself faced such fallow times more than once, even after he won the Nobel.Surprisingly, the author does not mention that Feynman went through exactly the same dilemma when he got out of Los Alamos. He was being offered positions with high salary from Berkeley, Institute of Advanced Study, Cornell etc. Feynman felt that he did not deserve these posts as he would not produce any good work any more in his life. How he got over this feeling is a wonderful story in itself.Overall, I guess the book is worth buying if you are interested in the life of a scientist in general, especially a young one."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"There were plenty of famous physicists in the twentieth century, but none as endearing and downright funny as Richard Feynman. If you have ever read his wonderful memoir _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_, you know plenty about the humorous side of the serious physicist, the man who originated quantum electrodynamics as well as plenty of other accomplishments within his field, to say nothing of playing the bongos. Now there is an unusual memoir, a tribute from a young physicist who came within Feynman's orbit at Caltech in the early 1980s. _Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life_ (Warner Books) by Leonard Mlodinow gives us another snapshot of Feynman, which would always be welcome, but this one is special. Mlodinow was starting up to be an academic physicist, and got to get advice from Feynman on the task, as well as on what is important in life. Mlodinow presciently taped many of the sessions, and got around to transcribing them only recently. Feynman has lots to teach us still, even if we aren't physicists.Part of the attraction of this little volume is that while it is about Feynman, it is also about Mlodinow's discomfort as a whiz kid brought in to work at Caltech. He was glad to get the appointment, but also intimidated. &quot;These people at Caltech might actually expect something of me.&quot; He didn't know how to start, and floundered for months, until he decided to talk with Feynman, just down the hall, about what he thought about string theory. &quot;Look,&quot; Feynman said dismissively, &quot;If you really believed in string theory, you wouldn't come here asking me. You'd come here _telling_ me.&quot; The lesson was, find something you believe in and go to work. In Feynman's view, it wouldn't do to work on just anything. If you weren't working on something beautiful, and something you believed in, then the work wouldn't be fun. And fun was essential: &quot;For me, physics is more fun than anything else or I couldn't be doing it.&quot; Feynman isn't the only curious character in this memoir. Next door to Mlodinow's office is another Nobel winner, Murray Gell-Mann who had brought the unifying theory of quarks to subatomic particles. John Schwarz, working alone for many years, finally brings out string theory. Stephen Wolfram appears, before &quot;Mathematica&quot; and his own rewrite of science, to eat a pound of rare roast beef. There is also a good deal of science in the book, a brief summary of where physics stood at the end of the millennium.Mlodinow had a hobby of writing during the time, writing screenplays, which some of his fellow physicists must have thought beneath him. Feynman didn't influence him directly to go into writing, but at least partially because of Feynman's teaching about going after the work that is fun, he wound up writing rather than doing physics. He left Caltech to write an acclaimed history of geometry, and even scripts for _Star Trek_. It is obvious he absorbed the lessons he has generously shared with us in this amusing book, for he left Caltech hoping that he could do something Feynman would admire. &quot;And then I thought, no, even better, I hope that someday I will write something that I would admire.&quot; Very nice work, Mr. Feynman."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"This is a short book, which is good because there's really not a lot of meat to it. It consists of the author's recollections of his uncertainty about his early career and his qualifications to be a physics researcher, interspersed with conversations with Richard Feynman and observations about Murray Gell-Mann. The book would have been better had it focused more on Feynman and Gell-Mann and less on the author's dope-smoking, garbage-collector friend Ray.It appears the author left the physics field, due to some combination of losing interest in it and being unable to find a research project that would justify his hiring by Caltech. He later wrote a screenplay that was never made into a movie (I believe thousands of people have done that); co-wrote a mediocre episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation; wrote a book I haven't yet read on the history of geometry; and wrote this modest book. All of this probably means he's accomplished more of note than I have, but probably considerably less than he had hoped as a young physics Ph.D."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Richard Feynman and Gell-Man Murray are two towering figures in 20th Century Physics. The book begins with the writer's arrival at Caltech as a fresh postdoc with a PhD from Berkeley in the 1980s. In this little autobiographical book, the author writes about his experiences at Caltech focusing on his interactions with Feynman and Murray - their characters and rivalry. Physics take a back seat in this book. Instead, the author attempts to tell a very human (and sometimes sad) story about himself, Feynman and Murray. I find this book interesting for two reasons. First, the author shares his experience about the insecurities that many PhD graduates have about their ability to do meaningful research work after the PhD (especially when one's PhD work was considered important enough to land a Caltech postdoc). Second, it provides a few glimpses of what Feynman and Murray were like at close range - human beings observed on a daily basis (and at their natural habitat). Overall, I cannot help but get the feeling that Feynman comes across as a more 'humane' person than Murray in this book. The writer doesn't apologize for his bias towards Feynman and he does gives examples of Murray's generosity (e.g. his support and belief on Schwartz who toiled for years with the String Theory). He repeatedly emphasizes on the different styles and outlook (life philosophy) of Feynman and Murray. Feynman is more interested in interesting problems and derives tremendous joy from doing physics. Murray, the smart one who revels in demonstrating his diverse knowledge. At the end, the writer favours Feynman's approach to life partly because of his own interests and inclination - towards writing.

It is a good read, and it is entertaining, especially to those interested in the daily workings of a major physics departments. The advice Mlodinow received from Feynman on life and work is very useful to everyone who reads it.However the book is also quite misleading. First, the title and back cover suggest strongly that this is a book about Feynman. It isn't. It is about a junior faculty member who on occasion would talk to Feynman. Second, the book itself goes into great detail describing the people at Caltech, but then has a disclaimer that except for the exact quotes from Feynman, most of the characters and stories are not accurate. Several people have been combined to produce characters, others sound fictional.The third criticism is that Mlodinow hypes himself too much. Throughout the book he talks about his great research into infinit dimensions and quantum optics. He talks about being well known for his graduate thesis, and for correcting mistakes in well known theories. However amongst other physicists who were active at the time, almost no one has actually heard of him. And looking through citations in research papers from the era reveal very few references to his work.It is worth reading, but as a biography of Mlodinow, not as an accurate historical portrayal of Feynman, Gell-Mann, or Caltech."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I've been a Feynman fan since back in the 60s. I've read most of the popular books about Feynman and by Feynman, as well as some of his technical ones. Although this book's principle character is the author, there are many interesting snippets from the last few years of Feynman's life. This is a very pleasant book. In addition to containing painless discussions on the work of theoretical physicists, it shows that even the greatest scientific giants have their weak points that make them as human as the rest of us. The book is very well written and in an engaging style that makes it difficult to put down.

He describes well the difficulties faced by a talented and promising young adult trying to form his worldview and choose his life/career goals and direction. Many people, not just budding physicists, will be able to relate to this, and indeed I think that is the main value of the book.In the course of the book, he presents some physics discussions and reflections on the philosophy of science/physics, and of course he also provides some information about Feynman (and Gell-Mann), but none of this is in great depth, so it's best regarded as \\"bonus\\" material.Overall, I can highly recommend this book to anyone with a little background in modern physics, and some familiarity with Feynman and Gell-Mann's biographies and work. The book is very enjoyably written, so reading it is time well spent. I enjoyed the book so much that I will be checking out Mlodinow's other books also."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"These reviews are longer than this book, which is 171 pages long and written by a physicist who later became a writer for &quot;Star Trek.&quot; It's about discovery. Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann each had a different approach to physics, and a different way of looking at the world. In the end, Gell-Mann taught Feynman string theory because, despite his love for theory, Gell-Mann's instincts had led him to recognize that theory's potential when everyone else thought of it as a joke, while Feynman's instincts, unerring in so many cases, had in this one instance, apparently, been wrong.The rivalry between Gell-Mann and Feynman, and their apparent reconciliation at the end of Feynman's life, embodies the narrator's personal struggle and that conflict's eventual resolution. Unsure of his abilities, seeking a problem on which to work, Mlodinow learns that, in both physics and life, you find your path by heeding, not &quot;customs and rules,&quot; but your own internal voice. That voice may lead to a &quot;big picture&quot; such as a unified field theory, or to the physics of a rainbow or a mental voyage on the U.S.S. Enterprise. Yet all discoveries, both large and small, scientific and uniquely personal, come about as the result following your passion. Mldodinow asked Feynman: what problem should I pursue? Feynman taught him that the answer to this question was one that he had always already known.This book does not take one hour to read: it takes two. Both of them are worth it."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"The book jacket made me worry that the book was going to be a namby pamby \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" affair :-) because the jacket said something about \\"a young physicist [author Mlodinow] trying to find his place in the world, and .. the famous, old, and dying colleague whose wisdom helped him\\". Luckily, \\"Feynman's Rainbow\\" turns out to be more fun and light and memorable and show-don't-tell than the Morrie book, although there is a slight resemblance.The best feature of the book is that it lets the reader feel what it's like for an \\"ordinary\\" person to be around greatness and around history. There are plenty of serious books about the giants, and they might even include a few quotes from neighbors or secretaries about the giants, but this book actually lets the reader *feel* what it's like to live with the great, day after day, in an interesting Rosencrantz-and-Guildenstern way as described below in (1). In that sense, the fact that the book is actually about the author and only peripherally about Feynman is part of it's charm. So, the main character's (author's) \\"I'm finding myself\\" phase of life is slightly tedious in the book, true, but the tedium actually works to give a being-there/slice-of-life appeal, and I wouldn't complain about it. For example, the slumping main character's (author's) slight confusedness and whininess makes a context that allows Feynman to be impatient with him in (a more gentle version of) Don-Corleone's \\"&lt;slap>, what's the matter with you?\\" way.(1) My favorite parts of the book are actually the stuff in the background of the book's story--e.g., backdrop stuff like the sad-sack string-theory nutjob (!) Schwarz who was pitied and ridiculed by everyone (even grad students) at Caltech and who was allowed to remain on the faculty (but with no tenure) only due to the support of his single high-profile supporter in the Physics faculty. Such backdrop parts of the book have a lovely Rosencrantz & Guildenstern feel to them because they invert the usual ordering of the big picture (e.g., string theory) and the little picture (Mlodinow's mundane concerns). Stephen Wolfram also makes a cameo. Such backdrop parts may be especially enjoyable to readers who have some existing knowledge of physics. (Physics = Hamlet, in the analogy.)(2) Other great not-quite-foreground parts of the book involve Feynman, of course, and/or Murray Gell-Mann. Feynman is familiar to most readers. But what an interesting guy is Gell-Mann! The book made me want to read his books and biography next. His relationship with Feynman is so awesome and is discussed at various points in the book. The single-sentence (or so) description of how Gell-Mann and Feynman spent their time together in Feynman's last months is very touching, like something out of a movie. A great, great movie or book can be made on the yin and yang and the relationship between these two guys. [Maybe one has already been made; I don't know.] The relationship in the hypothetical movie would resemble that portrayed between Salieri and Mozart in the movie \\"Amadeus\\", but with Salieri's being just as much of a genius (but of an opposite type) as Mozart, and with Salieri's being mostly not evil. Pitch to the studios: \\"'Grumpy Old Men', starring Amadeus and a genius version of Salieri\\". :-)(3) And what makes the book work, that can keep things light, are the goofy little anecdotes. Not knee-slappingly funny or anything, but nice. Here's an example. Feynman and the author, both hungry and casually-dressed, see a wedding reception at Caltech's Athenaeum and crash in to get fed. When asked whether they are from the bride's side or the groom's side, Feynman replies, \\"We represent the Physics Department\\". Ha ha. By the way, the quote evinces a great, jaunty attitude and therefore is a good slogan for life (that anyone can adopt, with appropriate substitution for \\"Physics Department\\").Finally, let's note that the book is breezily good but should not be read with high expectations because it is not and does not try to be the \\"great\\" type of book."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I read Feynman's Rainbow at a time when I was reading a lot of books about science and physics and learning about how interesting and funny Feynman was as a person (his two autobiographies come very highly recommended by me). While mostly diving head-first into the fascinating but dry world of quantum physics, this book came as a refreshing change of pace from my usual non-fiction fare: an honest, heartfelt memoir whose cast of characters just happened to include one of my favorite scientists/people of all time. It touches on Feynman's philosophical side as he faces the inevitable, premature end to his own life and shows the impact he has on a wide-eyed but unsure author.Well-written, highly entertaining, and a very easy/enjoyable read.

Archimedes was also a visual scientist, he taught by drawing on a sand table (The Archimedes Codex by Reviel Netz and William Noel). I like how great minds often \\"see\\" reality rather than writing out thousands of equations. There are multiple ways of figuring out the universe.A good corollary to this reading experience is \\"What do you care what other people think?\\", Feynman's last collected book.

Here he recounts how he met the big names in physics and how they affected his life and decisions. His main influence was Richard Feynman,who besides being a brilliant physicist was notorious for being honest,outspoken, frank, with no respect for authority. He compares Feynman with another nobel laureate he met at Caltech Murray Gell-Mann (who was his opposite in many ways) and their feisty relationship with each other.The book is very well written, honest, down to earth and brings out the warmth and humanity in the people portrayed, especially Feynman. It will strike a chord with everyone who has had doubts about their career path in life."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I had read about Feynman only in books written by him, or through his published lectures. This was the first book I read about Feynman from the perspective of somebody who knew him first hand, more specifically as a junior, in some sense a mentee. I enjoyed reading about the author's honest portrayal of the insecurities he faced as a kid just out of college and his interactions with Feynman in an indirect effort to overcome those."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Feynman's Rainbow is an autobiographical account of Leonard Mlodinow's first year after getting his Ph.D., which he spent at CalTech (1981-1982). His office happened to be between that of legendary and Nobel Prize winning physicists Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann, and Mlodinow tells a few stories about interacting with the two. The conversations with Feynman were taped and are transcribed in the book, and it is interesting to hear many of his thoughts and thought processes, on everything from particle physics to the eponymous rainbow. The emphasis of the book isn't Feynman, but rather Mlodinow, as he struggles with self-doubt and trying to find a research project as a young post-doc. If you are looking for something specifically about Feynman, you might want to skip this.Mlodinow produces ground-breaking work for his Ph.D. dissertation, and receives a fellowship at CalTech because of it. As is common to most young Ph.D.'s, Mlodinow suffers a bit of a dry spell and falls into thinking that he won't be able to repeat his previous successes. Having switched from math and chemistry to physics upon reading one of Feynman's books, Mlodinow hopes to be taken under Feynman's wing as he begins his career as a scientist. Occasional hilarities ensue, but we do get to learn about different philosophical approaches to physics (manifested in the logical \\"Greek\\" Gell-Mann and the intuitive \\"Babylonian\\" Feynman), which also transcend to life experiences like the death of a loved one and career choices. I thought the most interesting parts of the book were the discussion what it means to be a scientist, and why they do what they do.I would recommend the book mostly to students of science. Feynman was an interesting and influential character that non-scientists would enjoy, and I don't think that the details of string theory presented in the book were too confusing. I enjoyed the stories, and made me feel a little better about my own self-doubts I'm having in graduate school right now...not that I'm going to give it up and pursue writing for TV shows like the author."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Rating: 4.5 stars (out of 5) July 14, 2003The author of the book is the writer of Star Trek: The Next Generation. I have always wondered about the man behind the scenes who created the story of Star Trek: TNG. The book described the time he spent as a young promising scientist at Caltech. He was offered a job at Caltech as a freelance scientist, where he was told by the chairman that he could work on anything he wanted. The implication was that he was expected to deliver earth-shattering results in the same calibre as those of the esteemed scientists in the department. Such pressure turned out to be crushing and he decided to seek advice from someone down the hall, the Nobel Prize winner and iconoclast Richard Feynman.This book is so easy to read that I finished reading in one day. I walked into a bookstore on a Saturday afternoon, picked up this book, and read from page 1 to page 123. Then I bought the book, went home and finished the rest in the same evening. The writing in this book is both witty and heart-warming. At times, the author is so witty that I laughed out aloud at several places. \\"Descartes never got up before noon. He must have been a pioneer in this tradition because people didn't understand and it earned him the reputation of being lazy. Still, he managed to revolutionize the fields of physics, mathematics, and philosophy. Not bad for a lazy guy.\\" [p.125]Although mixed with bits and pieces of science explained carefully enough that anyone can understand them, they are actually the minor features in the book. The book reads like a novel and through the 2 characters of Murray and especially Feynman, it sheds some insight about the attitude of scientists. Feynman is portrayed here not only as a super genius in physics, which of course he is, but rather as a Socrates who guides the author to find his own answers to the inquiry of science and life. The one insight from Feynman that I find most memorable is about the psychological aspect: he would convince himself that he must have an inside track in the problem so that all the other guys would have no chance, much like when the Africians go to war, and they beat drums and get themselves excited.I cannot help but to wonder that Feynman is shown almost like Captain Picard of the Enterprise in Star Trek. Perhaps this resemblance motivated the writer to create the character of Picard when he later became a writer in Hollywood."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely and feel that it adds another facet to an overall portrait of Richard Feynman. No one book is ever going to have it all, the physics, the bio, the insight, but this adds a very appealing view from one who was at least on the same floor at CalTech as Feynman himself. As the Zen Master said, it is when something is dying that it is the greatest teacher and in this book Feynman is dying but he's going out the same way as he lived and there is a lot to be learned from him. He gives the author a push toward living in his own skin and finding his own path and does it with the directness that always characterized Feynman. Words to live by? When Feynman tells Leonard that if he's unhappy he should think about that but that when he's happy just let it be and on't question it."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I would only read it if you want another view at Feynman's life.

But the narrative lacks Mitch Album's powerful, poignant voice and the content will alienate anyone who doesn't understand the basics of quantum physics (which I have no problem admitting is a group that includes me).This book's target audience is definitely those in the science fields. I consider myself a fairly sharp and inquisitive individual, but I can't follow a book that dissects the different approaches to quantifying and measuring the movement of those unidentified sub-atomic particles most scientists believe exist. The book contains lines similar to \\"while person X subscribed to the Greek philosophy of scientific study, person Y was more of a Babylonian thinker.\\" Uh...ok.The prose reminds me of undergraduate fiction workshops. The problem with books like this is that the author lived through an experience that many people would want to read about but doesn't have the skills himself to transform it into an interesting read. His training is in Math, Chemistry and Physics. Mlodinow picking up the pen and trying to become an author would be like Toni Morrison trying to design NASA's next rocket. His opening description of the dying Feyman returning to class after an operation is so full of clich&eacute;s and melodrama, I almost stopped there...and now, I wish I had."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Don't buy this book thinking it's about Feynman; it's really all about the author, a whiny sycophant who attached himself to Feynman at Caltech while the professor worked in his final years. Mlotinow offers precious little from Feynman, while going on interminably about his inability to find a purpose in his work, his pot-smoking buddies and an especially excruciating bit about a false-positive testicular cancer diagnosis. The few-and-far-between anecdotes and quotes from Feynman are nuggets, but there's really nothing here that can't be found in Surely You're Joking or What Do You Care What Other People Think.If you're looking for information about and from Richard Feynman, read the two titles listed above. If you want to find out about quantum theory or string theory, read The Whole Shebang by Timothy Ferris or The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene. Take a pass on this one."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"Alright... So the title doesn't accurately reflect how much of the book is not about Feynman. That's a minor point to me, as is the Babylonian and Greek approaches to physics, which was explained quite adequately in the book and to me made perfect sense.If anyone had bothered to read the back cover of the book, they would have understood the nature of the book:\\"In the early 1980s, Leonard Mlodinow came to the California Institute of Technology to begin a postdoctoral fellowship. Afraid he was not smart enough to be there in spite of his groundbreaking Ph.D. thesis, he took his insecurities to Richard Feynman, Calthech's intimidating resident genius and iconoclast. And so began a pivotal year of awakening in a young man's life...\\"This is what the book is about. It's more about the author and his relationship with Feynman than about Feynman and his relationship to the author. There's a big difference in the two perspectives.Mlodinow was young and insecure when he went to Caltech. Who wouldn't be intimidated by the brainpower in that physics department? Feynman and Gell-Mann, both Nobel Prize winners, would intimidate just about anyone. However, if I had skipped a year in college and graduated with 3 majors - Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics (not to mention a ground-breaking theory under my belt while I was in my early-to-mid twenties) - I think I would be pretty secure in my intellectual abilities.Be that as it may, the book is about a yound man's journey to discover the meaning of his life. It took Feynman, though, to make Mlodinow understand that he had to do what was right and fun for him and no one else. Feynman never came out and gave Mlodinow any definitive answers. He let Mlodinow discover his own way.I thought the book was very enjoyable and, as others found, a very quick read. I read a good deal of it in the evenings as I was brushing my teeth. (OK... Maybe TMI there.)I was taken with the clarity of Mlodinow's writing and, particularly, the cadence of Feynman's sentences. Simple. Direct.There are nuggets sprinkled throughout the book if you care to read the book that deeply. You only have to read and have an open mind."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"A lover of physics, I always have enjoyed reading biographical or semi-biographical works of physics revolutionaries that give insight into the brilliance and often eccentricity that they exhibited in their everyday lives. Of all the famous physics personae, few are surrounded with as much wonder and legend as Dr. Richard Feynman.The man, who has always intrigued me, not only had a deep love and appreciation of the universe he dedicated his live to understanding but of life itself. Famous just as much for his goofy personality and biting sense of humor as he is for his Nobel Prize-winning work in subfields of theoretical physics such as Quantum Electrodynamics and superfluidity, Richard Feynman is portrayed in this book in a much more touching way.Not the strange bongo-playing Caltech physics professor, or lock picking Manhattan Project character he was in his youth, Feynman is instead portrayed as a reflective, dying man with no regrets and the same immense curiosity that had driven him his whole life.Much of the book is taken verbatim from tape recorded conversations the author had with Feynman while he was a research fellow at Caltech. One detects the same sense of humor he or she may find in many of his lectures from decades before, but in addition sees a much more serious side of Dr. Feynman, who has accepted death as his final experiment which he hopes to find &quot;IN-ter-ES-ting.&quot; The tone of the entire memoir is very sad and reflective, but reveals tremendous insights regarding life, happiness, the universe, persistence, and wonder. These insights come not from Dr. Feynman's tremendous knowledge or intelligence, but from his equally impressive wisdom.Now, parts of the book did seem a bit presumptuous of the author in that he only knew Feynman for a couple years, and not terribly well. When I first began the book (I read it in one sitting...not that it's terribly short) I was a bit disturbed by this fact, but I soon realized that this allowed for a point of view often uncommon to biographical works. His objectivity in observing Feynman is not tainted by years of knowing the man, but only by the immense respect and love the author has for the man who first introduced him to physics when he borrowed The Feynman Lectures on physics from a library while in Israel.The author gives the feeling that he is experiencing Feynman not as one who has known him for years, not even one who has spent months researching him for a biography, but instead as one of us, the &quot;normal people,&quot; would experience the man. We don't just see just the brilliant scientist, but a few short glimpses at the man himself that reveal more about the heart of passionate scientists than any impersonal account could.This book is not a biography. Nor is it just about the Nobel laureate Dr. Richard Feynman. It is much more about what it is like to dedicate your life to science, and where every person's sense of wonder and awe should fit into his or her life. The book repeatedly mentions Feynman's disdain for philosophy and psychology, which is I believe intentionally ironic as both are more the focus of the book than Feynman diagrams, path integrals, or quantum energy states. The books speaks of discover not in the context of specific examples, but in the form of general abstraction and contemplation that gives the reader a greater appreciation for discovery as a human quality that we all possess. Because, as Feynman said, hell, if an ape can make a discovery, we all certainly can."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"&quot;Some time with Feynman&quot; is the European title of this book. It may be less poetic that the US title, but gives a better idea of its content and what inspired his author.Even as a non scientist, and like many, I wish I had met professor Feynman or attended one of his lectures. Leonard Mlodinow had this privilege. Through the transcripts of his personal tape recordings, he relives with us the readers the times when he could go down the hall and speak to his brilliant yet so human colleague.Sharing the positive nostalgia of someone remembering a friend, no matter how notorius, isn't that a bit meeting that friend ?A very enjoyable little book !"},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"The reviewer also recommends:Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character).In the winter of 1981, Mlodinow became a post-doctoral fellow at Caltech, where two Nobel Prize winners, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann, had offices down the hall. The author wanted someone to help him emerge from his creative drought, and figured that it would be his idol Feynman. One day he knocked on the door to Feynman's office, and was welcome ... This is the story of the author's young days as well as Feynman, Gell-Mann and the world of the physical theory named string theory in its beginning.In an early chapter we learn that Feynman used to say there were two kinds of physicists, the Babylonians and the Greeks. The former focused on the phenomena, and the latter, on the underlying order. Gell-Mann was a Greek, and Feynman considered himself a Babylonian. Echoing this, the author understandably writes in a later chapter, \\"Feynman scorned string theory, Murray championed it. That was Feynman and Murray - attracted by each other's genius, repelled by each other's philosophy.\\"I have found the following gems of Feynman's words told to the author: \\"An important part of the creative process is play.\\" \\"The scientist's imagination always is different from a writer's in that it is checked.\\" \\"She (Arlene, Feynman's wife in his first marriage) taught me that one has to be irrational sometimes.\\" You might find some more you like in this book.In the last chapter the author thinks of Feynman in this way, \\"If there is one thing he taught me, it is the importance of being truly committed to whatever it is we are striving for.\\" This small and readable book would a good addition to the bookshelf of the fans of the People's Physicist Feynman. It is to be noted that \\"Some Time with Feynman\\" is not a different book by the same author but the European title of this book."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I thought that the book was very interesting, and being an aspiring physicist myself, it was helpful for me to learn the culture of the physics world (or at least what it used to be). It also provided very interesting character information for not only Feynman but Murray Gel-Mann.However, I would not suggest this book for anyone looking for a more formal or factual biography of Feynman, or a more physics-oriented text. I feel that the primary purpose of this text was autobiographical. Much of the book consisted of Dr Mlodinow discussing his experiences as a young insecure physicist. I did enjoy reading the book, and learned a lot about Feynman I might not have known otherwise. Also included in the chapters are conversations record from Feynman, which were also very intriguing.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about Feynman's personality and discover some of the challenges of physics on a more psychological level. I have this book four stars because, though I enjoyed learning about Feynman and found the book an interesting read, I couldn't personally connect with the authors troubles. But I feel it is a good resource for me and should be considered by anyone who wonders about the life of a physicist."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"A short but passionate, humanizing read; not so much a biography as a story about the fateful interaction between a young, adrift soul and the wisened spirit of Richard Feynman."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I'm not a physicist but have been a long-time fan of Feynman's writings for lay people.And I've become a fan of Mlodinow over the last couple of years, starting with \\"Drunkard's Walk\\" then this book and now \\"Subliminal.\\"So, for me it was a treat to discover (and read) \\"Feynman's Rainbow\\" and enjoy Mlodinow's take on and humanizing of Feynman in this book by way of recreating their relationship in these pages for all of us to see.I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"This is a worthy effort by a \\"former\\" physicist. Mlodinow is a postdoc at Caltech in the early 80s who is struggling with the age old question \\"what should I do with my life\\"?Sandwiched within his time at Caltech, Mlodinow is heavily influenced by Feynman who is slowly dying of cancer. Feynman's approach to physics (and life as a whole) is explored in a unique fashion in this highly readable memoir."},{"Title":"Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life","review":"I liked this book. It is obviously not about Feynman. It does provide an insight into scientific discovery and a different perspective on Feynman. There's a touch of the raw reality of life."},{"Title":"Byzantine Empresses: Women and Power in Byzantium AD 527-1204","review":"In the monarchies of Western Europe, until very recent times, female rulers were rare. Not unknown, but very uncommon. In the eastern system of rulership, however, women not infrequently were able to take power, either holding great authority as regents for underage sons or ruling autocratically as empresses in their own name. Garland has put together a collection of biographical portraits of thirteen of these women and uses her observations to look for common methods and themes in their reigns. What did these empresses intend to do? What did they actually accomplish? What do the historical sources (especially as produced by their contemporaries) have to say about what they did? She notes that a similar study was carried out by Charles Diehl in Figures Byzantines, but that two-volume work was published a century ago and interpretative styles have changed greatly (several times, in fact).Byzantine women rulers seem to have been willing to do whatever it took to seize and hold power, even when they began as regents, which implies a fixed period of caretaker duties. Irene actually had her son. Constantine VI, blinded so she could remain in control. And while it was assumed that an unmarried empress would take a husband and turn her power over to him, several chose not to do so. And even if they did marry, it was not unknown for the empress -- notably Sophia, niece of Empress Theodora -- to dominate her spouse on the grounds that her claim to the throne was at least as good as his. Even if the emperor was supposedly in charge, long absences on military campaigns often gave his wife, if she had the character and the will, the opportunity to exercise authority on her own. An empress also could greatly influence the transfer of power following the death of the emperor, as when Pulcheria Augusta selected Marcian as successor to her late brother, Theodosius II, and crowned him before the assembled army. Religious disputes also were far more common in Constantinople than in the West, especially in amazingly hair-splitting ways that led to much blood being spilled -- monophysite vs. monothelete vs. aphthartodocete and so on, and especially iconophile against iconoclast. Throughout the chapters of this book, one notes how often it was the women rulers who came down on the side of orthodoxy, which meant veneration of icons, in reaction to male iconoclast predecessors.Garland's style is academic while still being very readable and she provides the necessary paraphernalia for further research, including an excellent glossary, numerous plates (none in color, unfortunately), and a very extended bibliography."},{"Title":"Croatia: Travels in Undiscovered Country","review":"Croatia: Travels In Undiscovered Country by Tony Fabijancic is a superbly written, personal memoir and eye-witness travelogue of what it was like to experience the land and people of Croatia as both an ancestral home and an undiscovered country. Transporting the reader on one man's journey into a rich and varied landscape, Croatia: Travels In Undiscovered Country is a vividly written, deftly informative, and memorably presented experience of a land steeped in centuries of tradition and lore. Croatia: Travels In Undiscovered Country is especially recommended reading for armchair travelogue adventure enthusiasts and anyone thinking of a trip to Croatia for themselves."},{"Title":"Croatia: Travels in Undiscovered Country","review":"A terrific book. I have found no other book on Croatia that offers such insight into the country's current way of life and historical emblems, without becoming trite or resorting solely to political fact listing. Reveals the fragile beauty of a an undiscovered country in the midst of economic and cultural change. A wonderful travel book. Accessible and imaginative writing. Very well done."},{"Title":"Croatia: Travels in Undiscovered Country","review":"I recently returned from three weeks in Croatia and came across this book. I would say Tony's writing is fair to good, and I enjoyed his insights into how the country felt and looked in 1996 post war. Because most of my time was spent along the Dalmatian Coastline his stories have inspired me to spend time on my upcoming return to Croatia in the rurual areas. Speaking Hrvatska is going to help and for anyone contemplating travel to Croatia he does a good job of articulating the lifestyle of 10 years ago. It is changing drmatically now that it is poised to join the EU. His stories are off the beaten tourist path and defininitely reflect the flavor of a very diverse country that remains in denial about its history and its future."},{"Title":"Croatia: Travels in Undiscovered Country","review":"This is an account of its author's travels in what for him was \\"undiscovered country\\" but for the reader, save for this book, would be forever undiscoverable. Mr. Fabiancic, a Canadian born in Croatia, fluent in the language and connected with the culture, combines a native's access with a foreigner's perspective; he thus engages deeply on our behalf with places and people that otherwise, if we encountered them at all, would be no more than two-dimensional snapshots, real or remembered.Indeed, much of what Mr. Fabiancic saw and experienced just ten or so years ago may well already have been swept away by the riptide of progress that has swept over the newly independent nation since the disintegration of the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991. His observations are keen and his descriptions immediate.Mr. Fabiancic also shares his inner travels with his audience. That aspect of the book is not especially to the taste of this reader, for whom Mr. Fabiancic's reports of personal epiphanies and developmental milestones (\\"My youth is over\\") get in the way of his descriptions of the often striking landscape and its often colorful and, it seems, always engaging inhabitants. At times, too, his striving for literary effect can be a bit labored: in places the similes are so thickly spread as to obscure the nouns they are meant to illuminate, and more than one perfectly effective account is blunted by a last-minute effort to give it Meaning.Should such distractions tempt you to put the book down, don't. If you find a chapter heavy going, try another; they vary in style, as in subject matter, and little is lost by reading them out of order. Later, returning to a passage that had seemed a little overblown, you may experience it more sympathetically. Especially if you have in mind to visit Croatia, the author's vivid insight into what the country and its people are and have been will make coping with the book's less successful qualities more than worth your while."},{"Title":"Croatia: Travels in Undiscovered Country","review":"I was hoping for a book about Croatia that is written by somebody who does have Croatian heritage and knows how to write. It is well written and author did try to be objective and to put some interesting historical facts aboot Croatia. However, at times it is too personal and talks a lot about author's own family. I would have preffered if the book was thicker and included many other families as well as many other places in Croatia, but I guess as a travel book it fulfills its purpose."},{"Title":"Doctor on the Brain","review":"I ordered the books as I have enjoyed all the Doctor in the House television series.

At the core of this book, however, lies the reason that I'm a Welborn fan. In succinct fashion, this book manages to educate, provoke and inspire the reader. Each of the daily offerings in the book includes a scripture reference, a two to five paragraph reflection, and a closing prayer. In her introductory remarks, Welborn shares that in this book she's tried to help the reader \\"clear a spiritual space\\" in her busy life to recognize the Presence of God.Like most of the women I know, Welborn is a busy professional, a wife and mother who seems to \\"do it all\\" with great success. Perhaps that is why she was able to write this book in a tone that hits home for so many of us. If you're looking to make quiet time and daily prayer a part of your spiritual life, you will find this book to be a wonderful companion. A great gift for women of any age or situation, or a give yourself a treat and add it to your spiritual library."},{"Title":"A Catholic Woman's Book of Days","review":"This book is well written, but it is not relevant to me...over 50, no children. The readings deal with family life joys and problems, most of which I have not experienced. Therefore, I cannot draw meaning from the devotions. Also, the devotions seem to be mostly the story of her life, not any good advice for me.

Her beliefs and her faith are rock-solid and she will defend them to the death. In \\"A Catholic Woman's Book of Day's,\\" I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to meet a softer side of Welborn.This book offers a reflection for each day of the year, beginning with a scripture verse, then Welborn's comments, and concluding with a short prayer. In her reflections, Welborn shares stories from her own life, her struggles with parenting and her career and her pain at not being able to be at her mother's side as she passed away. She conveys all the hopes and prayers that all of us who struggle to make our way in the world can relate to. She speaks of having difficulties with her spiritual life at times and finding the faith to keep going. She offers her prayers of thanksgiving and praise and contrition and petition. She invites us to walk a year's journey with her.These short reflections are perfect for a quick jolt of spirituality in the morning, or anytime in the day when you have five minutes to spare. Welborn has outdone herself with \\"A Catholic Woman's Book of Days.\\""},{"Title":"A Catholic Woman's Book of Days","review":"To be clear up front, this review is for the Kindle edition of the book. I bought this for my wife as she was looking for a good daily devotional for Catholic moms. This seems to fill the bill nicely.

Even worse, the date titles (e.g. July 2) are all images within the book so they cannot be searched. It took about five minutes to find the current date by trial and error and specifying locations within the Kindle.

However. There are several items that distinguish this biography; the stories by Sonja\`s secretary Dorothy Stevens in particular... It is true that in creating the ice-skating star Sonja Henie, her father created a monster. But in the long run Sonja suffered from it. She was never taught to be a normal person. And indeed: She gave Norway a place in the sun and donated with her third husband Niels Onstad the Henie-Onstad ArtGallery near Oslo. U should visit it if u came to Norway. All of Sonja\`s medals and trophies are in a well-guarded room and photos etc from her films are displayed in a huge basement. It must never be forgotten that she gave our nation a great deal - indeed giving the community of Brum a home for retired people.

The exercises it are very loosely based in the Pilates method. Being a Pilates instructor, I am always seeing what is on the market in order to make recommendations to students in my classes on materials to use at home.A Pilates book aimed at men is long over due . . . I was completely disappointed when I sat down and started reading this through. For the reviewer who was not seeing results he wanted in the Pilates method (six pac abs, big muscles, etc.), you have been miseducated on what to expect from doing it. So please, don't \\"dis\\" the Pilates method because you didn't see visible results. And, you were probably doing it wrong.This exercise routine may work for some, but if you are new to Pilates, this is a far cry from the real thing. I would suggest doing a search on Amazon's search engine and getting the other Pilates for Men book that appears. It is far better."},{"Title":"Pilates for Men: The Total Solution for Strength, Flexibility and Power","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift from my daughter. I was skeptical at first that Pilates could help out a weekend softball player like myself. As a new years resolution I work out 3 times per week at home. Through the first 3 weeks of the year I have lost 10lbs via working out with IM=X and a new diet.

Traditional Pilates was created for dancers as a rehabilitation program (which is not the general male population).I read this book thoroughly, and McNergney has created a strong pilates based program called IM=X. After trying the exercise routines I find this program to be very powerful and has helped me improve my \\"core strength\\" (lower back trunk muscles and abs). If I tried the traditional pilates moves I would probably end up on the couch with a strained back because of the dancer moves.By supplementing the IM=X Program with some cardio (biking) I am in the best shape I have been in a long time. I also no longer have lower back pain. Being in shape is not about how big your muscles are (anyone can take steroids illegally to get big).

But I had surgery on my right foot in early January of this year, and was on crutches and a walker, or in a wheelchair, as well as wearing a medical boot, for three months. I'd been doing mostly cardio before the surgery, and not strength training - so I was not prepared for how exhausting all of that would be. Using those things requires all your body strength. I need to have surgery on my left foot next fall, too. So I decided to get in shape for the next go-round. I've already started a strength training program, which is great. But I thought I'd try Pilates once more, since I'd heard it strenthens your core - which is super-important when using crutches. I checked this book out of my local library last night, and so far I'm already pretty impressed. I especially love the ab exercises that use weights. My current strength trainig program does that, too, and I think this is a very innovative approach. (I'm using \\"The Home Workout Bible\\" for my strength training. I'm a woman, but I think men's workouts are terrific, so I use them.) I'm planning to buy this book, and incorporate the exercises into my workouts. Somebody designing a Pilates program I LIKE? Thank you!UPDATE, March 25, 2011: I did indeed buy the book, and the workouts are kickin' it! I can really feel it in my abs. I'd definitely recommend this if you need a good ab workout book.

There are over 150 pictures in its 144 pages all of them clear as bells and none of them seen before by me.In addition to the pictures, there is text on each page and the text is what sets it apart from other books of its type. The book is written by Mike Monte, who I know. He lives in Crandon, Wisconsin, is a former logger and the son and grandson of old time lumberjacks. Where he got all the original photos I don't know but, the writing comes naturally to him from a life long interest in the logging history of the north woods. If its possible to love the sinner while hating the sin, Mike does that. He makes plain his contempt for the timber barons who were responsible for the cutting and running but his love and respect for those people who actually did the work and lived the life shows through on every page.Although most of the book is about the loggers, teamsters, railroaders, sawmillers and river rats who did the work, there is also a lot about their wives and families. There is an entire chapter on \\"Padus\\" a typical \\"sawdust\\" town which no longer exists. Its now part of the small town of Wabeno. There are pictures of boiler explosions, train wrecks and fires all of which plagued these early towns and mills. Pictures of stores and saloons and mud choked main streets. People in their Sunday best and lumberjacks sleeping 4 and 5 to a bed in the logging camps. All with colorful descriptions , some from elderly people who actually lived the history.You learn a lot about those days. Beneath a shot of a 'Jack with a two bitted axe, for example, Mike explains that they kept one edge sharp, the other dull and used the dull end on frozen wood since a sharp edge would chip out on frozen wood.Since the timber companies all paid about the same wages, food in the camps made all the difference. Mike says that 'jacks would quit jobs to follow good cooks from one job to the next.The book doesn't stop with the clearing of the pines. There are sections on the follow up harvests of hemlock and hardwoods and, finally, the cutting of what was left for pulpwood. By the 1920s it was pretty much all over. Some 70 years to take it all.For those who are really interested, Mike shows pictures and explains, for example, the difference between an A frame jammer and a slide ass jammer, both of which were used to load logs onto railway cars. The book can serve as a history lesson into a colorful industry of the past and/or, simply a collection of interesting photos. Either way, its well worth owningDave Johnson"},{"Title":"Cut and Run: Loggin' Off the Big Woods","review":"The publisher stumbled onto a treasure in this collection of photographs of early logging in America. Mike Monte's enthusiasm shines through his commentary on the history of logging. He's interested in the loggers, their trees, their lifestyle, their machinery, their locales, their women, in short, in everything associated with the logging industry in the United States more than a century ago. I keep wondering what it would be like to eat in the logging tent at the table with these rough-looking guys, or sleep on a plywood cot next to a fellow still wearing his hobnail boots--or hang out the laundry in a couple feet of snow....this book is to die for!"},{"Title":"Cut and Run: Loggin' Off the Big Woods","review":"this is the best book I have ever seen/ read about logging history in the Midwest.

It is not bad, but I think that there is too little concept art. I mean, in the race concept art, you find a lot of 3D images of the game and that's not concept, that's result, and I think they could have put more sketches or illustrations. The whole layup is a bit messy.I bought this book beacause I am a big fan of wacraft and world of warcraft, and I expected as concept art book, something like the Starcraft 2 artbook.

It focuses light upon what has been dark too long. It also brings General Semantics into the mainstream in a useful, logical manner vs. some of the more technical GS literature which seems questionable from a scientific perspective. True, the author is a strong proponent of psychic phenomena. But, a true scientist keeps an open mind and the literature is growing and convincing in these areas. For example, the illustrious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) did a rigorous study on telepathy and published the sender's randomly selected photographs right next to the receiver's hand drawn responses. The results were VERY convincing. But, ESP is NOT the main thrust of this book. Rather, it is an attempt to integrate and extend intuitive reasoning minds through the past and into the near future.

If that sounds boring, dont be dissapointed - there is plenty in this book that will get your blood boiling, expecially if you are new to religious history.Gina goes into detail about how Religion is intertwined into culture, nation building and almost every facet of life, and yet it tries to stay uninfluenced by these things but forgets that all these things move on given enough time, and religion has to move with it.Her rational approach to the subject is refreshing, it completely rejects the traditions that keep religion unable to move or update itself. That was done on purpose, as She tries to dispense with a lot of primitive nonsense and distill out what a real religion would look like that has cut all ties with its past.

The approach is not &quot;blaming&quot; the targeted individuals -- it's empowering them. Elgin has never suggested, either in print or aloud, that verbal abuse victims are responsible for the hostile language environments that make their lives miserable, but she has told them how to take control and cure their environments. This book teaches that at a level written to those who need it most."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"This book was awesome . I read it in a few days. It is well written and very practical. It has helped me immensely in stopping big arguements with my family. But I review and practice the principles. If someone says it does not work, they are not willing to make the effort to learn and practice the principles. Some people prefer to just say it is impossible and like books that attack their abuser so they can have a pity party for themselves."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I ordered this book because it interested me when it was listed in the \\"people who order this book also recommend. . .\\" category when I bought another book on verbal abuse \\"Your Perfect Right\\". I read and use books often as a means of learning new information and skills and found \\"You Can't Say That to Me\\" to provide good information and an accessible means of using this information instantly in situations involving verbal abuse. Other reviewers have criticized the author's view of verbal abusers as just another means of communicating (rather than as \\"the bad guys\\") and have disliked the obvious stories used to illustrate her information points. I can see where such criticisms arise, but the author is very clear about categorizing abusers using \\"styles of speech\\" from a linguistic perspective and including the category of people who are verbally abusive because they are \\"psychologically disturbed\\". This helped me identify times when I think I'm am being slammed, but it is more a matter of communication styles and the interactions of our different styles, and times when I am dealing with someone who habitually uses verbal abuse as a means of domination, or building up themselves by putting down others. I think this book is extremely useful for people who are not tortured by chronic verbal abuse situations and an inability to defend themselves, but have times when they feel put down harshly but are not certain of the intent, nor how to respond without being self-defensive or abusive themselves. Her approach using knowledge of linguistics was not at all academically dense (as is \\"Your Perfect Right\\") and I found myself able to use the methods of analysis and response in real life as I was reading the book. Yes, many of her story examples are fairly simplistic, but this is not to over-simplify real life events, but to provide clarity about the information she is providing. It really is comforting to be able to think to myself \\"Yes, this person has their own problem and enjoys/benefits from abusing, demeaning, me - or - well, I can see how it came about that I felt put-down in the communication with this person because we were using conflicted styles of expression that fed on each other.\\"Also, when I read the list of other books by this author, I found that she also has written one of my favorite scifi/fantasy genre novel series \\"Native Tongue\\". This gave me a greater understanding of the author and how she views people and their linguistic styles. Although, the information in this book is easily understood and used by someone who doesn't really understand what linguistics is all about.I would have put a fifth star on my review if the book also had provided more information on dealing with people who use language to purposefully demean and diminish me as a means of raising their own value. But, this is a big subject with many different aspects than the type of verbal abuse dealt with in this particular book. So, I will check out other books by Elgin to see if one is more focused on how to deal with abuse from people who really are trying to hurt me, and succeeding."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"Elgin's book brought tears to my eyes as I recognized myself in the examples provided in her book. What I liked best about this book is that I began to see that my relationship with my former husband was not my only instance of horrific verbal abuse. It forced me to admit to myself that all of my intimate relationships with men have been verbally abusive; and I came to recognize that verbal violence was a part of my regular communication with my siblings and my mother. What could this mean? I began to see that I was in fact the common denominator. This is not to say that I deserve verbal abuse or that it is my fault. The only coping skills I knew were to fall into my verbal abusers traps by pleading and debating. Not to mention the emotional aftermath of feeling like a worthless human being. Elgin provided me with an excellent selection of new verbal strategies. While it would be great if these verbal skills have an effect on the abusers in my life the real victory is that I will now have more control over how I react to the verbal abuse. I will now no longer be reduced to a mewling child begging for forgiveness for the rainy weather that somehow was my fault. What I struggled with was Elgin's implication that these systems are infallible. I think that presentation is dangerously flawed. Part of my abuse cycle is that my abusers had me convinced that my love was the most important thing in their world. I would therefore forgive them, believe them and accept their abuse because I felt responsible for loving them. \\"He loves me,\\" I would think, \\"underneath it all he is a good person and he needs me.\\" Therefore I endured these relationships and repeated my abuse cycle. Elgin unfortunately gave strength to that misconception. As I stated, I cried from this book because my first thoughts were ones of guilt: \\"If only I had this book sooner; I could have saved my marriage!\\" But I do know that even Elgin could not have helped me there. The truth is you cannot change another person with your own actions. You only have control of your own self. An abuser must ultimately accept responsibility for the pain that they cause. I do understand that the abuser inflicts pain to mask their own, but I know very few abusers who are willing to face their demons and change. I am excited to try her techniques in my life and begin empowering myself. However, abuse of any kind I will not tolerate anymore. In my situation, divorce was my only option. Sometimes the only way to end the abuse is to say goodbye. I wish Elgin had addressed that issue."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I picked up this book one day hoping to find hope that I wasn't the crazy one in my past abusive relationship. Through constant self-afflicting blame for my abuse I thought Elgin's work would shed some light upon my despair. Although the title in itself was profound and sold me to begin with I found it to be very disappointing. I felt even more worse than before closing yet another book aimed toward my self-blame I just couldn't handle anylonger. I haven't picked it up since and have actually disregarded Elgin's great accomplishment since her last work.Apparently she has never been in an abusive situation with a man or woman with whom there are no ways to manipulate any possible scenario headed towards verbal abuse. No matter how excellent or advanced one's communication skills are developed, there is no logical way around the abuser's chosen victim. Yes, as humans we all hold the potential to become abusive in our ways, but there is certainly a difference between a person who is rational and one who simply is not. Amongst abusers the more you try to rationalize with them the closer you are to escalating the abuse at hand. So, the true matter at hand in abusive situations is control. But isn't that what these tactics are, in which Elgin proposses? To actually take control of a scenario before it reaches abuse? I feel it only teaches victims how to manipulate, control and learn to turn the tables in adopting abusive actions themselves. We need peace of mind for our children and our emotional wellbeing, not more violence........."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I didn't find any of Elgin's suggestions helpful. As a victim of verbal abuse, I can't believe she expects people to respond to abuse in such a way, and her idea that a few well-chosen words will stop an abuser is ludicrous. She also leaves out one important thing: even if this were to work, her methods don't include confronting your abuser or making him/her own up to being an abuser. Not exactly empowering! I found this book to be a complete waste of my money."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"The author makes some very good points about it taking two people to participate in a negative verbal exchange. She wants the victim of verbal abuse to not feel completely helpless, that said, she doesn't claim that this will fix an abusive relationship but focuses on the linguistics of the exchange. The techniques she shares to neutralize the conversation as opposed to \\"feeding the abusive verbal loop\\" are very helpful. I wish there were less repetition of certain philosophies and more and varied examples of each technique. I felt the organization of the concepts was a bit scattered... i.e. a \\"note\\" about the effect on children caught as observers at the end of a completely unrelated chapter when in an earlier chapter she seemed to suggest that she would touch on this topic in greater detail later. It may just be my learning style, but I found this book harder to read because of the way the topics and unrelated subtopics were arranged. I found myself skipping around a lot in the book to make sense of it. Overall some great ideas to try. By the way, not one of the techniques involves stating plainly to the abuser that, \\"you can't say that to me!\\""},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"This book has some good examples of how to communicate better with others, and strategies for defusing potential conflict before it escalates.Miler's Law is a good reminder to actually lisen to what is being said, rather than adding your own perceptions to the speaker's words. The three-part message is a well-known and effective tool for communicating a request and the book provides a variation on that.The techniques in this book would be helpful with someone who is 'normal' and having trouble communicating and expressing themselves, however this won't work with people that are abusive because abuse is not about communication, it instead is about power and control over another and someone trying to get their way.Sadly, in the couple Suzette uses as her example, they don't have a communication issue, the husband is a bully and is constantly berating his wife and I think it is important to differentiate this. No quick retort or defusing response is going to stop him bullying her or take responsibility for his actions and change his behaviour."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I have to admit, I haven't even finished the book yet. That's because it became clear to me right away that Elgin isn't writing about \\"verbal abuse\\", she's writing about how to deal with rude comments from other people. That's kind of like offering an aerobic kick-boxing class to a woman whose husband beats her and telling her that should solve her marital problems.True abusers will not respond to Elgin's techniques the way she suggests they will. That should be your first clue that you're in an abusive relationship - this stuff doesn't work. Yes, Elgin's suggestions will have some positive effects (and is worth reading for those), but the abuse will not stop. In fact, it could even get worse as you begin to feel more empowered and the abuser senses he is losing control over you.If you suspect you are in a verbally abusive relationship, GET HELP. See a therapist and read Evans' \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship\\" or something else about REAL verbal abuse. You can find your way out, it's just not in this book.Good luck."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"There are some abusive people in this world who are simply self-absorbed.

Please forgive the drama, but without this book, I sincerely believe my marriage would be over now. This book, and Genderspeak, also by Elgin, provide everyone with the tools to take control of an always obnoxious and sometimes dangerous situation that exists in many relationships, verbal abuse. Elgin gives power to both parties involved. The abused learns to handle the angry words coming at them in a calm, effective manner. The abuser learns to look at his/her behavior from his partner's point of view.One of your reviews calls this &quot;blaming the victim.&quot; I disagree!! Elgin provides tools to deal with verbal abuse, in contrast to others (Evans included) who conclude by advising that the relationship terminate, since there is generally no good way to handle the situation. Elgin's approach is empowering to both parties, her message is &quot;You are NOT helpless and you do NOT have to run away from this!&quot;"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"What a waste! I agree with the other reviewers. This book might be of some (limited) benefit in dealing with verbal jabs from people with whom you have limited contact or limited emotional investment. But, her assertion that these techniques will defuse all but the most egregious verbal abusers is so absurd that it makes me wonder if she's ever been in the same room with one. Don't waste your time or money. A MUCH BETTER option would be Patricia Evans' &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship.&quot; Evans addresses the problem, from why it happens to how to recognize it to what you can and can not do about it. Elgin tries to create a Pollyanna world where the abuser will respond logically and like a &quot;sane&quot; human being. If that were the case, you wouldn't be considering this book in the first place."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I found Elgin's techniques to be extremely helpful when I was struggling with remaining in an abusive situation. They helped me recognize, analyze, and divert the verbal abuse. Although it did not cure the abuser of the need to abuse, it did change the abuse to more open and easily recognized forms, that made the final solution more obvious. These techniques have been extremely useful in other instances of verbal abuse from healthy individuals, and have changed the mode of communication of those individuals towards me for the better.

He just expects her to be obedient like some dog.Elgin says if you just respond the right way you can stop the verbal abuse. This just isn't true. Most verbal abusers are just looking to find fault about anything.The problem lies with the abuser and not the victim. The abuser needs to learn how to stop treating people that way.Most victims of abuse spend years twisting and contorting themselves to try to fix what they are doing wrong so the abuse will stop.Notice the in the scenarios the abuse never stopped. Just until next time when the husband felt like blowing up about something again."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. I am desperate to find some effective strategies for dealing with a verbally and emotionally abusive parent. The author makes one good point: that what abusers want is to get attention and a \\"rise\\" out of you. But her strategies for avoiding this are *only* useful for very *mild* cases. I laughed out loud at some of the techniques she thinks would work. She clearly does not know my abuser. She herself does note this, by saying that some people have an underlying problem that has to be solved before the abuse will stop. But what to do in that case? Her only answer is that you may have to leave, and of course one can't \\"leave\\" a parent. She completely ignores that the verbal abuser is usually blackmailing you in a very effective way until you give in to them. Ultimately, the book is misnamed. This is not about verbal *abuse,* but simply about becoming more effective communicators with normal people."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"In this book, Dr. Elgin gives practical ways to handle verbal attacks and discourage future abuse. In today's world, those suffering verbal abuse are often accused of being to blame for their situation. This leaves them feeling even more helpless and guilty. In reality such situations often arise for reasons having little to do with the 'guilt' of the person receiving the abuse. Recognizing this, the author teaches some of the specific forms verbal abuse takes and the most effective response to that form. By teaching effective ways to handle specific language interactions, Dr. Elgin gives receivers of abuse the power to break the cycle without futher endangering themselves. Though appearing simple on the surface, these techniques have been proven to work in real relationships. I have found this book and others in the Gentle Art of Verbal Self Defense series to be of much help in both my own relationships and the relationships of those with whom I shared the information."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"This book could have provided the useful material in about one-fourth of the length, which is why I rated it down. What I got out of it that is helpful to me includes the following. Never feed the verbal violence loop - use neutral intonation and impersonal language (the 2 main keys to her theory). Also that we need to realize that, \\"Letting verbal abusers' insults and smart cracks and hurtful remarks go by isn't letting them get away with it. Allowing them to succeed in their goal of tying up your attention and getting an emotional reaction from you is letting them get away with it.\\" I also found helpful some specific \\"language stategies\\" to use for getting up and leaving when the conversation is hostile and apparently going nowhere."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"Found this book to be full of constructive, tangible ways to change the way I communicate.

The first section on &quot;Miller's Law&quot; is a blueprint for continuing the dynamic of verbal abuse, because it asks the partner to try to understand what she must have done to deserve the abuse. There is never an excuse for abuse, and it isn't the recipients fault, no matter what."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"The author's recommendation for responding to verbal abuse from a spouse or significant other amounts to &quot;cleverly change the subject, and all will be well&quot;. That might work with small children, but it doesn't work with abusive spouses. The author's prescription reflects a breathtaking lack of appreciation for what the victims of verbal abuse are subjected to, day in and day out, often for many hours at a time and with no meaningful way to escape, and is quite reminiscent of 'just say no' as a cure for drug addiction. I think that a good deal of the problem comes from the lack of a clear distinction between abuse and occasional crankiness. The author's word games may offer a polite way of deflecting the latter, but as to the former they are a surefire prescription for continuing to be abused. I don't know what the solution is, but you won't find it in this book."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"Many are raised with one parent, or both, who is verbally abusive.

This one has more new information in it than the others."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"What is a misandrist? One who \\"hates the male sex,\\" as Patricia Evans and a good portion of her followers irrefutably convey the impression of doing! You could do yourself a tremendous favor by ignoring the reviews about how superior Evans' book is to Elgin's book - as Evans' book is primarily catered to those who have a loathing for the male species, and/or a relentless compulsion to blame any and all of their problems on the \\"big, bad men\\" of the world.Quite the opposite of what some reviewers would lead you to believe: \\"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse\\" offers much more effective responses to putting an end to verbal abuse than the notoriously simplistic \\"STOP IT!\\" and \\"CUT THAT OUT!\\" replies Evans advocates. Which, ironically enough, in many instances only serve to inflame the abuse. How many times have you been witness to grade school bullies ceasing their behavior by the target merely yelling, \\"DON'T DO THAT!\\" and \\"YOU'RE AN ABUSER!\\"Instead, Elgin teaches you how to PRODUCTIVELY communicate with someone who is verbally abusing you, as the more enhanced your communication skills the less your potential of being abused. In fact, by utilizing her wonderful techniques you will find you can greatly diminish or even eradicate the abuse from anyone in your life - family, friends, coworkers, et al - not just the domestic partner.Additionally, Elgin's work (unlike that of Evans) also refrains from depicting all abusers as malevolent \\"dragons\\" who cannot be reasoned with no matter what, because not ALL abusers are alike! And, in enough unions, there are TWO human beings behaving abusively toward each other, so immediately labeling one party the hopeless abuser can do a disservice to both.Otherwise, yes, there are some individuals where no matter what you say or do they will continue to be abusive (i.e., chronic abusers who need therapy but either refuse to get it or refuse to stick with it, those who have mental illness and behavioral disorders, and so on), but in such a scenario all Evans' book will do is encourage you to be angry, hateful, and blaming toward that person - not truly empowered and liberated like Elgin does!"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"If you've ever been the victim of verbal abuse, you'll find this book very helpful.

The scenarios she uses are silly. In short, this book is about the cause and effect of verbal communication. The wife is angry and verbally abusive, so the husband 'catches' that and passes it on to his coworkers...and so forth. She is trying to basically dissect how a person says something will affect people in different ways depending on HOW they say it. Isn't that obvious?

This is more of a self-help manual for normal relationships. Verbal Abuse is different -- you cannot stop the abuse, nothing will work. Abusers lack empathy.

But I couldn't take the author seriously after the first scenario where the husband tears into the wife over a dinner casserole. If my [lovely] husband *ever* treated me that way or some man treated my daughter like this, my reponse would *not* be to be calm, rational, and understanding, but to kick the jerk out. Immediately.

I read the reviews for Patricia Evans' books and right or wrong it seemed there was at times a lot of anger projected, however understandably. Apparently her books helped some folks very much and that is good. But my favorite Source of advice says: \\"Do not exchange insult for insult or [what it seems to me was in some of the reviews] rancor for rancor.\\" \\"Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.\\" \\"Treat all persons [this means even abusers - though one can respectfully leave them if necessary!] with respect.\\" This means we know we are entitled to be treated with respect too! \\"A gentle answer turns away wrath.\\" \\"In all things, love.\\" If it's not obvious, those quotes are from Scriptures. My humble opinion, if the advice in Elgin's book, and prayer, don't work for a particular person, then okay leave him or her before they hurt you more. This would be even more essential if children are involved, because they should not witness, and possibly learn, or experience the abusive treatment themselves. However, if the lost cause abusers are in your family or work place and you can't get away, distance yourself from them emotionally and physically as much as possible. \\"Do not make friends with an angry person lest you become ensnared in his ways.\\" \\"Anger resides in the lap of fools.\\" \\"He who controls his temper is mightier than one who conquers a city.\\""},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"If you want to read a book about verbal abuse that is empowering and teaches linguistic techniques and behaviors to blunt and reduce verbal abuse aimed at you, read this book, and any of the other Elgin books.If you want a book that absolves you of any responsibility, and more importantly, strips any feelings of power you have, then read the books by Patricia Evans.

Things that have helped me in my everyday life."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I just wanted to echo the words of the reader from Minneapolis who pointed out that the concept promoted here, that anyone can be successful with this method, is wrong, is dead right! In other words, great book, and well worth trying very hard at. But - be aware as you read this that there are people with something called Narcissistic Personality Disorder who cannot change because they are unable to experience empathy. And empathy is fundamental to &quot;real&quot; human relationships, fundamental to having someone understand how something feels to you. I suffered for too many years trying to make this approach work. It did me a lot of good, I admit, but it didn't change my abuser's behavior. He stopped doing certain things and started doing others. And I felt so terribly guilty about that, when in fact he really was whacked out and incapable of change. Thank goodness I finally found a therapist who specializes in abuse to help me figure this out. So please - read this book and try it. It can do you a world of good. But also be aware of the limitations of being able to change someone else. The only real goal should be changing yourself, which is great. And if they don't change then, it's time to leave, because nobody but nobody can or should put up with continuing abuse."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"Elgin states in the beginning of this book that this is the work that her whole &quot;Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense&quot; series has been building up to. I would agree, in that this is a solid guide for those suffering from verbal abuse.There's nothing in this book that will make you jump up and shout &quot;Eureka! That's the solution!&quot; But the truth is that there probably is no such solution.What you WILL get from the book is a practical framework that you can build on to improve the situation. And, almost as important, to help you avoid the trial-and-error of trying out ways that don't really help in the long run.I might have given this book 4 stars, but one other thing makes me push it up to 5: the attitude the book encourages toward the verbal abuser. Other books for victims of verbal abuse engender a lot of negative feelings, sometimes to the point of hate-mongering. This book, however, helps you manage the situation without encouraging ill-will."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"From reading the reviews, some of the reviewers haven't read the book, it is obvious. Many of the complaints actually agree with the perspective of the book.For example someone complains that the book is about &quot;mastery of slick responses to throw the attacker off guard.&quot; That is not what the book is about. None of the responses are slick, none of the responses have to do with throwing anyone off guard. None of them are about fighting, instead they are all about relationships.Or the complaint that Elgin simplifies it all to &quot;the pain is all in your head&quot; -- Elgin is one of the few people who really believes that verbal abuse can kill you and it is terrible to have to endure. She never simplifies it to &quot;it is all in your head, you can just learn to ignore it&quot; -- in fact she teaches the exact opposit.I think that many of the reviewers are just reacting against books in this genre -- the same reason that Elgin wrote the one great book of its kind for normal people trying to deal with these problems while in the midst of them (her other books deal with related issues, but this one book is for the non-professional in real life home situations).What she does is go over how you can deal with abuse from people who are not mentally ill and with whom you deal in day to day and family relationships -- all recognizing that verbal abuse is a feedback loop, something many people do not know. The books teach how you can dampen the feedback loop instead of intensifing it, and by dampening it, control and remove it from relationships.My mother found this book invaluable for dealing with some people who had her at her wits end.Consider that when there is abuse in a situation not controlled by mental illness you can do one of two things: you can intensify the situation or you can defuse it. Elgin, in an eight step program of solid steps and approaches, goes over how to train yourself to recognize and defuse verbal violence without blaming yourself and without minimizing the harm that verbal abuse causes people.The techniques work. Over forty years of implementation and practice demonstrate that they work. In my practice I've given about fifty or more copies of her books for that very reason. The thing that marks this book from all of her others is that it is a program for teaching normal human beings how to use the techniques and how to escape the prison of abusive verbal loops that can destroy otherwise valuable relationships.If there is hope, then this is the book."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"When you read this book carefully, you learn that what this book is really about is how to understand why your communication may be going very wrong - despite your best intentions.If you are being hurt by what you feel are words spoken thoughtlessly, this book is for you. If you want to walk out the door of your home in the morning knowing you have more energy to face the world because you did not have to waste your strength is a fruitless family squabble, this book is for you. If you've always wanted to express yourself and your ideas more clearly and have them be received in the way you intend them, this book is definitely for you.Because what is book is really about is learning precise, yet loving-kind language. This book is about communicating very well without hurting anybody.On page 13, the author of this book, Dr. Suzette Haden Elgin, Ph.D. in Linguistics, shares a remarkable insight. She writes: &quot;Chronic communication breakdown happens when we don't realize the source of a problem is language and we take it for granted that the problem is caused by a _person_.&quot;If language precedes violence (and research shows that it does), it makes such good sense to be able to learn and speak the language and never have to worry about the violence. As a parent, journalist, and teacher for over 30 years, I needed this book. It helped me immensely at home and in my work.

This is a must have book for any relationship!"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"Elgin's Gentle Art system of Verbal Self-Defense empowers people so they no longer are easy targets of verbal abusers. The verbal abuse is met with systematic resposes based on how language works. This deflects and deescalates the verbal abuse. The abusive person is held accountable when the responses needed to keep the victim role going are not forthcoming. This puts them on notice immediately that things have changed. Verbally abusive people are insecure people who have learned to get temporary relief from their insecure thinking by verbally abusing others. Elgin's system disarms the presupposed claims of the abusive person including &quot;You are a victim, and I will get you to take the bait.&quot;Elgin's Eight Step program is effective. One of the things that naturally occurs as a person understands Elgin's system is that they become calmer, more grounded, and more confident. You use Elgin's system calmly without getting angry at the verbal abuser. You feel better about yourself because you are using your own inner resources (your language) to protect yourself and others."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"While Elgin provides some useful synopses, there are troublesome problems with her approach. The book is useful in identifying characteristics of verbal abuse, and for that it is well worth reading. Verbal and emotional abuse are very difficult to see, especially when one is inside the relationship, and getting clarity about the characteristics is important. What I find troubling is Elgin's tendency to simplify the dynamic, suggesting that the abuse will be stopped if only the recipient of the abuse responds in the right way. That is exactly what his/her abuser has been saying all along! This easily becomes a form of &quot;blame the victim&quot; which most victims of abuse struggle with anyway. They are told they are at fault by their abuser, and now here's another book telling them that if they just communicated in the right way, they wouldn't be abused. They don't need yet another voice telling them they could fix things if they were only good enough. Patricia Evans' book, The Verbally Abusive Relationship, provides more insight into the dynamic in a more helpful way that does not blame the victim. To quote Evans, &quot;The problem is the problem, and the problem is abuse.&quot;"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I agree with the reviewer who says that Elgin oversimplifies. It just isn't that easy. The \\"Jerry\\" in her examples seems positively malicious to me, no matter how much Elgin insists that he really loves his wife. With love like that, I'd hate to see loathing! The answer to systematic verbal abuse of this kind--constant erosion of another person's self-esteem by belittling and criticizing, and not only in private but in front of others--is intensive counseling, not mastery of slick responses to throw the attacker off guard. I have a hard time imagining Jerry, as Elgin portrays him, falling for any of these devices and backing off. And I know that men like Jerry exist, because I am presently in the process of divorcing one. If they are determined to hurt you, and to blame you for their failures, they will find a way.On the other hand, the book is excellent when it comes to helping you communicate more effectively with people with whom you aren't intimate and have less emotional capital invested. You may catch yourself falling into the kind of verbal cadences, sarcasm, brown-nosing, and so on, that Elgin describes. I found good info on how to reprimand my children too, without blowing up and verbally beating them into the ground..."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"This writer seems to assume that all verbal abuse stems from miscommunication and that with work from both sides it can be stemmed and that the pain the abusers inflict is only what we perceive it to be. Hogwash. She doesn't seem to take into account that some people are totally mentally incapable of being rational in the heat of their anger. Is it not possible that pain is exactly what the abusers want to inflict? While it does give some valuable ideas of how to deal with &quot;difficult&quot; people and situations and lighterweight marital difficulties, it does not give very realistic advice for a deeply abusive marital relationship. In my own experience, I'd love to know what response Ms. Elgin would have given to my husband who on the day after I had come home from the hospital after giving birth 2 days earlier, walked into the kitchen after work and saw me holding our newborn son while I was cooking dinner at the stove and our 18 month old daughter playing on the floor and remarked &quot;I figured dinner wouldn't be ready&quot; and then proceded into a temper tantrum because his immediate needs were not met. Was my response supposed to be: Honey, I know you've had a hard day at work and you've felt the stress of adding another child to our family too - but things just can't quite be the same for a little while because I need to get used to caring for 2 children now, a newborn baby and an 18 month old child at the same time, - so that is why I'm late with dinner tonight and it was not on the table the minute you stepped into the kitchen. Does Ms. Elgin really believe that a man who is so insensitive to his wife's needs (perhaps she was tired after giving birth 3 days ago and had emotional needs as well) could possibly interact with his wife in a sane and emotionally mature way? In all actuality - I did say something akin to the &quot;perfect&quot; response above, but it didn't make a bit of difference. His intent was to make me feel pain and to put his feeling of stress and pain upon me. It would be wonderful advice if all verbal abusers were rational people - but they are not. I only wish it were so easy."},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","review":"I highly recommend this book as an introduction to dealing with verbal abuse. I've found it helpful in two ways 1) I've become more aware of the hidden verbal attacks in common English phrases and have stopped using them myself. This has resulted in my having better relationships with people. 2) I've learned some win/win methods of responding to verbal abuse. This frequently stops the abuse while maintaining good relations with the abuser.I found the techniques especially helpful when I was teaching a high school class. A student would verbally attack me or another student. I would respond with a verbal self-defense technique from the book. The student couldn't believe the attack didn't work (I wasn't enticed into a fight.) and would try the same attack again. After the second attempt, the student realized the attack wasn't going to work and stopped.(Note: Verbal self-defense is for dealing with sane people. An insane person, a sadist or criminal who enjoys harming people, should be referred to a professional.)"},{"Title":"The River Cafe-wine Primer","review":"Joseph DeLissio's new offering has it all--well-organized information and an attractive, easy-to-use format in a book everyone can afford (and can lift).

So often the subject of wine can be intimidating and pretentious, but Mr. DeLissio's obvious passion for the grape makes this book immediately accessible and a delight to read. Suitable for both the novice and the more experienced wine drinker, this graphically-pleasing book gives a great explanation about each grape type and offers some very practical advice on purchasing wine at a store or ordering at a restaurant. After reading this book I was inspired to approach wine with a completely different attitude and have already enjoyed many delicious bottles thanks to Mr. DeLissio's excellent recommendations."},{"Title":"The River Cafe-wine Primer","review":"Delissio's &quot;River Cafe Wine Primer&quot; is a nice place to start for the beginning oenophile. It reads easily, for the most part, and never insults the reader. The author joins the &quot;all things are possible&quot; attitude, leaving the appreciation of wine to the reader, while providing guideposts for enjoyment. Never is the reader talked down to, but neither is the author willing to keep his advice on a lowest common denominator level.This book has an insider's information and I found some of the restaurant and background info on par with Boudrain's &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, but with a dash more restraint. I'm not sure if the wine industry has the kind of dirt that Boudrain exposes, but the novelistic style of Delissio's book still makes it a worthy read.Where this primer fails is not so much the fault of the book, but rather in its competition. Zraly's wine course book and MacNeil's &quot;The Wine Bible&quot; are superior. The Zraly book is very basic, while MacNeil's is far more thorough. One reviewer noted how well Delissio clarified the wines of France, but I found his tour to be more confusing than similar discussions in the other two books. The sidenotes and fun facts in Zraly, and the ebullient, &quot;zest for life&quot; attitude of MacNeil also take them one step above &quot;The River Cafe Wine Primer&quot;.Another significant lack is that due to the writing style and the book's layout, it doesn't function well as a reference. In other words, it wouldn't be a book I would reach for if I had a question. Delissio avoids naming names - his wine recommendations are more generalized. This works well for a book that will probably not go through several revisions, but again, it makes it harder to use for specific help.A nice day read, &quot;The River Cafe Wine Primer&quot; is a fine addition for wine lovers who seek to round out their knowledge, but in a crowded market of wine books, there are other more essential books to add to one's library."},{"Title":"The River Cafe-wine Primer","review":"An amazing book! Mr. Delissio's, The River Cafe Wine Primer,is a must have for anyone serious about wine. The information given is easy, even for the novice to understand.

I only wish that there were more writers with Delissio's passion."},{"Title":"The River Cafe-wine Primer","review":"While I have always liked wine I have always hated the arrogance of most people who sell wine. Be it the cocky wine shop clerk or the restaurant wine whatever you call them guys with the silly silver cup, they seldom make me feel like my opinion means anything. They make me feel stupid! That has all changed since I have read The Wine Primer. While I did not buy the Wine Primer, (it was a gift from a woman who has become my ex woman) I love the power and comfort it has given me.Best of all this book saves me money. I didnt know wine shops give quantity discounts until I read it in the Wine Primer. I tried it out when I bought six bottles of wine in my local wine shop when at checkout, I asked if there was any multiple bottle discount- to my surprise there was, 10 % to be exact. I havesaved over a hundred dollars since I read of this tip in The River Cafe Wine Primer.I like red wine with almost every thing I eat. Once at a well known restaurant I ordered a French red Bordeaux with my Tuna and was given a three minute lecture by \\"The Wine Guy\\" on how itas a horrible match. Needless to say I was so intimidated I changed my order. Here I am I'm thirty four years old, I own my own buisness, my own home, repair my boat and car by myself, and coach a little leaugue soccer team, and I found my self embarrassed to have red wine with Tuna. Mr. Delissio says in his book that \\"the only palate one ever needs to impress is his own\\" and puts it in a way that you believe it.There is a saying in the bible that if you teach a man to fish you will never have to feed him. The River Cafe Wine Primer has taught me how to let myself enjoy my own tastes, and after reading it I find that when it comes to wine I don't need any help. Best of all it keeps saving me money.I recommend everyone learn how to fish and read this book."},{"Title":"The River Cafe-wine Primer","review":"As a mere advanced beginner in the world of wine enjoyment, I find this book to be among the best I have explored to educate myself.

Imagine that you have a great friend or associate who knows the world of wine inside and out and you ask him to write down some advice for you, and you'll get an idea of the easy style you'll find here...only expanded tenfold. This book is laid out thoughtfully and is bursting with the kind of practical advice that can only reflect a deep love for the subject matter.

Shipp has done an outstanding service in furthering the understanding of this biblical text."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"Author John Lubetkin has done an excellent job pulling together a widely diverse stockpile of sources and developing in-depth and unique look at the ill-fated attempt to construct the Northern Pacific Railroad in the early 1870s as America's second transcontinental rail link. Other books in the past have extracted the best-known portion of the series of events that constitute this story, namely Custer's 1873 Yellowstone Expedition as recounted in biographies of Custer and Sitting Bull as well as works from the late Larry Frost and John Carroll. The strength of Lubetkin's work lies in its all inconclusive disection of Jay Cooke and his Northern Plains Railroad dream which in no ways detracts from the military events that many of us find so compelling.In the late 1860s, Cooke had reached the apex of America's banking world, having financed the Union war effort in the Civil War, funding that was crucial in the ultimate victory. He backed the dream, dormant since its 1864 charter, of creating the Northern Pacific Railroad running from Duluth, Minnesota across Dakota Territory, through Montana, Idaho, and ending in the Pacific Northwest.The author's engaging style and in-depth research combine as he takes us back in time to the full context of the Gilded Age. We witness the brilliant Cooke as he ably finances his dream through repeated bond sales but the reality of what was being paid for soon begins to take its toil--poor management, gross overspending and corruption by those under Cooke, the unanticipated engineering challenges of laying a railroad through Minnesota's boggy, swampy terrain and, ultimately, the will of the the Lakota in resisting the railroad through their prime hunting grounds.History is fortunate that former Confederate General Tom Rosser was the chief engineer on the 1871 Whistler Expedition and the 1872 Rosser-Stanley Eastern Yellowstone Expedition as well as served at the start of the 1873 Expedition where he was reunited with former West Point classmate, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The author has delved deep into Rosser's diaries and correspondence from the manuscript repository holdings of the University of Virginia. For those like myself with an interest in the Indian Wars, the large section of this book devoted to these expeditions will prove compelling. An entire chapter is devoted to the 1872 Battle of Poker Flats and is absoluelty fascinating, especially the description of Sitting Bull's calculated act of courage of sitting on the ground, smoking his pipe as soldier's bullets failed to hit him as the battle concluded.All of this culminates with the 1873 Expedition which proved necessary since staunch Lakota resistance prevented the 1872 foray from completing the survey. The author argues that Eastern newspaper coverage of the intractable Lakotas begin to slowly but surely unnerve Eastern investors who became more and more concerned over the feasiblity of a railroad through hostile territory, a concern that would explode in September 1873 with the worst possible results. The military responded to the 1872 difficulties by sending Custer's 7th Cavalry to the Northern Plains, thus giving the 1873 survey an offensive capability lacking in the infantry companies. This act also placed Custer and his regiment into the heart of the most untamed portion of the country where Custer's 1876 demise would carry him and the 7th Cavalry beyond the realm of history and into legend. Separate chapters on Custer's August 4, 1873 battle near the Yellowstone/Tongue River confluence and the larger battle a week later near the Big Horn/Yellowstone junction do full justice to these events as well as ably demonstrate Custer's ability in Indian warfare. Readers will be somewhat surprised as well as enlightened by the more positive picture of General David Stanley, Custer's superior on the expedition, as he has generally been written off as a hopeless drunk. As this book reveals though, he was able to command effectively when the situation demanded and there is far more to him than my previous knowledge had encompassed.The book concludes with the return of the 1873 Expedition, the final survey complete but its results of little use until the end of the decade when the railroad was finally completed by a Northern Pacific under different management. For in September 1873, judgement day arrived for both Jay Cooke and Company as well as the U.S. economy as a \\"Panic\\" was unleashed on Wall Street, numerous banks, including Cooke's, failed and work on the Northern Pacific ground to a halt, dragging the nation into the depths of a depression that at least one economic historian has judged as second only to the 1929-1932 Great Depression. The author makes the argument that the reports of Custer's two battles, despite their small size and the success of Custer and his regiment, were the last straw in undermining investor confidence in the safety of the area that the railroad was trying to cross.Excellent and numerous maps by Vicki Trego Hill are included throughout this book and their quality is such that even the most difficult to please cartographer will be satisfied. If there is anything that the author can be faulted on, it is for not including more of the William Pywell photographs from the 1873 expedition but I have to remind myself that this book is on the entire Northern Pacific Railroad effort, not just the Custer expedition. For those wishing to view these photographs as well as gain additional, in-depth, excellent insight into the 1873 Expedition, see Lawrence Frost's CUSTER'S 7TH CAVALRY AND THE CAMPAIGN OF 1873, out of print but available wherever fine rare books are sold, including Amazon as of this writing."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"History tends to be written in \\"silos:\\" there is political history, military history and so forth. If a history in one sphere incorporates history in another, the other sphere tends to get short shrift. But real history isn't like that. Political history begets military history which in turn is influenced by the history of technology which itself is determined by financial history.Mr. Lubetkin has chosen a seemingly minor historical event - the surveying expeditions of the Northern Pacific Railroad - and created an engaging combination of numerous areas of history, in the course of which he illustrates how minor events have a ripple effect which can have a major impact on the course of nations.One of the authors real skills is the ability to think through the motives of historical characters. Sometimes the historical record is clear, sometimes the author has to resort to speculation (always clearly marked as such, unlike the tendency of a lot of modern historians). This makes the narrative very alive and places the reader into the middle of the events described.Like most books today, the editing leaves something to be desired and the author makes some intriguing charges about J.P. Morgan which I would have liked him to document better (a photo caption alleges that Morgan aided the South during the Civil War - everyone knows about the Hall Carbine scandal, but that was just a classic example of shoddy; was there more? - and claims that Morgan may have deliberately undermined a US government bond sale in order to damage Cooke).But these are minor quibbles in a book which takes the reader from the Big Horn River to Washington DC to Philadelphia to Burlington Vermont and manages to pull them all together."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"This is one of those special books that is virtually impossible to put down once you start reading. Written in a highly readable, narrative style that puts the reader in the time and place being depicted, this book is the story of Jay Cooke's attempt to build a second transcontinental railroad, known as the Northern Pacific. Present readers may recognize its successor, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad that just happens to be the largest private landholder in the United States. An integral part of the story is the creation of Yellowstone National Park, the forced Canadian-British effort to build the Canadian Pacific transcontinental railroad, the Panic of 1873, the instigation of the Great Sioux War, and most interestingly, the link between Cooke and George Armstrong Custer that brought him back from the South and, as is said, the rest is history. This is a worthy addition to both national and regional history."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"Every so often a new author plumbs old tales with fresh insight, interpretation and newly discovered research and does so in a way that his analysis intertwines biography with the totality of the historic events and times that were the person's life. Such is the case with John Lubetkin's Jay Cooke's Gamble. As the book's subtitle describes, who would have thought Sitting Bull directly contributed to a severe US financial panic. But that is exactly what happened: Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railroad touched off a Sioux War that caused the Panic of 1873.Seeking a new challenge after financing the North's portion of the US Civil War, Cooke embarks on a new undertaking that is nothing less than the construction of a second transcontinental railroad, a northern route stretching from Duluth, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington. In the process he reignites war with the Sioux, rescues George Armstrong Custer from obscurity, creates Yellowstone National Park, sets off a wave of Northern European immigration, pushed frontier settlement 400 miles further westward, halted western Canada's drift into the US orbit, triggered the Panic of 1873 and spurred JP Morgan's rise.This is an absolutely wonderful story, excellently crafted, beautifully written and supported by quality maps. It manages to fit the construction of the Northern Pacific within the environment it transcended, the West, with the East, the area within which it was managed and financed. It includes ugly politics, shady dealing, illegal activities, larger than life personalities, Indian warfare, dishonesty and all of the other negatives one could expect from a swashbuckling story that spans not only a continent but the Atlantic Ocean as well. Lubetkin's suspenseful narrative describes events played out from Wall Street to the Yellowstone and Germany's Paletine while vividly portraying the soldiers, engineers, businessmen, politicians and Native Americans who alternately seek to build, stop or destroy the construction of the Northern Pacific.A good tale well told make no mistake: This man can write!"},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"Jay Cooke's Gamble covers important background into the North pacific Railroad's history. It does not focus much on the actual railroad operations, but rather the financing and surveying behind the scenes. The author writes in a very readable style and does his subject justice.The reader will be transported to a time when railroads determined settlement of the American interior. But before the roads could be built, the land had to be surveyed, and in this case the land was also still occupied by natives who wished to preserve their traditional way of life. The reader will encounter a cast of characters ranging from the venerable Jay Cooke himself, to General Geoerge Armstrong Custer, and all the important NP company engineers and surveyors in between. Some were drunkards (the author appears to have a strong bias against alcohol), some prone to mismanagement, and some, like Cooke, never set foot in the land where the action took place. All of this makes for a very entertaining and informative read. One statistic does stand out as being a possible typo: the author on page 274 states land in Bismarck, Dakota was selling for as much as $8000/acre. That figure appears high.But this is a very good book. One hopes the author will continue on and write the history of the railroad after Cooke's demise and the Northern Pacific's ultimate completion and beyond to its eventual merger with the Great Northern and CB&Q;."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"Mr. Lubetkin's work is well researched and well written. He's able to weave a narrative together that brings the beginning of the Gilded Age to the Indian Wars and railroad construction... frankly, I had never made the connection between the Northern Pacific and Sitting Bull until I read this book.However, the final conclusions made me question the depth of the research. Lubetkin identifies the completion of the Northern Pacific several years later, and its competition with the Great Northern, whose surveyors \\"found\\" Marias Pass. There is no mention of the railroads' cooperation and attempted merger, nor the landmark Sumpreme Court case concerning Northern Securities and the creation of the ICC. Oh yes, and with reference to the previous review of the map quality, it would have been nice had the book included a larger map or two of the entire proposed routes.I still believe Pierre Berton's The Last Spike (Canadian Pacific) to be the standard against all railroad construction history books should be measured. If Berton rates a 10, this book is an 8."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"John Lubetkins literary genious is always very well transferred to his books. I highly recommend all of his books. He puts lots of research into his books and it really shows in the quality and the details. You wont regret picking up any of his books."},{"Title":"Jay Cooke's Gamble: The Northern Pacific Railroad, The Sioux, And the Panic of 1873","review":"I was expecting the title to be followed closely. This was not the case. It is a very detailed and exhaustively researched book on the Northern Pacific railroad, its construction and the cast of characters (Gen. Custer included) who were associated with it. It gives only very brief coverage of the Panic of 1873 (this is not a similar book as the \\"Panic of 1907\\", covering a similar event of another time). The Sioux get bit more coverage but only as they relate to the Railroad construction. A bit more detail about them in a general sense would have been useful. If you are looking for railroad history in the US, with some colorful charachters like Custer, this is your book. If you are looking for a book with an economic and markets bent, as it relates to the 1873 Panic and its aftermath or the history of the Sioux, you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Linguistic Anthropology (Basic anthropology units)","review":"I don't really agree with either of the other reviews -- I find this to be a good introduction to linguistic anthropology, not too high level (certainly not as dense as similar books by Duranti or others). It's short enough that I can use it in a survey course and still have room for some articles and perhaps an ethnography. It covers all the major areas without going into so much detail than non-majors will get lost or fed up. It may be \\"cheap\\" inasmuch as there are no color photos, but I appreciate that such measures keep the price down. However, the lack of an index and a glossary are indeed significant drawbacks.I was assigned the first edition of this book when I was a student.

Just the fact that the book revolves around a rag-tag superteam composed of people with some people with almost useless powers (or none at all) is funny enough, but then they get into some ridiculous situations that made me literally laugh out loud. Unfortunately, then they start to deal with some more serious topics and issues that kind of hurt the initial feel of the book. It is certainly a memorable book though, so much that I even went out and got the second one later on."},{"Title":"Freshmen Volume 1","review":"This book is fun. It's not over the top slapstick humor or full of witty conversations, but it is pretty fun. It's really well drawn by Leonard Kirk, who I remember from his great run on Peter David's Supergirl, and is written by Hugh Sterbakov, who I never heard of. Hugh mentions in his afterword that co-creator Seth Green is his best pal...so I think we all know how he broke into the field. The book is labelled Volume 1, but the story has a real ending and sequels, although welcome, aren't needed to enjoy the book.The story: You've got a bunch of stereotypical college freshmen (except for the Amish guy and the beaver) (yeah, I just wrote the line \\"Amish guy and the beaver\\" in a review) who find themselves living in the school's science building due to a dorm shortage (except for the beaver - he is there for another reason).When a science experiment on another floor misfires, the freshmen, and the aforementioned beaver, are all given super-powers related to whatever was on their mind at the instant of the misfire. It works out pretty well for the chick who was wondering how to get into other people's heads. But not so well for the guy looking at a squirrel or the guy who was measuring his, um, well, ahem, let's just call it his 'shortcoming'.Anyhow, they all get drawn into a plot involving some bad guys and in the process turn into a super-hero team led by an uber-comic-book-geek who ironically happened to be out of the dorm at that critical moment when the others gained their powers.The book collects the complete six issue miniseries, some art in progress pages, alternate covers, some pinups, introductions by Seth and Hugh, character bios and a short prose wrap-up story.I don't think I'd give this book to anyone under the age of 14 or so since it does involve frank depictions of college age topics like sex and drinking. But for the super-hero fan looking for something lighthearted it's a good read and it is completely accesible to those who don't read other comics."},{"Title":"Freshmen Volume 1","review":"One of the greatest origin comics of our time.

If you are comic hater, read Ambush Bug it is so full of comicbook references you will burn your copy and increase the value of mine. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Freshmen Volume 1","review":"I got the origin trade paperback for 'Freshmen' last month. I just figured I'd give it a shot because I like Seth Green. I am VERY glad I did. That comic had me hooked right away. The characters are all cool, funny, and likable. Wannabe makes for a great unlikely hero, and I love his costume. Puppeteer is a fascinating character, I loved a scene in one issue in which she uses her power to help a comatose friend come to grips with some of her worst memories. Intoxicator was a very funny guy who has some of the best lines in the book, and his power would make for an excellent weapon when you think about it. As a Christian, I really, really liked the character Quaker. Even though the portrayal of Amish life probably isn't very accurate (I don't know much about Amish culture), I liked the fact that, although his naivete about the world and modern technology is mocked at times, his faith is NOT. During an issue in which the narration is provided by him writing a letter to his family, he at one point makes a very astute and hard- hitting observation about what crude, decadent, and generally unhappy and unfulfilling lives many of his classmates lead, compared to the harmonious life in Amish country he was used to. I LOVED the scene in the final issue in which he finally uses his amazing earthquake power, it probably ranks up as one of my all- time favorite moments in a comic book. In addition to having such likable heroes, the villains are quite effective as well. Dr. Tomlinson comes across as a man who is not necessarily evil, just someone with his priorities messed up. He shows the consequences of the reckless pursuit of science without having proper morals and ethics to guide you. The Frat Guys, in contrast, ARE evil. They were cruel bullies even before getting their powers, but after getting them, they became complete barbarians whose blatant bloodlust made them VERY scary.The only real problem I have is that some of the characters could have been given a LOT more use and exploration, most notably Cacophony, who was barely even in it before leaving.So, in summary, I most definitely recommend 'Freshmen,' it is an amazing comic and a proud member of my collection."},{"Title":"Customs & Etiquette of Thailand (Simple Guides Customs and Etiquette)","review":"Handy pocket size book, 75 page guide on basic manners and behaviour.Gift idea for first-time visitors to Thailand."},{"Title":"Le Trone de Fer T2 - Le Donjon Rouge (Science Fiction) (French Edition)","review":"Cette s&eacute;rie constitue la plus r&eacute;ussie depuis celles de Tolkien, David Eddings (Belgariade) et Tad Williams (L'Arcane des &Eacute;p&eacute;es).

Besides the regular use of the new gender-neutral language (e.g. avoiding translation of \\"man\\" and \\"he\\" in thousands of places), it features many dubious renderings that obscure the teachings of the Bible concerning the role of women in the family.Galatians 3:28 is given an egalitarian spin with the rendering \\"Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other, whether you are ... a man or a woman\\" (the original text says \\"In Christ there is no ... male or female\\" with respect to salvation, but there is no statement that all Christians are made equal in any other respect).In Genesis 2:18, Eve is called not a \\"helper\\" but a \\"partner\\" of Adam; in 1 Peter 3:1, Colossians 3:18 and Ephesians 5:22 women are advised somewhat ambiguously to \\"put their husbands first\\" rather than told to \\"submit\\" to them [...] certainly does mean \\"submit,\\" and it is adequately rendered \\"obey\\" elsewhere in the CEV); in 1 Corinthians 11:10 the CEV says a woman should wear a head covering not merely as a \\"sign of authority\\" (i.e. her husband's authority, nearly all commentators agree) but \\"as a sign of her authority.\\" The tendency in all this is clear enough--an attempt is made to tone down the 'patriarchal' element in the Bible, and so readers are prevented from understanding these passages in ways that are likely to be offensive to many modern women.[...]"},{"Title":"The Promise Bible God's Words in Your Words (Comtemporary English Version)","review":"I have never read a Bible that is so easy to read in English and the paper qualilty and fonts are just the right size.

During his lifetime, and for about two decades after his death in 1974, he was one of the most popular authors in Britain. Interest in him reached a peak in the early 1990s when his \\"Larkin Family\\" novels were serialised on television. In my view, those are far from being his best works, but the series was a huge success, tapping as it did into a vein of rural nostalgia and introducing to public view the most beautiful young actress that Britain has produced for many years. Since then, however, that interest has declined and, apart from the Larkin books and one or two wartime stories, his works are now largely out of print.I had thought that \\"The Feast of July\\" was one of those neglected works, and was pleased to see it is still in print. Its setting is a small town in the East Midlands, probably during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The mood, however, is not one of nostalgia. Like Hardy's \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", the book deals with a young unmarried mother who is abandoned by her seducer and whose child dies in infancy. While searching for her lover, the heroine, Bella Ford, arrives as a homeless and friendless stranger in town, where she is rescued and befriended by Ben Wainwright, a shoemaker, and his family. (Shoemaking is the principal industry of the area). Bella is welcomed into the family and becomes like a daughter to them, especially after their own daughter dies. Ben and his wife have three sons, and, after brief dalliances with the two younger boys, she eventually finds love with the eldest, Con. The climax of the story comes on the Feast of July, a traditional festival in the area, celebrating the first crops of the new season. Bella's lover Arch Wilson reappears in her life, provoking a confrontation that ends tragically.The novel is reminiscent of Hardy in more ways than one. There is the book's late Victorian/Edwardian setting (although it was not written until the 1950s). There is the triangular relationship between Bella, Con and Arch, which parallels that between Tess, Angel and Alec. Most importantly, there is Bates's deep love of the countryside, which he shares with the earlier writer. Although the Wainwrights live in an industrial town, it is small enough for the surrounding countryside to be an inescapable presence in the lives of its inhabitants. The Feast, second only to Christmas in importance in the area, is celebrated by town and country dwellers alike, and the townspeople are expected to set aside their normal work to join in the harvest. Throughout the book we are made aware of the changing of the seasons; most of the chapters start with a reference to the time of year, to the weather and to the changing landscape. (Winter, when the demand for shoes is depressed, is a time of hardship even for industrial workers). As in many of Bates's other novels, the beauty of countryside in its changing moods is described with what the Times Literary Supplement described as \\"lyrical intensity\\".It would be wrong to see this novel as merely a pastiche of Victorian writing. Bates's style is terse and urgent, rather than the more discursive style favoured in nineteenth century literature. As a result, this is a brief novel of about 200 pages; a Victorian novelist dealing with this theme would in all likelihood have done so at much greater length. This brevity of style has its drawbacks. The characters are less developed than they would have been in a longer work; Arch Wilson, in particular, is a two-dimensional figure, a plot device rather than a believable character (whereas Alec d'Urberville emerges as a complex and credible human being). Nevertheless, brevity has its advantages as well. By concentrating on the essentials, Bates develops his plot with a speed and urgency that gives the impression of events rushing to a headlong climax and makes the culminating tragedy seem all the more terrible and inevitable.This, then, is a fine piece of writing, evidence that Bates deserves to be remembered as more than the creator of the dreary Larkin clan and as the man who unwittingly gave her big break to Catherine Zeta Jones. Let us hope that the recent decision by ITV to repeat The Darling Buds of May will lead to a revival of interest in Bates generally. The publishers could help by reissuing some of his other novels (Love for Lydia, The Distant Horns of Summer and The Jacaranda Tree are examples that come to mind)."},{"Title":"Hannah Rose (Ahab's Legacy)","review":"Louise Gouge does an exellent job of combining history, romance and spirituality while tackling the tough issue of slavery.

In her beautiful historical voice that so exactly captures the late 1840's, Gouge draws the reader further into the sympathetic plight of Captain Ahab's young widow. In this continuation of her saga, Hannah Rose blossoms, forced by the diametrical differences between two suitors to question more deeply God's will for not only her own life, but mankind in general. A very human Hannah labors to protect her son from the ramifications of his father's actions, while coming face to face with her own predjudices.

When she moves to Boston to visit friends before leaving for a long-awaited trip to Europe, Hannah is torn between two very different men whose attentions force her against her will to confront her convictions about slavery and her relationship with God.This subtle, delicately drawn story beckons the reader into the vivid world of mid nineteenth-century Boston at a time when the tide of opposition to slavery was swelling. In Hannah, Gouge has created a truly memorable, flesh-and-blood character, and the suspenseful romance kept me turning the pages to see which man she would choose. I couldn't help identifying with Hannah's love for her son and her desire to keep him safe, her affection and loyalty for her friends, and at the same time her deep hunger to finally set out on the adventure her heart had craved for so long.Gouge affectingly portrays the maturing of Hannah's spiritual nature through a confrontation with profound issues that still resonate today.

Left with a son to raise alone, Hannah has fled Nantucket and the bittersweet memories of her marriage to Ahab, and to protect her son from the angry people whose lives were destroyed by Ahab's insane rage against a white, rogue whale.Hiding her true identity from all but a select few, Hannah leaves her refuge at her cousin's home in Indiana to visit dear friends in Boston, after which she and Timothy fulfill her life-long dream to travel - see the world.But things don't turn out quite the way she planned. While in Boston, Hannah finds herself involved with the mission work conducted by Jeremiah Harris, a former suitor, and his wife Kerenhappuch, both now dear friends and steadfast Christians. The work severely challenges Hannah, who finds it both rewarding and conflicting. She had long since given up on prayer. It had availed her nothing when she trusted God to take care of Ahab. Now, she trusted only herself.As she reluctantly takes on some work that Kerenhappuch can no longer handle, Hannah comes face to face with a life she never dreamed existed. She does things she never imagined she'd be willing to do, and finds a slow-dawning gratification through her efforts. Then her oldest and dearest friend gets Hannah involved with the Abolitionists and helping escaped slaves from the pre-Civil War South.Her life becomes even more interesting when she meets two handsome and charming men, though their life-styles and attitudes are diametrically opposed: a dashing, naval captain and slave-owner from Virginia, and the strong, steadfast captain who knows who Hannah really is.Tensions mount as her son Timothy gets older and shows more and more that he is Ahab's son. How can she protect him from his own inherited nature and the truth about his father? More importantly, will Hannah realize God's plans for her as she sees the deep faith and sacrifice of her friends? Can she learn to trust Him again?HANNAH ROSE is one of those books that is close to impossible to put down. Rich with the history of nineteenth century Boston, you are skillfully drawn into the era and the lives of the people that lived during that time. This is good reading, great history and excellent writing. Louise Gouge has earned all the praise I can give this book.

Gouge was writing her dissertation novel, not really expecting to ever publish it. (One assumes that the critical and commercial success of Naslund'sAhab's Wife: Or, The Star-gazer: A Novellead Gouge's editor and agent to push her into polishing it up for publication as her third book.) What resulted was the Ahab's Legacy trilogy, of which this is the second volume.You might think it unfair to compare the two, and you'd be right but for the wrong reasons. Naslund'sEveryone Loves Una; Or, The Navel-Gazer: A Mary Sue, as I call it, is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish. In contrast the Ahab's Legacy trilogy was a pleasure to read.Similarities abound, both authors having decided that an unconventional girl was needed to win old Ahab's heart, but profound differences exist that make for interesting comparison and contrast. Thus, while Una is a laughably absurd prodigy, Hannah is simply a woman slightly ahead of her time due to an unconventional upbringing as the doted on only child of a devoted widower. While Una basks in the worship of mid-nineteenth century New England's thoughtful elites, Hannah reads their books, attends their lectures, and finds her thinking profoundly influenced by them. While Una leaps into the anti-slavery cause, along with every other trendy cause, without a moment's hesitation, Hannah agonizes for half the book over whether a widow with a small child dares to actively assist the Underground Railroad, despite her growing conviction of slavery's evil. Compared to unintentionally hilarious Una, Hannah comes across as only slightly more modern than everyone else, an all too human figure.This second volume is about her attempts to cope with the aftermath of his death and raise their son alone.Note: Louise M. Gouge is a devout Christian, and Christian themes are explored throughout the novels so if Christianity gives you a rash, you have been warned. However, to her credit, Gouge does little preaching and never gets preachy.The first book of the trilogy isAhab's Bride, and the final book of the trilogy isSon of Perdition."},{"Title":"Hannah Rose (Ahab's Legacy)","review":"I have purchased all 3 books from the Ahab Series and read them immediately.

Anyway, I put this book down feeling as if this author has written much of this before. Just can't remember where. So I don't rate it as highly as some other books I have read about the Holocaust. In terms of personal memoirs I recommend Stefan Petelycky's Into Auschwitz, For Ukraine. It's the true story of a Holocaust survivor, Auschwitz #154922, and a Ukrainian patriot.

As a consequence, the descriptions can be misleading. As an example, how to remove the transmission does not totally cover the necessary operations since for a 4WD, you have to refer to remove the transfer case which ignores the actual gearbox. You will end up taking out first the transfer case and then the gearbox when in fact you may wish to remove them together.Some electrical diagrams are impossible to read because once again, different models are referred to on the same diagram resulting in a total confusion of lines. In addition, petrol, gas and diesel options are included on the same electrical diagram as well as automatic and manual options.There are omissions and also many repeats of information and diagrams about the same item in different parts of the text. There is no coverage at all of the front differential in a 4WD for instance.I defy any of the authors, who reputedly carried out all the operations they describe to test the validity of a procedure, to successfully follow their own directions.All in all, the most useful part of this manual are the specs, ie torque figures, oil specs etc but even then, there are discrepancies.

It's a great book for me!!I'm very happy to have it in my library."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I grew up in St. Joseph, Michigan. While it would be difficult for any author who is not a resident to capture the sentiment of a community in which he did not live, I think Mr. Kotlowitz's attempts to understand the differences between St. Joseph and Benton Harbor are well-intended. To be sure this book has its faults and biases (as do both cities in the book), but overall I felt it captured the striking differences on both sides of the river (though not the subtle similarities). It was, at times, uncomfortable for me to read such an analysis of my home town - especially when recognizing some of the names. But this was a good read.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about how a community (and yes St. Joseph/Benton Harbor make up 1 community, not 2) can divide itself. In this case, the division was an easy one to recognize - a river and two races.This book certainly had a impact on me. Being about my home, I felt obligated to read this - and am glad I did. I can't say whether ot not it would have the same impact on those who have not lived in these cities, but it does provide an interesting light on lingering suspicions."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a resident of Benton Harbor, I read with great interest Alex Kotlowitz's &quot;The Other Side of the River&quot;. As a white person who spent my entire childhood in Stevensville (the community directly adjacent to St. Joseph), was educated there, was insulated there, and who was influenced by the subtle but constant undercurrent of racism there... only to find myself moving to the &quot;other side&quot; of the river for the last 16 years, I can tell you that Alex Kotlowitz absolutely captured the state of race relations in and around the &quot;Twin Cities&quot;... and probably most of the country. The author does not climb up on a soapbox, agenda in hand, and tell the reader what they should think. Instead, he lets the facts speak for themselves. The result that this book has caused many in the white St. Joseph community to go howling in protest, railing against this &quot;unfair&quot; portrayal, only goes to show that bare facts apparently don't leave much cover for those who would like to hide their fear, loathing, and head-in-the-sand refusal to believe there's a problem, behind a pretty tourist brochure facade. Painfully even-handed, the book does not exactly paint a pretty picture of either the white OR the black communities involved. Rather, it offers a map of several incidents and betrayals that have led these two towns to such a sorry state. That there can be no real conclusion to this book leaves the reader to think about their own prejudices and assumptions. It also leads you to wonder if there can ever be a conclusion to the race problems in our country as a whole... which is perhaps at least a first step to getting there -- just THINKING about it at all! I do wish Alex Kotlowitz would return to the area and look into the community of Fairplain - the only truly integrated area between the two towns. How does this community survive? Because it is made up of working people, all of the same basic socio-economic make-up? Because the people have adopted a &quot;live &amp; let live&quot; attitude? Or because they know the problems of either side of the river, and have tried to make a place where they may not live like kings, but at least they're allowed to live with some dignity. Do read &quot;The Other Side of the River&quot;. It will make you think!"},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am a white resident of St. Joseph, Michigan. . .a transplant, not a native. We moved here in June 1991, just as the Eric McGinnis story hit the headlines. I was outraged by what I read in the papers about it then and the rumors I heard around &quot;White St. Joe,&quot; not because I believed he had been lynched, but because the bigotry and misunderstanding on both sides of the river were so apparent. And now comes this book by a distinguished author. . .let me tell you, St. Joseph residents on the whole were not happy about what he wrote. However, it is accurate from what I have read, heard, and know, with only a couple of insignificant errors which don't affect the story. I'm glad I finally read Kotlowitz's book, because it caused quite a stir around here and has really made the townsfolk reevalute racial relations, in spite of their bellyaching. And I believe it should be mandatory reading for every resident in both of these monotone hamlets. I can never cross the river again without thinking of Eric, imagining him struggling against the currents, and thinking of the symbolism of that image."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A number of people have covered race relations in the U.S and in a number of different ways; however, Kotlowitz still manages to find a fresh take on the matter.I grew up in a small community about a half-hour from Benton Harbor/St. Joe area, so I found the book especially interesting; however, the relationship between the &quot;twin cities&quot; that Kotlowitz discovers and explores is certainly not unique. Benton Harbor is a primarily black, lower-income city with a horrific crime problem while St. Joe is a primarily white, upper-middle class city with very little crime. The twin cities relationship is especially interesting because both communities are relatively small and only a river serves to divide. However, similar questions could be raised about the relationship between many urban areas and their suburbs.Kotlowitz is a journalist by training and that style of writing works well in the book. While we're hearing about a sociological problem, we're also being told a compelling story."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"The Other Side of the River\\" is a thought-provoking read. It seems reasonably unbiased, but appears eager to pigeonhole the characters and should have asked some deeper questions.Kotlowitz filled his book with two stock character types: black Benton Harbor residents suspicious and resentful of the surrounding whites, white St Joe residents who are either bumbling small town officials or overtly racist. This is too simplistic.I grew up in Stevensville (which Kotlowitz calls \\"Lakeshore\\", the name of our public school district), which borders St Joe to the south. It's incredibly hard to live there and not develop bad attitudes toward Benton Harbor. Benton Harbor's crime and unemployment rates are one of the worst in the state. Its local politics is a comedy of errors. The mostly white communities south of the river are certainly not wealthy, but comfortable and safe. Most of the residents across the river don't want to have racist attitudes, but are constantly bombarded with these contrasts. They'd love to see the situation change, but Benton Harbor often seems beyond hope. Most don't see anything they could do to help, so the easiest solution is to avoid the place and pretend it doesn't exist.Stereotyping everyone south of the river as a racist is just as bad as stereotyping all Benton Harbor residents as criminals. What Kotlowitz misses (just barely, for there are hints of it in his interviews with Jim Reeves and the McGinnis family) is that the vast majority of people on both sides of the river are good, honest, well-meaning folks who just don't know what to do about the situation.While Kotlowitz does establish that racism exists on both sides, he would have better served his readers by at least acknowledging the existance of deeper questions, such as \\"why?\\" or \\"So how do we fix it?\\"."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Two small Michigan towns, the disappearance of a young black man, and the ever-present societal issues of race and hatred. Alex Kotlowitz's narrative story, The Other Side Of The River is a well-written, well-researched account surrounding two small towns in southeastern Michigan separated only by a river, and the 1991 disappearance of high school student Eric McGinnis. This story deserves a four-star rating for its engrossing subject matter and look into the lives of people consumed by ignorance and hatred for their fellow man. The Other Side Of The River tells the true story surrounding the disappearance and death of Eric McGinnis. Alex kotlowitz, the author, spends five years investigating the situations surrounding his death. While investigating the death of Eric McGinnis, Kotlowitz uncovers a much larger theme, one of racial bigotry and ignorance that has divided these two towns for decades. Kotlowitz determines, from his research and speaking with residents of these towns, that ingrained feelings of hatred, stupidity and which side of the river is home greatly influences people's opinions of what really happened to Eric McGinnis. The Other Side Of The River is a wonderful book that exposes racism and fear, but also kindness and decency. At the same time the reader is left with many unanswered questions because the crime has not yet been solved. This books very universal theme will appeal to a broad audience.Through Kotlowitz's research he undoubtedly uncovers many underlying issues between Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, issues that go much deeper than Eric McGinnis's death. However, Kotlowitz also shows that not all of the residents share the same hateful feelings. For instance, when Amy Johnson, a St. Joseph dentist's wife suggested the start of a pen-pal program between Benton Harbor and St. Joseph high schools, she was turned down. She was told by school officials, \\"Well, if they start writing they might start talking on the phone.\\" This example speaks loudly of both the pure magnitude of ignorance and fear but also shows that there are good people out there who do not see a person for their color. Now we see where children get their feelings of racism, they are taught!Despite Kotlowitz's thorough investigation into the death of Eric, this book fails to answer a lot of questions. Most importantly, \\"How did Eric McGinnis die?\\" unfortunately the answers are not in this book, nor any book. The crime has not been solved. In the end, Kotlowitz offers the reader a few of his conclusions, but ultimately, because this is a true story, the reader is left feeling confused with a lot of yearning to know what really happened.Racism is a pretty universal issue that everyone has seen or experienced, so with that I feel like this book should appeal to a large audience. We are a society the loves human interest stories and true stories. People love to relate to stories they read, and this is an easy one to relate to, not necessarily the death of Eric, but just the different situations that occur and the reactions of the local people to those situations.In conclusion, The Other Side Of The River is a compelling and accurate portrayal of the issues we as a society deal with on a daily basis. Those who read this book are again reminded of the challenges our society faces to end racism. Hopefully what one takes from reading this book is a newfound passion, a passion to be apart of the race to end hatred. This passion, along with a feeling of urgency to make a difference is what one will carry with them long after this reading experience is over."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Chicago writer Alex Kotlowitz, known for his study of public housing families in There Are No Children Here, is drawn to the twin cities of St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, Michigan. One town is predominantly white, the other predominantly black. He interviews seemingly everybody in Southwest Michigan about the circumstances of the death of a black teenager. He appears more investigator than reporter but expertly fleshes out many colorful characters as he tells how this death, which otherwise would not have made news outside the area, helped polarize the community.

And you still can't put this book down!Alex Kotlowitz is a master story teller of a real life murder in a racially charged small town, geographically divided by a river but racially divided by mistrust and suspicion. His research is detailed and thorough, and the reader finds himself quickly immersed and emotionally invovled with the characters. Every character is complex and likeable.

But &quot;The Other Side of the River&quot; falls so far short of the very high standard he set with the marvelous &quot;There Are No Children Here&quot; that I can't help but feel let down. Beyond that, I found that this book meandered and drifted. It was as if the author had expected to uncover more clues to the truth (not just the mysterious death but to how different races can better get along, how communities in decline can solve their problems, etc) than he ended up finding. It struck me that he may have gotten pretty deep into his project when he found his material was not as profound or meaningful as he had expected. He kept up the shell of the story and the expectant, portentous tone, but never really delivered. I hope Kotlowitz will continue to explore these themes and subjects and I look forward to a third book that hits the mark like his first."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I want to agree with the other online reviewer who picked out the quote about the &quot;budding librarian&quot;. As a school librarian myself, one who does not wear glasses or button her shirts all the way too the top, I also know that Mr. Kotlowitz should know better. I would bet that he's used plenty of libraries in his research and if he can't find anything better to say about the people who've assisted him than that, shame on him. It was the one place in his otherwise fine book that made me question whether he was really as good a writer as I've thought.

I am white, and I have several Hispanic and black friends.

This forces upon us an inherent lapse in reason when deciding how justice may be found. Our ability to reason is something we must constantly refresh, or we are the less human. I suppose, contrary to feelings and what the eye tells us, my being &quot;white,&quot; and the color of someone else's skin, same or different, becomes irrelevant while we have command of our reasoning abilities.

It gives a perspective that lots of people tend to try and overlook. I lived in Benton Heights (suburb of Benton Harbor) until I was 12 years old and then in Berrien Springs (about eight miles from BH/SJ) until I went to college in 1978. Currently I have two family members in St Joseph, one in Berrien Springs, one in Sodus (about 2 miles from Benton Harbor)and one in Stevensville (2 miles from St. Joseph). Growing up in the area and then reading this book was apalling. When I grew up (born in 1960), I don't remember as much racial tension as this book touted. I now live in San Antonio, TX. I was in the BH/SJ area during Christmas '98 and that is when I read this book. I also went to church with my parents in Fairplain (very close to Benton Harbor). I looked around this church and could not believe what I saw. Every person in the church was caucasian. No hispanics, no asians, no blacks, no Indians. This was fairly close to a town that is 92% black. If the blacks don't even attend a local church - what can be said about the residents of the town. I couldn't believe some of the things that I read. I was so angry at the amount of racism that has surfaced in the area, I was seriously tempted to write a letter to the editor of the News Palladium to say that I am glad that I don't live in an area high in racial tension anymore. Where I live now - there are at least 4 different races living on my street - a culdesac with about 22 houses total. Everyone gets along - black, caucasian, asian, hispanic. Even though I grew up as a caucasian in Benton Heights (and even attended Hull School for 2 years which was mentioned in the book), I never felt that I was racist. It would have been easy to, but I guess that my belief that God made everyone did not allow me to hate anyone because of their race, religion, gender or any other bias. I just couldn't believe that all that stuff was happening in a place that I didn't think ever had racial problems. I knew Benton Harbor had a large black population but I didn't realize that it was 92% and that SJ was 95% white. I grew up thinking that racism was only in the deep south with the Rosa Parks bus incident and the separate drinking fountains and all of the bussing. I never saw that while growing up in the BH/SJ area."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book offers a true yet biased view of the incident that happened in Benton Harbor and St. Joseph. This is why:1. Kotlowitz interviews bystanders from Benton Harbor but not from St. Joseph. The only St. Joe residents quoted in his book are those somehow related to the case while Benton Harbor residents and their opinions abound.2. Kotlowitz often makes vague statements about the area that cannot be backed up with solid evidence. For example, Kotlowitz makes a statement to the effect &quot;It has been said that even God fled Benton Harbor during the white flight.&quot; My question is, who said that? Being a resident of this area I promise that I have never once heard that said. Rather, it is an oppurtunity for Kotlowitz to insert his opinion without claiming it.3. Kotlowitz makes generalizations about the people of Southwestern Michigan based loosely on coincidental facts and/or rumors. For example, the &quot;Go home FIPS&quot; commentary. It is possible that this could have happened and maybe occasionally does, but it is not as common or accepted at Kotlowitz would lead the reader to believe.4. Kotlowitz is not equal in his treatment of Benton Harbor Citizens and St. Joseph citizens. For example, he states that St. Joe residents claim to have moved out of Benton Harbor because of the crime and denounces this as racism. However, the mother of the victim in his book moved out of Benton Harbor for the same reason and he never commented on this as a racist gesture.I admit that at first I had a defensive knee jerk reaction to this book. However, I have since reread the book after moving away and gaining perspective on the situation. Racism is a problem in the area. Both sides have issues that Kotlowitz correctly addresses. My problem with the book is the style it is written in. I feel that it is inflaming and self congratulatory.Kotlowitz is talented at using slanted and sensationalist language in his book. However, this topic IS a worthy one to look at. I do not deny that he addresses an important problem to the area. I do believe that this book should be read with a grain of salt; as a journalist trying to to glamourize his story much like a small child who embellishes on the truth for a reaction. Although essentially true, it has been airbrushed and glittered to be a more satisfying story."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought this book for my parents since they own property north of Benton Harbor.

This book was a major disappointment. Clearly the author lacked the passion for this story that he had in his previous book. I'm not sure that this topic holds up as an accurate microcosm for race relations in middle America as it attempts to do so it's difficult to see why this would be an important text to anyone who didn't live in southwest Michigan.

This book is a disappointing second. The entire story is rambling and often has no discernible point. I'm sure this is much more meaningful for residents of the town.

After a few chapters it became evident that this book is about so much more. It is a first hand account of the attitudes and perceptions that people from different backgrounds have. It traces racial issues through the eyes of two towns that could not be more different form each other.

At times it is hard to believe that this story actually takes place in America. This book is relatively easy to read, which is a plus. The multitude of facts, opinions, theories, speculations and rumors makes this book hard to put down. Each chapter raises more questions, and answers fewer. This book also does a good job presenting a story from two very different perspectives. Both perspectives have their supporting elements and their holes. In the end the reader chooses which side of the story to believe, and utlimately which side of the river they more readily identify with. Overall, this book is worth taking the time to read."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think this book allows for an accurate look into an unfortunate and often true racial tensions that have long been ignored in this country. Kotlowitz has done his homework and presents a story in a hartfelt maner that will remain with the reader for a very long time to follow. I personally was asigned this book as required reading for a class on state and local government and would highly recomend that it becomes a part of high school required reading. The book makes you realy think about your own racial stereotypes and briefly allows you to see the same issue from a different perspective. I think we all feel the same seperation that these two towns have experienced at some point in our lives. Maybee we are all more similar to one anther than we think."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is well written and explores the racial and socioeconomic difference our society holds. I however find that it is similar in plot and theme to his previous book, There are no Children Here. I still recommend that this book be read in conjunction with the other, but not by itself."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Kotlowitz set out to investigate the mysterious death of Eric McGinnis, and ended up writing a superb narrative on the American racial divide. The setting is adjacent but mutually suspicious communities in southwestern Michigan. St. Joseph (population 9,300) is mostly white and middle class, while across the narrow river Benton Harbor (13,000) is largely black, poor, and crime-ridden. McGinnis, a black teen from Benton Harbor, vanished one evening in 1991 after fleeing from a man in downtown St. Joseph whose car he'd allegedly broken into. Days later McGinnis turned up in the river. Perhaps he was beaten, but this fleet young man could easily outrace his hefty pursuer. As the author investigates what happened, he finds opinions hardened by race and community bias rather than by the facts (shades of O.J. Simpson). Kotlowitz also finds allegations of police misconduct and biased housing patterns, plus smug indifference by some whites, and certain blacks that cry racism at every turn.Kotlowitz writes about tragedy and race without casting blame or seeking favor. For that reason alone one should read his outstanding narrative. Sadly, the author never discovers how McGinnis died, or the key to healing our racial divide."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This report focuses on a murder in Benton Harbor, Michigan and the differing accounts of its events. It begins with the facts, but goes on to explore how perspectives of the event differ on opposite sides of the river that cuts through the area. Because one side of the river houses a generally white community while the other side consists mostly of African-Americans, the dissent is a starting point for discussing race in America. While the message is very serious, Kotlowitz does build his story through a compelling narrative format."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Alex Kotlowitz wrote a good book that is both easy to read and worth reading. He does a good job at telling the story of the two towns and the towns' residents to a backdrop of a local murder case that tested the towns' race realations. Lots of local history is told in this book. This allows the reader to get closer to understanding the towns. Being from a nearby city myself, I had heard of such conflict it was interesting to read more about the two communities involved (Benton Harbor and St. Joe, Michigan). If your from the area, then this book is definatly woth reading to in terms of getting an outsiders fairly unbiased view of the area. If not, its still worth checking out because its just interesting story to read and may lead to some self-reflection."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The author uses the death of a teenager as a micro-example of racial tension in a midwestern town. What is disturbing is that when reading this book many Americans will see a piece of their America portrayed. Well written and thoroughly reported this made what could have been an academic study of race relations a page turning mystry with a moral."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"We lived in the twin city area (St. Joseph) for 2 years. Being from liberal upstate New York, I was shocked to see the other side of the river. We were told to avoid the mall in the evening and not to drive through the Main strip of Benton Harbor alone, day or night. I don't believe it is segregation by people on either side, I believe it is just the way it has been for a long time. We didn't sense a feeling of hatred on either side, just a totally different way of life. The geographic location of these two cities is absolutely beautiful and to see one in such sad shape is disturbing. I believe the people in each community need to put their heads together and decide how to bring Benton Harbor back to the once beautiful tourist city it used to be. The loss of a child is unfathomable, regardless of the circumstances. It is a shame that a tragedy like this occurred and the blame comes down to a race and location issue!"},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I received my order on time and it was in good shape as expected.

How many times people are oblivious to the obscured differences between towns. How one is predominantly a white race and the other a black race towns. The interesting views of how both groups thought about the outcome of found missing boy's body in the river. The white community stated that the boy fell into the river and that i was a suicide attempt. While the black community stated that it was no accident and no suicide but it was a murder. Reasoning's in why both community had their view is because the blacks didn't go to the white community because of fear. Even though many of the resources are over on that side of town. So you can really see how the view can be one sided. As you read the book you will be revealed to see how one sided the town and legal justice. So i recommend it to anyone who wants to challenge their view and see how racism is still existence."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Stories like these are expected to emanate from large cities not from small coastal towns. As usual Kotlovitz shines proper light on social issues impacting us."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was indeed an intrigue. It was rather easy to read and actually a good supplemental reading for a sociology class. Though slightly biased as he was, Kotlowitz uses the individual example of Eric McGinnis's death to illustrate the unrest and snowball effect that race has on society. The social problems that are results of &quot;killings&quot; (presumed race killings) are of a high magnitude. Although I live in the state where these events occurred (and therefore have my own biases) I believe this to be an accurate portrayal of social unrest due to race relations."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had a hard time following the author's direction. He seemed to skip around a lot and never followed one course for very long. The ending I found really annoying when he started to devote tiny chapters to alternate theories and introduced new people. I think I was hoping more for some type of insight into the race relations between the 2 towns...I was short-changed in that aspect.The reviews of people from St. Joe I find interesting. Mainly because they say the book is inaccurately negative and they don't see that type of discrimination and hostility. I think that if you stepped back into time about 150 years you'd hear the same thing from slave owners. How, it &quot;just isn't that bad&quot;. One of the things I did find most surprising was these attitudes of racism happened in the '90s and are probably still happening. It read more like something out of the '60s. How distressing!It's a story that needs to be told but I didn't like the manner in which it was done.

The only tie he has to our community is that the sister of his sister-in-law, was with one of the main individuals in this book on the night of this unspeakable tragedy. He fails to mention his relationship to this key player at any point in this book.Yes, there is bigotry in St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. But in no way is this book representative of our daily existence. There are questionable areas in St. Joseph, as there are in most cities. I found it odd that Mr. Kotlowitz did not mention having met with anyone from the our Historical Society to obtain unbiased information on the historical prejudices that he says exist in our small towns.I find it unfortunate and am saddened to think that an outsider, who is unfamiliar with the people of our twin cities, will read this book and be left with the most unbelievable impression of two cities, who, so closely situated to one another, can not or will not tolerate the crossing of the river from one town to the next without fear of being harmed."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Alex Kotolwitz it an out spoken liberal, that doesn't know what the heck he is talking out of his butt about.

And may I remind you that this youth did commit a crime he broke in to a teacher of mine son's car.

I found the facts about Benton Harbor's police cars being repoed and how the repair of colapsed main street was handled to say alot about the living conditions in Benton Harbor. It is shocking how the fathers of a city can really mess things up. As far as the death investigation, this is a throughly researched book and by the end you understand why the case has not been solved. The author has a way with describing the embarrassing characteristics of people. The investigation was doomed the moment the body was found. Did anyone else notice that the body was hosed down before the police even arrived. Alot of people are clearly stupid in this country and this book does a great job at shedding light on how their actions can effect an entire community."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was an excellent book about a microcosm of American race relations. My wife has a friend in the Benton Harbor area; that is what got me to read it.

I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because of the following quote on page 111. &quot;Her silver-dollar-size glasses and buttoned-at-the-neck blouse made her look prissy, like a budding librarian.

Otherwise, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"well-written and easy to read, but degenerates into just a series of anecdotes.

In this class we discuss different parts of racial barriers and disscuss how we can make a difference in errasing racial stereotypes. This book, about a death that seperated two towns even more than they already are, reveals many of these racial stereotypes. I think that Alex Kotlowitz did a really great job in presenting both sides to this story. It is hard to write a non-bias story when you have your own views on the situation. I really hope that those who read this book became aware that racial prejudisim is still present in our country. I hope that those who read this book will encourage their friends and loved ones to read it as well so that the eyes of America may be opened everywhere!"},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Alex Kotlowitz deals with heavy issues central to the American consciousness: race, injustice, poverty, inequality. All of these issues appear in microcosm in two Michigan towns -- St. Joseph's, predominantly white, affluent, safe, attractive, and on the &quot;other side of the river,&quot; Benton Harbor, predominantly black, crumbling, drug-infested, crime-ridden. A single event, the disappearance of a Benton Harbor teenager who was later found dead in the St. Joseph River, forced people from both towns to confront problems that had been building for many years.Kotlowitz took great measures to explore the case at length, interviewing many people from each town, analyzing the evidence in police reports, even taking a boat down the river himself to examine the question firsthand. His clear, uncluttered prose style complements his thorough reporting methods.Despite his painstaking investigation, though, Kotlowitz was not able to determine the cause of Eric McGinnis' death, accident or murder. There are no definite answers, he concludes, but the infinite number of possible interpretations reminds us how complicated the issues really are."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It would be a lie to say I can't put it down (I obviously have) but at the same time it is a terribly engrossing book. Mr. Kotlowitz is a graduate of my university, I grew up spending my summers at my grandparent;s house in Lakeside, MI (about half an hour south of the BH/SJ area), and I had heard wonderful things about &quot;there are no children here.&quot; Therefore I was triply interested in this book. I actually bought it as a Christmas present for my father, began reading it on the plane to Michigan and have zipped through it. The beauty of this book it the descriptions of the stark contrasts between lifestyles. These contrasts are what are truly universal and hopefully the reader's eyes will be opened to them. Race relations improve, certainly, but much of (particularly white, upper-middle class America) has been lulled into a false sense of security. The author's descriptions of the towns is insightful and accurate, as is his analysis of events. He seems to fairly judge the motivations of the people involved and present a fascinating as well as heart-breaking case. It is imperative that the reader remember that this work is NON-fiction and that the attitudes and events in Benton Harbor and St. Joe are sadly not limited to Southwest Michigan. They are every town and every community to some extent. I would highly reccommend that if you enjoy Kotlowitz's books, you should read everything you can get your hands on by Jonathan Kozol.

I would recomend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Do not think that because you are not familiar with the communities described in this book, that you will not be able to relate to the story. You can...and you will.As one of the two hundred plus people the author talked to in preparing to write this book, I can tell you that he captured the facts, emotions and personalities with near total accuracy. I lived in the so called Twin Cities during the time these events took place, know many of the people who played roles in the tale, and as a result this book took on much of the affect of a flash back.What is more striking though is that I find that my new community is really not much different. Sure the city is larger, the specific events easily distinguished, the characters are obviously all played by different people, and there isn1t even a river involved. Still, how you perceive an event is likely to be determined by which of two worlds you live in. Here too, this is more true when talking about an event involving race or law enforcement and most true if an event involves both.You will find this book to be an easy read. The characters are vivid (even if there is no pure good and no pure evil). The deaths, particularly of the two young men are disturbing, almost haunting. The events described are both compelling and involving. That they are also entirely true, only makes them more so. The author weaves all this together in a flowing narrative that permits the reader to inhabit two places at once, understanding each, comfortable with neither.While the reading may be easy, the digesting is more difficult. You will find yourself trying to understand why you look at the world the way you do, and wondering how others see it differently. You are likely to be uncomfortable with what you find.But that would seem to be the point.Dan LevyGreater Detroit area(formerly of Benton Harbor/St. Joe)gizmoshouse@voyager.net"},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The story told by Alex Kotlowitz in The Other Side of the River is riveting and somewhat mind numbing. The description of one horrifying story of a teenage male found floating in the St. Joseph River as a basic summary of race relations that could be found across the entire country. The physical separation of two communities is merely 350 feet, but the true distance of separation could not be measured.A young man's corpse is found in the murky substance that draws a line between St. Joseph and Benton Harbor and a true lead about what may have happened does not appear. The lack of competence of investigators and other witnesses seems to make the death nontrivial, the reaction of the community would seem to tell a different story.The underprivileged side of the water wants to pin the blame on the well to do across the way while these individuals believe that the death was not a matter of murder. The story is a synopsis of the existence and relations of the two communities and the different races that call the area home. One calls the other a burden and a negative while the opposition claims it is the affluent Caucasians that destroys the home of the African Americans. Harmony between the two does not and cannot exist. All matters that go on in the communities seemed to be judged by one or the other and blame is placed. Why is a simple difference of color causing the conflict of two potentially extraordinary places? Obviously, the locals do not know the answer to the question and horrible stories as the tale of Eric McGinnis surface and more tension mounts.The tension that exists is much wider than the body of water that lies between the cities. Why tension exists is something that is not understood and may not be anytime in the near future. One question, if no one knows why such insurmountable tension exists, why is it there to begin with? Remember it is only color and a measly 350 feet."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"I have loved every book from Catherine Anderson. This book was no different.

She does not miss her late abusive husband Joseph who drowned as he used scripture to terrorize his wife and daughter; Joseph thought they were temptation sent by Satan. Ironically the rose garden flourishes from a man's touch while the rest of the farm is more wasteland then producer. Her brutal brother-in-law Ryan demands Kate marry him or lose custody of Miranda.Meanwhile, Zachariah McGovern receives a rattlesnake bite while rescuing Miranda from a well. A thankful Kate takes Zachariah home to help heal. Miranda adores her kind, patient hero who plays with her and her ragtag dolls unlike any of the vicious male role models in her life. Zachariah learns why Kate's rose garden blooms and persuades her to marry him to keep Miranda safe from her predatory uncle.This is a reprint of a wonderful 1993 published late nineteenth century romance. The lead couple is a nice paring of wounded warriors although traumatized Miranda owns the storyline as the little innocent child brings out the best (her mom and Zachariah) and the worst (her dad and her uncle) in people. Although the ending seems too stereotypical for these troubled souls, fans will enjoy this Pacific Northwest Gilded Age family drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"Catherine Anderson can't write a bad book.

An agonizing world controlled by a heinous man - a perverted man to whom Kate Blakely had regrettably married. A man unsoundly motivated -- by his own interpretation of the Bible. Joseph Blakely perceived his wife and daughter as \`Handmaidens to Satan' - sent by the evil one to tempt him into sin.Zachariah McGovern is the neighbor around whom Miranda builds a castle of dreams. In Miranda's eyes, this man is her hero. A man who ranks right up there with the fairies, the elves, and the mystical unicorns from her mother's fairytales -- he is the stuff of magical wishes. Zachariah McGovern is a god sent.Through the pages, the author has drawn striking character sketches. Kate Blakely is a gentle, loving woman -- the victim of a life mistake. Anderson drafts Zachariah McGovern from her masculine template - brawny men who are everything wonderful. And little Miranda Blakely is divine, the star of the story. This cast and their lives make remarkable reading material.What are the problems? The conclusion wrapped up too nicely, too methodically. These are two wounded souls who would not come back from the brink of destruction so easily -- no matter who the hero is. Secondly, Zachariah's tragic past was an unnecessary side story. Still, this is a forceful well-written story.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"This is her best work. It's the only book I ever finished, and then immediately reread - the same day. It was also the first I read of Catherine Anderson and what got me hooked on her books. Excellent. So glad to see it back in print. I had to hunt online through used bookshops to find a copy. For me, it's a \\"must have in my collection\\" along with all my Lavyle Spencer collection."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"I'm a Catherine Anderson fan, but she pretty much dropped the ball on this one. Frankly put, it was dull as all hell. I dragged myself through the first 300 pages, then gave up completely. The characters never seemed to evolve past line drawings -- Kate loves her daughter. Zack is very understanding. That's okay characterization for the first fifty pages, but when there isn't much expansion on those themes a hundred pages after that, things start getting stupifying.Anderson has written other books featuring women who were victims of abuse, all of them gracefully handled. I suppose that Kate was her first try at writing a heroine like this, and it took her a while to get it right. She got the maternal love down pat, but Kate was practically an invertibrate when it came to spine or spunk. Zack was a one-note wonder, and there's not much more to say about that. I can't remember the last time that I've been as absolutely bored out of my gourd by two lead characters. They were written as nice and likable, but reading about them became a chore.Save some money and avoid it, unless you need a cure for insomnia."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"Abuse of women and children has been swept under the rug by most people. For those of us who have been abused, we believe we deserved it. Widow Kate and her 4 yr old daughter, Miranda, have been victims of a tormented husband and father until his death. I appreciated how I was able to feel sympathy for him through Kate's eyes, because she understood he couldn't help his behavior, and why he did the things he did. When Zachariah, the neighbor growing grapes to produce \\"sinners' swill\\", rides into their lives looking for his dog (who is digging up the rose garden), he is not welcome. He saves Miranda's life, but nearly dies, and while being nursed by Kate, they form a friendship. He becomes the answer to Miranda's magic wish. I loved the relationship between Zach and Miranda. Breaking through the wall Kate has built to survive her marriage is a challenge. I enjoyed the little bits and pieces of progress. The dead husband is a story in himself, along with his brother. Unfortunately, I kept seeing similarities between these two brothers and a faction of the American public. I call them \\"The Religious Right\\". That certainly doesn't make the rest of us \\"The Wrong\\" by any means, but the Judge's comments to the jury and gallery at Kate's trial about all of them sharing guilt in what happened out at the Blakely place was spot on, in my opinion and is partly responsible for my enjoyment of the book.Catherine Anderson has written a fairy tale for grown ups. There's not a lot of hot steamy sex, but there is plenty of sexualtension and attraction. I especially enjoy the fact that Ms Anderson's female characters are flawed, just like the rest of us. Her women are sometimes overweight, blind, paralyzed, mute, scarred, abused or some other \\"imperfection\\". I like that Zachariah is just as insecure about his appearance as most of us. Although her male heros are always too good to be true, her wonderful stories and characters are likeable, enjoyable, and they always lift my spirits.I just love a good happy ending, and this book lives up to Catherine Anderson's talent for telling a good story."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"Catherine Anderson brings forth a heart-wrenching tale of love, trust and overcoming the most painful odds.Kate Blakey is just trying to piece together her life. After suffering at the hands of her abusive husband for so many years, she is rejoicing in her new found freedom. Life is very difficult for her and her four year old daughter, Miranda after the death of her husband but she is determined to move forward and help her child heal. Just because Kate no longer have to suffer punishment from her deceased husband, she still have to fight off his disturbing brother, Ryan, who believes that Kate should be with him and if she refuses, he will take Miranda away. Not to mention, Kate has to deal with her new ruggedly handsome neighbor, Zach McGovern.Zach wonders what causes Kate and her daughter to become so skittish around them. When little Miranda falls in an old well, Zach risks his life to go in and save her. Bitten by snakes, Kate can't refuse to help the man who has risked it all for her daughter. She helps heal his body and bring him back to life. While Kate works on his body, Zach slowly starts to work on their hearts, showing them that there are some good loving men around.This is a well-written story. Would I necessarily call it a traditional love story? No. My reasons being that there are too many horrific scenes (especially when Kate finally opens up about the abuse she and Miranda suffered from) and the images of what Miranda dealt with stayed with me long after. In all honesty, I end up rooted for the little girl to finally get some peace of mind and a happy ending.The ending wrapped up too neatly and after all they went through it was a little unrealistic. Zach's own side story is interesting but after the painful story it seemed a bit unnecessary to add more heartache to the story.Reviewed by SamanthaThis review was originally posted on The Season site (theseasonforromance dot com)"},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"Couple: Zachariah McGovern and Kate BlakelyKate was married to a very abusive man who beat on her and even tortured their sweet daughter, Miranda, by holding her hands in the fire. Now Joseph is dead and Kate is trying to live her life quietly with her daughter and keep her interfering brother-in-law from taking over her life. Zach is their new neighbor who ends up getting bitten by several rattlesnakes saving Miranda from an old well, and has to recover at Kate's farm. He comes to like Kate and Miranda and realizes they've had an unhappy life with Joseph Blakely. I really like that Miranda warms up to Zach so quickly and even \\"magic wishes\\" him to be her pa. It shows how much she's willing to trust again after the horrible things her father used to do.Kate marries Zach to protect Miranda from her brother-in-law, (who is accusing Kate of killing his brother,) but she's still wary of him. When Miranda disobeys Zach, (by trying to hide in the hay loft when the floor was weak,) and almost has a deadly accident Zach takes her to the house to discipline her. Kate forces herself to trust that Zach isn't like Joseph and wont hurt Miranda. Later when she finds that Miranda only had to sit on a chair in the corner, her trust in Zach is rewarded and they make their marriage real.Miranda is an adorable child. I especially like the part where she's telling Zach about her mother's happy tears and how pretty they make her eyes. She asks if Zach wants to see her happy tears and tells him she just has to tell her mother how much she loves her. I can see why Zach wanted to have her for his little girl.This book's a keeper. It's out of print right now, so I'm glad I was able to get it."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"I have been a Catherine Anderson fan for a long time and she is one of the few authors whose work I will buy as soon as it is published. That written, \\"Coming Up Roses\\" was a good solid read but not excellent, like some of her books. Ones that come to mind arePhantom WaltzandBlue Skies.Anderson has a real knack for coming up with flawed heroes and heroines and this book follows that same formula. It is darker than some of her other books but then spousal/child abuse are dark subjects.I enjoyed this book but found that there were some hard-to-believe and over-the-top moments for me, such as just how many times can someone be bit by rattlesnakes and live? But I read fiction because I choose to and I liked the protagonists in this book, flawed as they are. Kate and Zach and little Miranda are easy to cheer for and Joseph and Ryan, the dastardly villains, are easy to boo.While not my very favorite Anderson novel, this one was still well worth reading."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"This book will touch from the beginning until the end. I have read it several times, and when anyone asks me if I have a book they can read, this is the one I suggest. Hopefully you can find a copy somewhere, I loan mine, but it is a permanent part of my library."},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"Kate & Zach's story is so touching, loving and involved. Kate is a mother who loves her daughter more than life itself. Her daughter, Miranda, will capture your heart. Zach is a strong hard man with a heart of gold. Anderson does her best work here since Keegan's Lady!"},{"Title":"Coming up Roses (Harper Monograms)","review":"I enjoy Catherine Anderson's books and this one didn't disappoint. The fear that the heroine had of her brother-in-law was a little over the top but then back then a female wasn't always listened to. The end of the trial was a little unbelievable and wrapped up a little to pat but overall the book was still enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I reccomend this book. It makes you laugh, and cry. I think that Barbara Park caught the shock of someone getting killed perfectly. This book really makes you think. At parts, Phoebe asks questions, that I never really think of. Questions like,&quot;Who and were is god?&quot;&quot;Where is haven?&quot; and&quot;Is Mick watching us right now?&quot;. Our teacher is reading it to us, and it's sometimes hard not to cry. Phoebe uses God's name in vain, but it's normal. Not to many bad words...but in the beggining, Phoebe calls Mick &quot;A street word that you only hear on HBO and school playgrounds.&quot;. Even though it's sad, this book makes you laugh. You should really read this book."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This is a great book. It talks about the death of a boy from his sister's point of you. It's comical and sad. But most importanly, it teaches you a very important lesson. To wear a bike helmet. Great book, for fun and to learn a lesson."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"My 12 year old daughter insisted that I read this book; I read it one night until midnight, alternating between tears and laughter. A touching, very real family portrait and very very believable."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Mick Harte is the protagonist's brother, who died from a bike accident. Phoebe was the sister of Mick Harte, which is the protagonist. Phoebe and Mick got into fights all the time. They fought over a tattoo of pirates from a cereal box one day. Mick made up a story because Phoebe and Mick wrote F-A-R-T in a wet cemented driveway. Mick said a monkey wrote it and he already chased it back to Africa.Then a terrible thing happened when Phoebe was at soccer practice. She was running and she heard sirens coming her way. She doesn't like sirens at all, they mean bad things happened. Instead she stops running and looks up at the ambulance. The ambulance pulls into the school road and Mick's bike was on the ground and Phoebe realized that Mick probably got hurt. She was hoping it was one of Mick's friends. Then later she found out it was Mick and he died from a head injury. If you like Funny but sad books, here is a great book for those emotions."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"It was good and sad. Mick Harte was 12 years old, and his sister was 13.

I first read the book when I was in the fourth grade and thought that it was a genious novel. In contrast to its size, this book is packed with true, unwavering emotions. The same still holds true today and as I re-read this novel, I felt the emotions on a whole new level. This book may be classified as a children's book, yet if it can still capture the heart of a teenager, it can capture the heart of anyone."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This is a story about a girl who is trying to deal with the sudden death of her brother. The author really captured my attention when sad things happened. For example \\"when Mick turned ten my parents gave this to him for his birthday I tipped the box over and out came a helmet.

It is the book you have been waiting for. Pick it up at your nearest book store."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Mick Harte Was Here by Barbara Parks is a another book I just devoured. It's a story of a 12-year-old girl named Phoebe who just lost her brother when he was in a horrible bike accident. Throughout this book, Phoebe tells the reader about her younger brother Mick and how funny or annoying was. Even though Mick is dead, it's almost as if you really get to know him. All of the truth in Mick Harte Was Here makes it a wonderful sad story.Barbara Parks must have lost a very close person during here life before; it must have been hard for her even though it paid off by making such a wonderful book! Barbara did a fantastic job making the charactors in this book so real. Phoebe goes through all of the stages of a death that any real person would go through. The emotions were written in great detail. There isn't much I disagree with because all of the happenings seemed like it would really happen in that situation.Overall, Barbara Parks' Mick Harte Was Here is a great story that will help the reader better understand the grief of losing a loved one. She made me experience the agony of death right along with Phoebe. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about depessing, yet real struggles."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I cried like a baby.

I highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I think that everybody should read the book Mick Harte Was Here. I really enjoyed the book. It taught me a lot. I learned about things I could do and things that I shouldn't do. The thing that I shouldn't do is don't always be mean to your brother because you never know when he's going to be gone for good. The thing that I should do is always listen to my parents, when they tell me to do something. If I don't wear my helmet while I'm riding my bike, and I fall and die,then my parents are going to be living with guilt all of their lives.Yes, I would tell people my age to read this book because if I learned something from it, then I think that other people will.

It said directly from the book: \\"If only you had ridden Mick's bike home, Mick would still be here. If only his meeting had been scheduled one day earlier or one day later, Mick would still be here. If only the house that he was going to had been in the other direction,\\" and \\"If only the truck had been going a little bit slower or faster, then Mick would still be here.\\"Well, all the time people think of what could have happend or what if. All things happen for a reason. As can be seen, Mick Harte was a very sad book, but I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"The book Mick Harte Was Here is about a girl named Phoebe whose brother,Mick,dies at the age of 12.He dies from a bicycle accident.Wearing a helmet would have saved him.All of her friends tell Phoebe that she's lost Mick.

Mick, who is only 12 years old, dies from a bicycle accident. One sad part is when Mick Harte is killed, and Phoebe talks about Mick's death. At the funeral, Phoebe talks about everything that happened in the past, like when Mick and his mom got in a fight and didn't talk for a while. When Mick dies, that is probably the saddest part in the book. Although this is a sad book, I would recommend that you read it."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"The book Mick Harte Was Here was an all right story. There were a lot of funny parts and a few sad parts. The book tells you about bike safety and how you should be careful on your bike. It has a few funny parts like what the kids write in the wet cement. The book is a good kids' book, and it teaches about death and to be careful on bikes. I thought it was a neat book."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This book is about a girl named Phoebe and her brother, Mick Harte.It all began a day when Phoebe had a soccer practice. That same day, Mick had asked his sister, Phoebe, to ride his bike home.She didn't and in the middle of her soccer practice, Mick had a bicycle accident.When his parents went to the hospital, the doctors told Mick's parents that Mick was dead.Since that day, Phoebe's life has not been the same.I really encourage you to buy the book Mick Harte Was Here.The reason I think you should read it is because it is really cool. The other reason why I think you should read it is because that way you can see what this boy's sister feels about him. There is a lesson to be learned in this book.I really liked it."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"MICK HARTE WAS HERE is an awesome book.It is about a boy named Mick Harte who gets run over by a truck, and his sister ,Phoebe, believed it was her fault. Mick Harte Was Here is also a very funny book. I liked the time were Mick dressed up as Thomas Crapper for Halloween. I also liked the time when Phoebe and Mick were fighting over a tattoo that came out of a cereal box. I really recomend this book, so please read it."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I'm surprised this book hasn't won a Newberry Award! It was not only sad, touching, and even funny, but it had a very good message. Despite a few swear words, I found nothing bad or innappropraite about this book, except that some may be disturbed by it. After reading this book, you'll never want to ride your bike without a helmet again."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This was a really really really good book. It is sad and funny. It is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"When I was a kid I rode my bike all the time. I rode it all around my block and up and down my street. I rode it with my dad and brother to the local high school where we'd play a makeshift game of bike tag. This was all in the 1980s and I have delightful memories of the time. Sure, there was the occasional scare. Once I rode into a street without looking and a car had to stop quite short to avoid hitting me. My dad wasn't too thrilled about that, but nothing bad happened and it wasn't as if I was punished. And not once, NOT ONCE, did I ever wear a bike helmet. At the time, I probably had some vague sense that I was invincible. Today, I look at that near miss with the car and silently shudder. Today kids know about bike helmets and most of them wear them. But there's nothing like a book like, \\"Mick Harte Was Here\\" to kinda drill the point home. I'm not saying that this book is just a good public safety message. I'm saying it tells a compelling story that will probably encourage your kids to take a little more care of their lives than if they hadn't read it in the first place.\\"So this isn't the kind of book where you meet the main character and you get to like him real well and then he dies at the end\\", says narrator Phoebe Harte. Mick Harte is dead, to begin with. In a straightforward voice, thirteen-year-old Pheobe tells of how her brother's death was an accident in the purest sense of the word. He was on his bike, he hit a rock, and he smashed into a passing truck. Instantaneous head wound. Instantaneous death. But before you get to that you get to see a little of Mick on that last day. You see how he messed around with his sister and how they had a mild fight that morning. You get a sense of his sense of humor and wacky style. Without really meaning to, you discover that you really like Mick. And now he's dead. With the barest minimum of text, author Barbara Park shows exactly how one family chooses to deal with Mick's death. Pheobe adjusts better than her parents, but she still has a great deal of difficulty figuring out exactly where Mick is. Fortunately, by the end of the book she's reached a kind of peace. A slow understanding that sometimes this is the way things are. And as a reader, you feel good about that. Sad, but good.Barbara Park's real strength here is the age group she's written this tale for. This is a kind of young reader chapter book, just perfect for fourth and fifth graders. Park's Phoebe has a definite dark sense of humor. For example, after she remarks that the only upside to someone's death is that you have no appetite she points out that she lost some weight just in time for the funeral. Says Phoebe in a bleak comedic voice, \\"Nature's real thoughtful that way\\". \\"Mick Harte Was Here\\", is ultimately hopeful, though. For people who have always associated Miss Park with her pre-eminently popular \\"Junie B. Jones\\" series, they may find themselves a little shocked to realize that Park can be a deeply profound author when she chooses. Death isn't glossed over here. There's a satisfying moment where Phoebe takes on a teacher who keeps talking about the girl's \\"loss\\" and how she's \\"lost\\" a sibling. As Phoebe is quick to point out, no one here is lost. Mick's dead. But by the end of the book, she's come to accept that. And to find a good way to grieve.It's difficult locating well-written books on death for kids in this reading age group. Most of the stuff you're going to find is going to concentrate on dead pets or dying horses and the like. Few writers have the authorial guts to take on the death of a child. Louisa May Alcott did, but she's one of the few. Now Barbara Park has come to join her. This is no \\"Little Women\\", but it's a good read and a true account of how a family must stay together in the time of a crisis. It's not going to answer any questions for kids about death. It'll just tell them how some people deal with it. And that's enough."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This book is MICK HARTE WAS HERE. I want to tell everyone this book is sad and funny. What I like most about Mick is that he dressed as Thomas Crapper for trick-or-treating. Some people don't know about Thomas Crapper. He is the man who invented the toilet. I like the name of the dog Wocket because Mick couldn't pronounce his r's when he was three. The dog's name was supposed to be Rocket.The sad part is that Mick dies. Mick died from a bicycle crash because he didn't wear his helmet. Mick's family was like zombies. They wouldn't even eat in the dinner table because they saw the empty chair and they missed Mick. The dad didn't even iron his pants, and his mom didn't even change clothes. She didn't talk to her daughter, either.At the end of the book Phoebe went to the soccer field to sit there, when she saw a stick. Phoebe thought was a perfect size and small enough to carve the letters into the concrete so they could stay forever. She wrote the letters big enough to see them: MICK HARTE WAS HERE. That was the saddest thing I ever heard, and I want to tell everyone you should wear your helmet, if not, every day there will be deaths. This is a great book for everyone."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I used to read this book monthly when I was younger. It really helped me grasp the concept of mortality in a nonintrusive manner. I recommend this book to mostly the youth, since it is a children's book, but I say let them read it before someone dear to them passes. It was a very important book to me and I feel it can be just as important to those who let it be."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This is one of the most outstanding books dealing with the death of a child (and the family he left behind) that I have ever read! Right from the start, we are told that Mick will die because the narrator (his sister) doesn't want to use his death as a tear-jerker.After that, the book ranges from horrifying to sad to hilarious. (I always laugh out loud when the story of the monkey in the driveway is told -- read it and see if you don't crack up!)Park captures the pain of losing a sibling perfectly without being cloying or portraying the dead child as perfect. The family is REAL: they speak like real people, fight, laugh, cry, love, hurt, and heal like humans... this isn't a paper family"},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"My mom took my sisters and me to the Scholastic Warehouse sale a few years ago. My sister, Rachel, dug this book out of the bargain bin. Although I read it first, I started reading it before bed, and stayed up, reading with a flashlight and bawling my eyes out. Rachel did the same, and Emily, one of our other sisters, who never cries at movies or books, also cried when she read this book. And it's not just because Mick dies, because you find that out in the first chapter, but because of the love you feel from the eloquence of the words Park uses to describe how Pheobe felt about her best friend and brother."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Mick Harte Was Here is a story about a boy who died in a bike accident, as told by his sister Phoebe. The book was funny at times but mostly sad. I liked it because it was funny, especially the part when Phoebe and Mick write the word FART in cement. I would recommend this book for other kids to read, and maybe they will all wear their bicyle helmets when they ride."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Now and then you come along a fantastic book that makes you cry. &quot;Mick Hart was here&quot; is an exellent example of this. It made me glance at my brother and choke back tears. As I can't imagine living for one day without my brother, it must have been encredubly hard for Pheobe as she would wander thoughtlessly into her brother's empty room, untouched since he died, and be so horrified at herself for letting herself go back there. Mick was killed in a terrible bike accident, and i have been in a bad bike accident also, so i felt sort of a special connection to this tear-jerking story. Luckily, i was wearing a helmet, and, while reading this story, i realized how it might have resulted if i hadn't been wearing one. I recommend this book to people that are 4th grade or older, because it's a little intense. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I like the story, Mick Harte Was Here, because it reminds me of my family members and pets that have died. There is one reson why kids as old as 10 and younger shouldn't read the book. It has a cuss word in it; otherwise, it's ok.The story Mick Harte Was Here is about Mick Harte. In the begining of the story, Mick Harte dies. His sister, Phoebe, blames herself for her brother's death."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This is a sad book with a good moral. A lot of kids think it's dorky to wear a helmet, and others think that they're a good enough rider that they don't need one. But have you ever thought that maybe OTHER PEOPLE aren't that great of riders, or drivers? Or maybe you're a good rider, but at a moment you forget to pay attention, hit a rock, and skid into the back of a passing truck. Mick was a funny, happy-go-lucky, full of personality character. It's interesting to hear what happend AFTER he died instead of the author building up your feelings for him and then killing him at the end. His sister and parents are mourning at his death. Everything is messy, and off-schedule. Memories of Mick flow through his sister Phoebe's head as she trys to convince her parents, and herself that they need to move on.There were a few swear words said here and there, and the subject of \\"death\\" may not be good for kids who always love a happy ending, but I think this book should be read by every kid at least once in their life. Not only does it have a good message, but it is an entertaining story that you'll want to re-read."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This book is Mick Harte Was Here.

The doctors said just one inch of Styrofoam would have made a difference between living and dying. Phoebe, his sister told the school what, Mick got every year for his birthday. The first year he got a pink flamingo bowtie and he said he would not ever wear it. The second year he got a trout hat that he again said it made him look stupid. The third year (this year) he got a helmet that was brand new and said it made him look like a dork but that was not funny to anyone this time because that was how Mick died. Phoebe thought it was her fault because that day Mick asked phoebe to ride his bike home. But her and her dad thought of lots of reasons that mick wouldn't have died.Educational: yes because it tells you to wear a bike helmet because it can make a difference between life and death.Entertaining: yes because it makes you wonder what it feels like to be in phoebes shoes."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I have send this before and I will say it again, any book that can makes a whole class of 6th graders, boys and girls cry is a great book.

Get this book today!I loved this book so much. It\`s like you just got into a new grade at school and you don't know anyone. This book hurts because of the sad plot, but it feels good because the characters might have found happiness somewhere. So if you want to know what happened to Mick, read the book NOW! Mick Harte Was Here by Barbara Park teaches you many lessons, but I'm not telling you what they are. The lessons are to be taken seriously!"},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"When I was still in elementary school, I had a wonderful teacher read the entire class this hilarious book called Skinnybones (also by Barbara Park). This book, along with other books that this teacher chose, both introduced me to reading and helped me to love story telling. Barbara Park was always one of my favorite authors when I was a kid, and I don't know if I would have found her books if it weren't for my teacher.As a kid, I felt like Barbara Park understood kids and also knew how to make them laugh (I still have this opinion). Mick Harte Was Here has always been in a very rare category for me. It is one of the only books by this author that I have always wanted to read but that I could never bring myself to read. It has haunted me. I recall a heartbroken kid talking about this book and basically how it totally ripped their heart out; being such an avid reader at the time, I wanted to read it, but the tragedy of the story stopped me.Only now, years later, have I finally gotten around to reading Mick Harte Was Here. I have not cried while reading a book since I was about 10-years-old (the book was A Dog Called Kitty). I found this book to be profoundly moving, and was probably crying about 98% of the story. And if I wasn't crying I was laughing hysterically. If you're not familiar with Barbara Park's stories, she's hilarious. She creates the funniest, most human characters (usually children, but the adults are funny, too). This book is no different.At the beginning of the story, you know that Phoebe's brother has died. She tells you right away, and the entire story is told from her point of view. Her voice is very distinct, and while this book is short (89 pages), it contains so much. It manages to break your heart, make you cry like crazy, make you laugh even more crazily, and introduces you to Mick (in reading about him, I couldn't help but think of my own brother). And this was just a great kid. He was not only just so funny, but also such a realistic character. By the end of the first chapter alone, I already loved him.Not only does Barbara Park manage to completely take your heart in her hand, squeeze like a vice, crush it, and maybe even run over it, but she manages to do so in only an 89-page book. And, not only that, but the characters are also three-dimensional, with flaws, some positive traits, bad habits, you name it - but, again, in an 89-page book. And it doesn't end there: she also manages to make you laugh and cry in the same paragraph. This book is so small, but it accomplishes things books of much greater length never even aspire to. To put it lightly, it's wonderful.There is one curse word and another one that remains unsaid as well as some talk about birth control at the book's beginning, for anyone who wants to know. But, aside from this, it didn't really bother me. It has a good message at the end, that is very powerful and very well done without shoving itself down your throat.This is a great book. It's a very painful read. It's a very funny read. By the end, I felt like I knew Mick, and was mourning him as well. His antics were sweet and hilarious, and you can feel his sister's pain because of his death. I can't say enough about this book. It is the only book I have read in YEARS that has moved me this much. This book has sort of been one of those books I have thought about over the years, and now, I know I'll think about it even more. I won't forget it anytime soon."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Every year, once a year, I read this book. It never gets old. Yes, I am over 12, and yes, I read books that are up to 800 pages every month, but this book is one of those perfect books that you want to hold in your hand all of the time and claim it as your book and nobody else's. This book took me at least two weeks to read when I first read it (which is a little pathetic, but not for a eight year old) and now I can read it in less than an hour. Mick Harte was Here is an amazing tale that gives very important information information to all kids, and is about a girl who lived this life during an accident. It's heart-breaking and each and every time I read the book I wish I could gice the girl and her family a ginormous hug and tell each and every one of them that everything was going to be all right."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I read this book back when I was in 5th grade. I'd seen it sitting on the shelf in my school library for weeks and never picked it up, intent on finishing whatever series I was obsessed with at the time. I finally gave in and checked it out. The only thing I regret is that I didn't read it sooner.As I read, I had to stop and fight back tears at least once a chapter, had to keep myself from thinking about losing one of my brothers like the girl in this book lost hers. By page 81, I was bawling like a baby.Now, 12 years later, I still remember the words on page 81 that make me cry, and using the 'look inside' feature for this book here on amazon, I found out it still reduces me to a bawling, sniveling mess.Those words are: (\\"This is my brother's bike helmet,\\" I said. My voice broke, but somehow I forced myself to finish. \\"He said it made him look like a dork.\\")Whether you're a parent who's looking for a story that teaches your children an important lesson, or someone who's looking for a powerful story that doesn't take weeks to read, this is it. This is a story that I'll take with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"(this is a review my her daughter)I should know..When I was 10 I cried my eyes out at the end of the book...and always put on a helmet on when I rode my bike. Unfortunately I did not do the same on my horse.Long story short..spending hours in karate class as a child saved my life when the horse (Thoroughbred cross) was galloping when she all of a sudden tripped.. Not a bad trip..a mild stumble..but at 30mph and me being bareback with no helmet, only a lead line from a halter to hold on to, I went head first into the hard August earth from over 6 feet up.I don't recall 2 hours after that..Mom saw the whole thing and told me I was \\"home\\" but not answering \\"the door\\". When I started becoming a broken record she knew something was wrong. Plus I vomited when mom and by younger brother brought me through the ER doors.When I finally came to..(fully later that day)The doctor told me he was amazed I as still \\"relatively ok\\". He told me that I was truly lucky to be ALIVE much less still able to walk, talk, ext. I had a nasty concussion and some mild brain bleeding in the left side of my head. My arm was swollen twice its size..this is what happened.......When the horse stumbled (The last thing I remember is a slipping sensation) momentum pulled me off her back to the ground head first...apparently instinctively I turned my head to the left and raised my right arm to protect my head.....had I not done that I might of died or become permanently paralyzed...My arm was even ok just really swollen..(I drink a ton of milk so I have really strong bones).I must of converted 3 or 4 nurses to wearing helmets when they horse back ride when they got a good look at my injures...2 even told me when they left work that day they were going go get some a horse back riding helmet..Now I have a Motorcycle..I wear a full face, fully enclosed helmet!!! Protects me from bugs...and I don't want to have that nasty bump on my head!I only had to stay overnight at the hospital but for 2 weeks after I had \\"sleeping spells\\" at about noon ish and would crash on the couch and sleep for 3 to 4 hours...So no matter what WEAR YOU HELMET!"},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"The book Mick Harte Was Here was very boring.

Phoebe Harte's brother died in a bicycle accident, and now she just has to go back to regular life. The fact that the last time she talked to her brother, they were fighting, haunts her memory. She keeps remembering all the good times and the bad times her and her brother had together, while trying to be strong and not break down. Mick Harte was Here is an inspirational and motivating book that any reader, especially one who has just lost a loved one, would be fond of.Mick Harte was Here is an exquisite book because it is not one of those books where it goes into detail about the main character, and then they die. This book says that Mick was dead from the very beginning. It shows you how Mick was when he was living by the details in the flashbacks. This book is more about how Phoebe grieves over the death of her brother. First she goes into denial, then she accepts it but she acts like life is all good, then she finally cries, and she realizes that her brother has died, and he is gone forever.This book was also very good, because even though it's about a person dealing with a death, it's not all sad. For instance Phoebe talks about when Mick and she was in kindergarten and they wrote F-A-R-T in there newly paved driveway, and how they were so proud of themselves even thought the R was backwards. Phoebe also talks about how Mick would only wear army pants and a shirt with a motorcycle on it to church for three months after he found out that he had to wear a \\"dress\\" in public when he got christened.This book also has a great way of teaching children a lesson, without them even realizing it. Phoebe gets asked to talk to the school about bike safety, and she accepts. During Phoebe's speech she said that Mick got flamingo bowtie from his grandmother but he wouldn't wear it because it made hi look like ma dork, and all the kids in the gym laughed. Then she told them how Mick had gotten a trout shaped hat from his aunt but he never wore it cause it made him look like a dork, again all the kids in the gym laughed. Then she told them that her parents had gotten Mick a bike helmet for his birthday but he didn't wear it because it made him look like a dork, and the gym got silent. Mick got killed in the accident because he wasn't wearing a helmet. That tells kids that it is important to wear there helmets. This book also teaches kids to appreciate what you have, because you never know when it will be taken away from you.Mick Harte was Here is the perfect book for anyone who has lost someone important to them. This book is full of emotion, and is very encouraging. This book does a great job of blending the past with the present, and when you combined that with all the other good features of this book, you will generate a very high-quality book.N.

This book I took emtionally and seriouslly which makes a good book a great one. The only thing I could of done to make this book better was to leave out the swearing.

Soccer, school, guys, and an annoying twin brother named Mick. Phoebe Hart would've given anything, anything at all to get rid of her brother. She would've been willing to trade even her best shirt. That was until the accident. When Mick dies suddenly. Phoebe is unaware of her wish to be rid of him as her world slowly starts to fall apart. Nothing is the same without Mick and even her own mother won't look at her because she shares such a striking resemblance to her brother. Everyone tells Phoebe that it wasn't her fault and that it was meant to be. But Phoebe refuses to accept the idea and searches for no way of comfort. Try8ing to escape and unreasonable guilt, Phoebe becomes tangled in her own dulled feelings and frantically tries to spread the message to all who will listen. To save them from the tragedy in which Mick suffered so horribly. To tell them to be safe, for if only Mick had been wearing a helmet... he would've have been around to bug Phoebe forever."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Mick Harte was here ~ REVIEWBy: Barbara ParkMick Harte is the main character of this book. He is a middle school boy who enjoy's life and breaks rules. His sister is also in middle school. Together they fight and fight and fight. Which is normal for brothers and sisters to do.The alarm goes off and it's time to go to school. Mick and his sis head on to school. They arrive and everything goes fine. The bell rings and school is over. Mick meats up with his sis and tells her that he is riding his bike with his friend to go play when he is supposed to be studying. She covers up for him for awhile. She goes and sits down to talk to her friend for awhile on the field. Just when she hears sirens coming and it pulls into the school parking lot. She freaks and walks over toward the accident. There she sees her brother lying on the ground. He got hit by a car while on his bike. He died from not wearing a helmet.The subject of this book is that if you don't listen then bad things might happen. The main point of this book was WEAR YOUR HELMET WHILE RIDING A BIKE!!!!!! Doing this will prevent people from getting killed like Mike Harte did. The author was just trying to make her point across through this book. It's not hard to slip on a helmet it only take 2 seconds.I do really like this book a lot because not only does it make a point but it's also realistic. This really does happen on the streets. That's why there's safety, the only problem is, is that no one uses safety. That' why this book is good for children and sometimes adults."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Mick Harte Was Here is a story that is about a girl named Phoebe.

Throughout this novel Phobeb tells all about what it feels like to lose someone in your family.I thought that this novel was a good, fun, and enjoyable book to read.

Was until that fateful day that changed the Harte's lives forever-the day Mick Harte died...Phoebe Harte is Mick Harte's sister. She tells a story of the kind of kid everybody liked-a practical joker; a good brother; an OK student. And she tells the story of herself, dealing with the trajedy of her brother's sudden death-her father is an unshaven, no-self-esteem creature, her mother a zombie terrified by her once-loved son, herself angry at her so-called &quot;friends,&quot; and angry at Mick for ruining a perfectly good life. I give it ****, and it has a little of everything in it-sadness, love, humor, and regular fiction. So go ahead and read this sad little book--its worth it."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"Barbara Park is one cool author! She wrote other books, but I haven't read them. I have read one, and that's Mick Harte Was Here. It's very good because there was a boy named Mick Harte. He was funny because he was going to his name his dog Rocket, but he couldn't pronounce his R's so he said, \\"Wocket\\" instead. After Phoebe's soccer practice, she told her little brother to ride his bike home, but Mick really didn't have a choice. Mick rode his bike, didn't see the rock in front of him, hit the rock, flipped over, and then hit his head. After a while Phoebe heard sirens coming towards her direction. Phoebe saw Mick's bike where he had fallen. Then Phoebe heard the dad say in a sad voice, \\"He's gone\\". Phoebe and the dad held hands and walked home acting like if they don't know each other.The parents blamed Phoebe for this mistake. Phoebe tried to apologize for what she had done. The parents didn't listen to her so Phoebe went looking through Mick's room trying to remember him. Actually, one big accident can cause everyone in the family to act weird; everything was going wrong, and they wouldn't eat together until the end. All they would do was stay away from each other, but they all came back together and everything was back to normal in the end, well, kind of.But anyway, I wonder why Barbara Park wrote this story. I think because she had a nephew or someone who died in a bike accident without a bike helmet."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"To start off I would like to say I am speaking from my own experience with this book. It might not apply to everyone.I was 7 years old when my aunt (whom I was very close too) died. My mom (who is a reading teacher) gave me all kind of books to make sense of this terrible event including \\"the giving tree\\" and \\"the fall of freddy the leaf\\". These books were far to abstract for a 7 year old to make the connection between them and their own experiences with death.When I was 10 I read this book in school and it was the first book I can ever remember emotionally connecting too. I understood what it was about because it comes right out and says it. It also shows all the different emotions that follow dealing with death and the process of healing in an obvious way. A lot of children's books want to tip toe around the idea of death (which they should, no one wants to read about it when you haven't experienced it.....talk about a downer).I'm not saying that you should want to read about death but this was a very helpful guide for me in my search for healing as a child. I would recommend it to a parent with an age appropriate child who doesn't quite know how to talk to there child about death."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"A helmet,... that's all it would have took to prevent the death of Mick Harte. Phoebe was at soccer practice when she first heard the ambulance sirens. Automatically she knew that something was wrong. Mick Harte Was Here, is about a boy named Mick Harte and how, his death had such an effect on his family and community. In this book, it really sets in on how important it is to wear a helmet when riding your bike. Even if you think you are too cool to do so. Mick, thought that a helmet would make him look like dork. One day when riding to a friends house, from school, Mick accidentally hit's a rock on the sidewalk causing his bike to get just close enough to the street for... well, disaster.In this book, the authors largest and most important message, was to always wear a helmet while riding your bike. An author's note backs up her message at the end of the book where she gives actual percentages about bicycle accidents. If I were to rate this book, I would give it 5 stars defiantly! It is a fantastic book for families everywhere to read, due to its very important lesson. Another book that I read, and think you will like if this book sounds good to you is Freak The Mighty, which is also a bit sad at the end, but has a good plot and excellent characters."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I think MICK HARTE WAS HERE should get a big 5 stars. I think it is a good book for 4th graders because you will know the sad feeling of the little girl named Phoebe. Her brother is dead because of a bike accident.

Before this book, I didn't know that books could make you feel so much. It really opened my eyes and showed me what a real book is supposed to do. It should resonate with the reader and show why the story is meant to be told. I haven't read it in years, but I still rank it among my favorites.

He read the entire book in 2 days. The fact that the boy in the book died as a result of a bicycle accident that may have been prevented if he had worn a helmet, made a huge impact on him.

She tries to get over it, but inside of her, she still thinks it's her fault.In the book, Phoebe's best friend is this girl named Zoe. Phoebe shares her pain about Mick's death with her. During the book, Phoebe talks about her life when her brother Mick was alive. When Mick died, everyone was sad : Mick's parents, Zoe, and Phoebe. However, Phoebe didn't like feeling sad; she also didn't like people feeling sorry for her.Around the end of the book, Phoebe starts to express her feelings and kind of starts to get use to the fact that Mick is dead, and it is no one's fault that Mick is dead.

Mick and his siter, Phoebe, were like twins, only Phoebe was 10 months older than he was. The book begins with an ordinary day. Mick came running down the stairs while Phoebe was sitting down and opening the cereal. Phoebe \\"called\\" the tattoo which was in the cereal box. They both wanted it, so they fought over it. That morning then they went to school. After school, Mick wanted Phobe to walk his bike home, but she did not want to so she just told Mick, \\"NO.\\" She was sitting on the soccer field watching a game when she heard sirens. She wanted them to turn off, so she was saying in her head, \\"Turn off, stupid thing.\\" They did, and the coach walked up to her and said, \\"Phoebe, it is Mick.\\" Phoebe was freaking out. She ran over to where Mick was. She felt so bad. She was crying. Then she got into the car with Zoe,and they took her home. Her mom and dad were crying for weeks. Mick said when he died he wanted to be creamated, so he was, and Phobe put his ashes evrywhere. When the time came for his funeral, Phobe went to the mike and showed everyone a card Mick made his mom for Valentine,s Day. When her grandmal came up from Florida they had a dinner and they did not even look at Mick,s chair. The book is both funny and sad."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This book is called Mick Harte Was Here. I really liked this book because I learned that a helmet is very important. If you don't use a helmet when you are riding a bike, then you probably could get a head injury. This book is mostly about a boy who dies of a head injury because he was riding his bike without a helmet. That is what caused the head injury. You could really learn about this book if you read it.Mick was going really fast on his bike and then hit a passing truck. The cause of hitting the passing truck was that Mick's wheel hit a rock, and Mick flipped over.This book reminds me of my brother and me because we always get into arguments. He doesn't want to put his helmet on. That is what happened in the story. Phoebe and Mick always got into arguments because they both always wanted the tattoos that came in the cereal boxes. Just like my brother and I, Phoebe never argued with Mick so he could put his helmet on.I recommend everybody to read this book. It is a really good book."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"I think that MICK HART WAS HERE is a sophisticated book for children of all ages and all grades. When Mick died, Phoebe, Mick's sister, was in a stage called grief, which means suffering. And the best way to get over grief is to talk about it, because when the family talks about it, they talk and they remember Mick. For example, they talked about how he acted on Halloween when he was dressed as Thomas Crapper. Thomas Crapper is the inventor of toilets.Phoebe and Mick had a fight on that tragic day, and the mom did not tell Mick to wear his helmet and he died from a head injury. And now that Mick is dead, everybody is going through a tough time. The dad does not want to remember Mick, but Phoebe wants to remember what funny things that he did every day till the day he died. For example, that time he smacked the salad with his flyswatter because he despised flies because they throw up all over your food and suck it back up (Yes). I know that it is gross but that is what they do. For another example, he spelled FART in the concrete.In conclusion, I think that MICK HEART WAS HERE is the best book for kids of all ages because it encourages kids to wear helmets when they ride their bikes."},{"Title":"Mick Harte Was Here","review":"This book is called Mick Harte Was Here.

Zoe, Phoebe's friend, was talking about her problems. After that Phoebe and her mom started talking to each other. The family started talking and eating together at the dinner table. They started living like they used to but a little bit weird.I like this story because it reminds me that my brother and sister are kind of crazy and silly. They really get mad because I'm their older sister. My brother and sister did not die, but they drive me crazy. Anyways, I thought this story was really funny, sad, and kind of stupid. I thought it was kind of stupid because there are some things like on Halloween he dressed like Thomas Crapper, the man who invented the toilet. Another year he even dressed like Henry VIII and another year he dressed like Clarence Birdseye, the father of the frozen food industry. The other stupid stuff that he did was getting an autograph from a man dressed like a bird.Well, find out the rest. Read it.

It was one of those kind of books were you can't put it down. I admit, it was a very easy read. I would recommend this book to someone who likes any kind of fiction, it would be liked by any type of reader. It is about the day a kid, an average kid who everyone would like, dies in a bicycle crash and is also about the effects on the whole Harte family after this tragedy. The reason he died, is do to a massive head injury, which would have been prevented if only he wore his bicycle helmet, but Mick thought he looked like a dork in one. This book is told by Phoebe, Mick's sister, who was most effected by his death because not only was Mick her brother, but her best friend. She tells her every emotion, and tell about what it was like at school. Mick's parents also are very much effected, his dad goes unshaven and dirty, his mom just sits around in her pajamas all day doing nothing, and they are full of grief. Phoebe can't stop talking about Mick, driving her mother crazy and making her cry every time his name is said.

The authors discuss various symptoms and when you should be concerned that it might be something serious. This includes answering the very important question &quot;When do you try to treat it yourself and when do you call a doctor?&quot;After this groundwork is laid and you and your doctor have determined that your back pain is nothing serious, the authors delve into a detailed program for alleviating your pain. The first part details an exercise program and how exercise helps resolve back problems. The appendix includes detailed stretching and other exercises. Of course exercise is only part of the treatment plan, it also requires a healthy eating program. Because excess weight can contribute to back pain losing weight and correcting unhealthy eating habits is part of a total approach. This section also includes various dietary changes that keep bones strong, connective tissues healthy, and other health issues that can affect back pain in check.In the interest of being thorough it also includes complementary and alternative medicine techniques that may help. These include herbals, balms, back to basics of sitting, lifting, lying, and other normal activities, music therapy, biofeedback, massage, Rolfing, Pilates, chiropractic, osteopathy, acupuncture, and even surgery.Of course all this advice is not of much help if you don't provide the details of how to get there. So, the appendixes contain many recipes, exercises, references, and supporting information. If you have a back pain problem &quot;The Pain-Free Back&quot; is a recommended read and an excellent resource to become informed about your treatment options."},{"Title":"The Pain-Free Back : 6 Simple Steps to End Pain and Reclaim Your Active Life","review":"I read this book to get ideas on how to stop back pain. While I'm not a proponent of natural or complementary therapies, these doctors convinced me that taking control of my lifestyle habits was the only way to end the pain. I even went as far as to start taking the natural dietary supplements glucosamine and SAM-e (recommended in the book). Other anti-inflammatory medications had caused a horrible stomach condition, and the natural supplements ease the pain and have allowed me to be more active and start walking again with my wife and kids. The review of causes of back pain was most helpful, and I began to question whether my primary care doctor had really diagnosed my pain correctly. A consultation with a rheumatologist confirmed that I had a form of arthritis common to men instead of pulled muscles. This book urged me to seek answers and reclaim an active life. Thank you. I must add that this book is not hype or sham. I'm cautious of books such as that. This book is highly credible by two renowned doctors and experts in their respective fields. I'm now getting the Pain-Free Arthritis book they wrote for more information on my back condition. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Pain-Free Back : 6 Simple Steps to End Pain and Reclaim Your Active Life","review":"A most enjoyable and helpful read.

I scanned through the book and found that the step-by-step multifaceted program focused on my lifestyle habits. From exercise to diet to stress management, the authors explain how these habits influence back pain--either decreasing or worsening it. I found the step on computers and back pain most helpful, as I am a newspaper editor and get horrific pain after a long day of work. The suggestions on how to sit, lift, stand, and work at a computer were insightful. I recommend this book to men and women who suffer with back pain and--no, it's not in your head.

I've suffered with back pain since young adult years after a car accident. While I still work and do most of the things I enjoy, I always have a nagging pain in my lower back. I've tried chiropractors but none helped me. My doctor had me on several medications for pain which left me feeling groggy and all I wanted to do was sleep! This book touches on a variety of self-care steps you can take to end that nagging pain. I started with Step 1 - exercise - and was hesitant for fear it would aggravate my pain. I was pleasantly surprised!! After just one week, my pain lessened. So--I exercised more--and the pain now is barely there. I especially enjoyed the wake-up call the authors gave in Step 2 - The Pain-Free Diet. I didn't realize that just 10 pounds over a healthy weight can create so much havoc with the body!! I've been on the recommended low-carb diet and have dropped 8 of those pounds--again, contributing to the reduction in pain. The steps on alternative therapies, stress reduction, and touch therapies were incredible. I believe that we are the master of our pain--if only we know the tools to help end it!

Upon finishing it, I regretted reading it. This esteemed author reveals a bit too much about her extremely right-wing politics, her puzzling infatuation with rank and privilege, and her obsessive nature. I didn't count the number of speeches and signings she did in her 78th year, but the number would be staggering. She seems unable to refuse any request to be honored and fawned over. Of course, her obsessive nature is useful in crime fiction, I suppose. And her prose remains the model of clarity. I still love her work and will go on reading it, but I will have to make an effort to separate my negative impression of the woman."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I'm a big fan of P. D. James's mystery novels, so I looked forward to getting to know her better in this book. I guess fame has ruined her. She comes across as opinionated and self-righteous, and drops names to impress us. She's not a person I'd want to sit next to on a train."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"It has taken me over a year to fully appreciate this &quot;fragment of autobiography&quot;. There are no strict rules for autobiography writers to follow, except that they talk about the themselves. P.D. James, the acclaimed British mystery writer, does that in her own, 'Time To Be In Earnest', and the reading experience is one which leaves a definite impression.At first read-through, the book leaves one with a slight sense of having been cheated. Most celebrity autobiographies written in today's age wallow in over-exposure. We get to know what goes on in their minds, their businesses, their homes, even their bedrooms. Even when the subject is dead, and a *biography* is written, the author attempts to portray the person as emotionally as possible. With 'Time To Be In Earnest', Ms. James does not make us suffer through any of that. Her life story is told in a charming &quot;daily (sometimes) journal&quot;, which reflects on the news of the day, and then nicely segues into memories of her past.We get to know much about P.D. James's childhood, her parents, siblings, home-life, etc. She is purposefully vague about her marriage, but she *does* provide sufficient information about it that we get the idea. That is what is so elegant about her book - it is informative, without being messy. What I found *most* fascinating were her views on the world of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Some things I agreed with her on, some things I did not. But all of her 77 year-old ideas gave this particular 25 year-old much to think upon.'Time To Be In Earnest' truly tracks the 77 years of not only a highly-successful British woman's life, but of the country itself, and of the world that has come, gone, and is here today. ."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"Time to Be in Earnest is a journal kept by mystery writer P.D. James beginning in 1997 and ending in late 1998. She does not confine herself just to events during these dates, instead recaling her life earlier. She writes of starting to write because she did not want to be a grandmother who said &quot;I wanted to write a novel&quot;, the England she remembers after World War 1 and surviving World War ll. She recalls old friends, literary influences, historic events, infamous crimes of the British Isles. Also touched upon is the struggle of living with a husband with chrinic mental illness and the acceptance of being the support of her family. All this is conveyed in some of the most flowing and beautiful language I have ever read. The everyday is lifted up by the command of the English language and the observant eye of someone embracing life. A wonderful book, a joy to read."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"As an avid fan of PD James's pyschological thrillers, I was looking forward to a good read from her &quot;fragment of autobiography&quot;. Ms James wrote a memoir for one year - the year of her 77th birthday. It is both a daily diary and a reflection of the past - both personal and historic and has commentary on her writing and books. I found it mostly interesting, but at times very dry. Perhaps we are conditioned to expect too much in the way of personal anguish to be satisfied with bare bones, but I felt that was what we were mostly given. I would recommend it for Ms James'fans, but perhaps not more widely."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"It's wonderful to read this autobiography and learn what the Baroness P.D. James does from day to day over the relatively short period covered in this work. It's intelligent and witty and full of great photos of family and friends--there is one particularly nice shot of Miss James and Ruth Rendell. After reading all her great mysteries, it was a pleasure to read how she puts her books together and weaves the rest of her life around her work. Easily worth five stars! Thanks...."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"Reading this thoughtful and immensely readable book, appropriately subtitled &quot;a fragment of autobiography&quot;, is like a personal invitation to a friendly, but never cozy, English cream tea prepared specially by the author. One comes away captivated by her honesty, humility, intelligence and wit, touched by her courage and fortitude in the face of troubles and sorrows, cheered by her masterful writing, grateful for her keen discretion in choosing to exclude the more sensitive areas of her private life (an uncommon but wise option in this &quot;confessional&quot; age), and finally, satisfied but never satiated by the delicious repast. Thanks for the memories, P.D. James!"},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"In addition to being one of the best contemporary mystery writers, P.D. James has an extraordinary command of the English language. Her book, a combination diary of her 77th year and a reflective looking back, is a must read for her fans. Some parts relating to her personal life, such as having a baby while bombs were being dropped during World War II and her relationship with her cat Polly-Hodge, make for interesting reading. Other parts about the more technical aspects of book writing and publishing, with the exception of her comments about adapting her books into TV movies, tend to be dry and would hold more appeal to writers and those in the publishing business."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"After an uneven beginning, Time to Be In Earnest, settles down to an earnest and enjoyable memoir (it is in diary form, covering a year: 1997-1998).P.D. James has a distinct voice, comprised of dignity, reserve, confidence, practicality and intelligence. This voice or persona flows throughout the book. Not a reader of P.D. James' mystery novels, I have no way of knowing if this voice appears in her fiction. It is not a quiescent voice and therefore, not lightly ignored. It does give the reader an image of the author's personality, an image that may or may not be accurate.P.D. James has an eye for detail, a quality that can bog down many a memoir and almost does in this case. However, there is something lesiurely, even unaggressive, about the wealth of detail, and it is intermingled with reflections on religion, nature, life, entertainment, writing and much more. And if you enjoy well-written pictures of nature, the prose of P.D. James will certainly delight and satisfy.In fact, there's a bit of everything in this autobiography for everyone. I found the comments about writing and true life detective cases most interesting as well as P.D. James' experiences in WWII. There are references to Chatsworth, the House of Lords, the BBC and more prosaically, P.D. James' cat, the Civil Service and the work on her house.There is always the suspicion in reading autobiography that it will be like watching other people's home movies: just a tad deary and confusing. This is not the case of Time to Be In Earnest. The smoothness of the writing carries the reader past all unknown faces (and it's fun to &quot;meet&quot; the few known ones). One gets the experience of the author's life as it happens. Many--if not most--memoirs/autobiographies are the analysis of events after they have been lived. This is true of sections of Time to Be In Earnest as well (and the analysis is always interesting) but the process of living alongside someone is what sets this book apart.It is not a book to rush through. Read it a bit at a time and catch the very English flavor of a very English lady."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"One reviewer said of this book, &quot;. . . parts about the more technical aspects of book writing and publishing . . . tend to be dry and would hold more appeal to writers and those in the publishing business.&quot; These were the parts I liked best, and I'm not a writer. But I am a reader, and I've read and enjoyed most of P. D. James's books and the other books she discusses.James kept a diary during the year she was seventy-seven. She records what's happening in the present and reflects on aspects of her past. In the present, James is constantly traveling, giving talks, and spending time with friends old and new. She appears to be a very busy person. All this traveling about, though not exactly boring, is not exactly fascinating either. To me, the more interesting parts were about the past and especially her thoughts and opinions on other writers, mainly mystery writers. Ms. James is another big fan of Jane Austen's, and an appendix gives the text of a talk she gave to the Jane Austen Society on mystery in EMMA.Ms. James's outlook on life is that most things were better in the past (with the big exception of sanitary protection). She appreciates her relatively good health and independence and is grateful for each day, storing up good memories to sustain her as she grows older.James is too refined to speak ill of anyone and is unwilling to reveal personal details about her life with a mentally ill spouse. She is quite willing to share her opinions on public issues, but she's reluctant to give us the inner P. D. James.Still, I was more interested in this book than the other one I was reading at the same time, V. S. Naipaul's A HOUSE FOR MR BISWAS.If you're a mystery fan, you'll probably enjoy James's remarks about other mystery writers of the past."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P.D. James has given her readers a rare glimpse into her thinking. I saw the daily events as ways to connect with what she wanted to say about her beliefs and about her very interesting and productive life. I have read all of her books and was pleased to be able to understand the author behind the mysteries which she so skillfully writes. I also enjoyed her glimpse into a world which is fading fast - a world where character was important and manners counted for a lot.Elizabeth Skoglund author of Divine Recycling: Living Above Your Circumstances"},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"What a marvellous book P.D. James has written!It is not just for fans of her mysteries. Rather, it is for anyone who has had to have a day job to pursue other interests, who has toiled in hospitals or government bureaucracies, who had to deal with family problems--all of which P.D. James had to do. Luckily, the book, like her life, has a happy ending, with a seat in the House of Lords, a place on the BBC Board of Governors, and visits to the Queen's Garden Party, in addition to best-sellerdom and homes in Oxford and London, to top it off! It is so charming that after reading it, I gave it to my mother to celebrate her 77th birthday (P.D. James' gave this milestone as the reason she wrote the book -- at 77 it is time to be in earnest)."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"Strange as it is, I read James' fragment of an autobiography before I read any of her fiction. My father had met her aboard an ocean liner and as they got to know one another, James recommended that he give me a copy of Time to Be In Earnest. I enjoyed it because it gave me ideas of how an autobiography might be shaped, should I ever want to write one myself. The approach James took, that of keeping a diary that then led her when appropriate to comment on past events of her life, was interesting and made perfect sense. I did enjoy reading about the daily activities of such a famous personage, the meals out, the talks given, the places visited. I appreciated how her approach to autobiography allowed her complete control over what she chose to share and what she chose to keep private. Her musings on the art of fiction were also thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P.D. James, the renowned crime novelist, has given us a fragment in the life, &quot;a year that otherwise might be lost not only to children...but with the onset of the dreaded Alzheimer's, lost also to me&quot; (the author). This engaging but all too brief memoir tells of the author's moving experiences (parent's unhappy marriage, a husband doctor returning insane after WWII, etc.) paired with the author's uplifting experiences (career in the Police and Criminal Law Department which explains her detailed knowledge of forensics as shown in her fiction, children and grandchildren, etc.). The current that runs beneath these experiences is her moral philosophy - her belief in the power of traditional institutions and a powerful explanation of her fascination with murder and violence. Indeed, a rewarding experience, especially for avid readers of James' novels."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P. D. James is the only mystery novelist of whom I've read the entire oeuvre, apart from Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie, and I don't really know why. A sense of obligation to the reigning British Queen of Crime? Appealing length and density? Although I do remember one excellent book, Original Sin, it is perhaps not surprising I found this &quot;fragment of a biography&quot; more entertaining than her novels, since a lot of what she terms &quot;character buildup&quot; and &quot;scene setting&quot; always seems to me a terrible drag on the narration. As a personal diary, it is too organized - no wonder, since it was intended for publication from the start - and there are no spontaneous bursts of emotion or painful self-examination that is so exhilarating in Sylvia Plath's journals. With James it is all carefully laid out, a prosaic entry too often expanding into an essay on government, the art of the crime novel, civil justice, etc. But still, the writings betray a highly intellectual mind at work, and a winning perseverance that has triumphed over pain and hardship."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I've enjoyed all of P. D. James' fiction works, but found the fragment of autobiography interesting, but a bit tedious. The book is interesting in that her life is filled with drama, trials, and turmoil; tedious in the multiple social and literary events that are recited. I can only surmise that the author herself really was not interested in keeping the diary and found it tiresome."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"Highly recommend seller. Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Would definitely buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I've been intrigued by P.D James since I read her very first novel and have always wanted to know her better as a person. A Time to Be in Earnest provided a tantalizing look at a long and productive lifetime of a woman who encountered more than her share of challenges and dealt with them with courage and resourcefulness.While not everyone will appreciate the diary form of this autobiography, I found it to be just as unique and thought-provoking as James' fiction - and James herself. I also appreciated her thoughts about the very personal nature of memoirs in general. It's important to remember that a personal memoir is just that: personal. It reflects the writer's unique perspectives and worldview.I would recommend A Time to Be in Earnest to any fan of PD James!"},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I found this book to be exceedingly booring. I felt like I was reading someones facebook. I was unable to finish the book."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P D James is always inspirational, writing not only about crime but about human beings in all their complexity and painting captivating scenarios which keep us alert to the world around us at the same time as they comfort us for the horror of which we are daily made more and more aware of. Her personal memories are as earnestly inspiring as her fiction."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P.D. James has long been one of my favourite authors. Her cast of characters are second to none and her descriptive writing passages should be studied by all aspiring writers. She is the full package. Even her age has not slowed her down, or made her less of a writer. When I saw she had written an autobiography I was only too happy to download it.Written in 1997, the year P.D. James turned 77, \\"Time to be Earnest\\" is her quest to be an adult. She writes not just of current events, but of her past. She recounts events of her school days, of the war and living with her husband as he deals with mental illness. She writes candidly, but without looking for pity at being a single parent.This book, written in her indomitable style is a wonderful insight into what makes P.D. James tick. She is a true lady, and her strength of character shines through every page of her diary."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I have loved P.D. James mysteries for years and looked forward to getting a glimpse of the author herself. While the book is extremely well-written, as her books invariably are, I found it somewhat disappointing. I found it to be, more than anything, a rather uninteresting description of daily events in 1997 -- luncheons or dinner parties she attended, speaking engagements, conversations with friends and so forth. In addition, I was slightly put off by what seemed to me to be a rather stuffy and self-satisfied tone to the book. I look forward to her next effort -- fiction only, please."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"As an avid P.D. James fan, I had no idea what to expect from her autobiography. I found myself intrigued by the style and substance of her writings; she is a brilliant writer and thinker. I turned the pages of this book compulsively--feeling a wide range of emotions from amusement(she has a wonderful sense of humor) to sadness.(her musings on old age and death are very profound and poignant) Thank you P.D. James for writing a classic in the autobiographical genre."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"As a fan of P.D. James' mysteries, reading her 'fragment of autobiography' served as an interesting chance to get to know the woman behind the words. \\"A Time To Be In Earnest\\" is a diary written for one year of the author's life: since the original intent was publication, there is a formality to it and it does lack the spontaneity of emotions of other diaries. Yet that does not diminish what is written within its pages, for it is a glimpse into the everyday life of a woman, a writer, a grandmother, a public image, etc... as she reflects on the past, present, and what the future may bring.P.D. James did not begin writing her novels until she was in her thirties - she was already married with two daughters and worked as a public servant. Her diary begins with a note to the reader about the task ahead. The title is taken from a quote by Samuel Johnson that reads, \\"At seventy-seven it is time to be in earnest\\" and so during her seventy-seventh year, James keeps this diary as a way to ward off the would-be writers of biographies and to help her remember certain events and moments in the face of oncoming age. Sometimes her entries focus on her early life, giving readers a brief biographical sketch of home and school, while other entries are forays into James' thoughts on current affairs, past crimes, and what it is like to be an author in demand. Also during this year, readers follow the author as she promotes her newly published book (\\"A Certain Justice\\") and travels throughout the world, allowing readers to into her insights on the places she visits.There is no doubt that P.D. James has led an extraordinary life, having experienced love, loss, and the shattering and numbing consequences of war. Her diary is, at times, like sitting down with an old friend (who happens to be a favorite author) and discussing books, history and the affairs of the day. Readers are drawn into her life, just as they are drawn into the characters she creates in her fiction. (An included positive for Jane Austen fans, is a talk that James gave on \\"Emma\\" and how it is a detective story, with James laying out the clues that Austen left for readers to find.) James may fancy herself a grandmother who happens to write detective stories, but I for one am glad that she continues to write, well into her eighties."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I was amazed by all the positions which P.D. James has held, at her bravery and persistance in handling family problems and becoming a writer. Even now, when she might just enjoy her peaceful home, she doesn't seem to ever decline exhausting promotion tours (I attended her lecture in Phoenix, and she looked so tired)and she is involved in so many boards, etc. If you love her books, you will appreciate her revealing how she got her ideas for each one. This is a book to dip into, and it can get a bit repetitious (she always stops to smell the flowers, AND describe them). I was especially interested in the true cases of murder and how she wove them into her novels."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"This has to be one of the most unique autobiographies I've ever read. The premise is brilliant. P.D. James takes one year of her life, at age 77, and as we follow her from activity to relative to meeting to book event, she also takes the time to reflect on the larger picture of her life and the people she has known for most of her life, providing historical details as a stream of conscious memory. Some of her life just isn't that interesting, but trying to manage two children and a marriage to a man who spent most of his adult life in asylums, as well as being made a Peeress of the Realm, and all of the publication minutae are pretty interesting. It is always fun to read the story of a life richly lived by an accomplished person."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I found this book in my library yesterday and have read it almost non-stop.It is truly delightful. I like the understated way she weaves her life story. What impressed me most is her down to earth way of saying that she realized that she would have to support her family since her husband was unable to. She just did it without whining or expecting anyone to help her. Her ideas and opinions on the health care system are right on target.Her references to other works, both hers and other authors, will keep me busy for a long time. I want to check out all of them.What I envy most is her mention of going here and there to conferences and book signings, etc on the great train system in England. I have spent some time there and know how convenient it is. Wish we had such a rail system in the U.S.Her thoughts on the writing experience are also informative. Am so glad she has written this book."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"Fans of James' mysteries will relish this autobiography: a personal memoir which takes the form of a diary of a single year of her life. From reflections on her writing career and topics to the evolution of her style and opinions on modern times, this provides readers and prior fans with an intriguing glimpse into her personal life.Diane C. Donovan"},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P.D.James writes wonderful novels, but this autobiographical sketch of one year in her life is not her best. The year she has chosen to relive for us, 1997, seems to be one continuous round of speaking engagements interspersed with frequently stuffy opinions on English political and social issues. Her discussions of writing and writers were of the most interest to me and I wish she had spent more time talking about her own writing and research.Her opinions of the House of Lords were a bit self-serving. Back to Adam Dalgleish, I say!"},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"I've never read a P.D. James book before; I've only seen the adaptions on TV of her Adam Dalgliesh mysteries, however since reading this fragment of autobiography I am a new and loyal fan of her writing. This book takes one year of Ms. James's life and lets us in to know her points of view, her dislikes, insights into how she writes and what she thinks are the key elements for creating a detective story, along with the busiest schedule I've ever seen for a 77 year old (although she is now 89 and still writing bestsellers).Ms. James's love of Victoriana and all things connected with that era comes through both in her writing and speech but also in her thoughts on the world. As a fellow fan of this era I immediately knew I'd found an inspirational and wonderful writer from whom I can glean a better look into the human psyche through her insightful words and observations. During the writing of this book, Ms. James was promoting her newest novel at the time, \\"A Certain Justice\\". This is where I have started in reading her works and as a gentle warning, once you pick them up, they are very hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"Samuel Johnson famously said that 'at 77 it is time to be in earnest' and P.D. James is. She has not been a diarist but for this book she forced herself to become one. The book consists of a year's worth of diary with flashbacks and memories of the past. Structuring an autobiography is far more difficult and far more problematic than it may at first appear. Her solution here is certainly novel. Superficially, the book is an account of a year's events--speeches, book tours, lunches, and so on, but ultimately it explores the key events and key individuals of her life, with all the tears and joys attached. She evokes a vivid sense of the war and what it was like to bear and protect infants then; she speaks of her beloved husband's struggles with mental illness, the fact that she was forced to support the family and do so by wending her way through a government career after taking what Americans would think of as a continuing ed program at the City University in London. She is so literate, so polished, and so well educated that it is hard to believe that she lacks a formal college education. Her success as a writer came relatively 'easily', though that is always a relative term. It came early, but it did not come without great labor.Time to Be in Earnest includes wonderful reflections on the craft of writing and the specific culture of crime writing and interesting anecdotes about such household names as Ruth Rendell and Iris Murdoch. Phyllis James/Baroness James knows everyone and speaks of them honestly and in detail. She also tells us about her cat (named for Johnson's cat, Hodge), which I found more interesting than I expected. I loved her comments on modern culture--on travel, on cell phones, on education, on political correctness, political personages (including the Blairs) and such unexpected pleasures as an account of what it is like to spend the night at Chatsworth. In all of these matters she is scrupulously honest and scrupulously frank. The impact on her of Johnson and of the Jane Austen of the letters as well as the novels is clear.This is a delightful book and you do not need to be a fan of P.D. James's crime fiction (she would say detective fiction) to enjoy it. It is a very English book in every way, but it is also pure Horatio Alger--relatively poor woman hungry for butter during the war becomes Baroness James of Holland Park and doesn't change a great deal in the process. I had the great pleasure of meeting her once and talking to her for a few minutes. She is absolutely the genuine article--kind, direct, real with a capital R and authentic with a capital A. The book conveys that, without any arrogance and without any pretense. Read it and love her."},{"Title":"Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography","review":"P.D. James fascinates me. She writes mysteries containing biblical allusions, phrases from the Book of Common Prayer and broad cultural references. Reading one of her novels, I am bound to learn ten new words, several new authors, poets, works of art, music or architecture.She calls her memoir a fragment of autobiography. I was eager to learn more about a lady who, in a catalog of people I admire, reminds me of David McCullough. Decent. Dignified. Distinguished.Time to Be in Earnest is written in the format of a diary of Baroness James' seventy-seventh year. Notes of her daily life show her to be full of humor, humility, generosity and humanity. And busy! She includes time with her family and friends, memories of her childhood, and a potpourri of opinions. P.D. James is interested in life; hence a journal of her daily life is interesting.The appendix contains the full talk P.D. James gave to the Jane Austen society on 18 July, 1998. Austen fans will love it!"},{"Title":"Karma","review":"I wasn't sure that I could finish this book after I had read the first half. It seemed disjointed, with no real detail but a bunch of actions thrown together. Each action was meant to catch the attention, and did mine. However, the transition from action to action reminded me of the camera work on NYPD Blue. This may work on TV, but in a book it almost makes you wish you could get seasick.On the other hand, the last half of the book seemed to come together and flow better. In any case, it would make a better movie than a book.

You'll see what I mean if you read the 3 scenes where there's gunplay in Colt Creek\\" Then read the scene in Karma where Evan fights the Pathan fighter who does the killing for the Rao Family. They're both equally brilliant.Does anyone know when Smith's next novel will come out? It's about a beautiful woman who is a circus performr.

Suderow"},{"Title":"Karma","review":"When this book surfaced about eight years ago, I remember all the critical kudos and recommendations it got. For some reason, even though I had the book shortly thereafter, I never got around to reading it until now.This book has some exceptionally well written scenes; vignettes that touch the heart and make for some truly memorable moments. For instance, the hero (?), Evan Scott, needs to buy ammunition so he goes to an old childhood friend whom he has neglected since becoming a well established architect. Their scene of what friendship can truly mean is really heartfelt. Later, Evan,along with his unsolicited sidekick, Dass, are walking through Central Park and the elderly man suddenly reaches out and takes Evan's hand to hold and walk. Although initially embarrassed, Evan lets him do that and they walk hand in hand, like a father and son walking along the beach. It's moments like these that elevate this somewhat ineffective thriller to its heights. Unfortunately, a series of touching vignettes and some suspenseful action scenes, do not a great novel make. The plot focuses on Scott's efforts to stop a Hindu (that's right) mob from killing people who know about their secrets at a construction site. A girl falls from the building, Scott catches her eyes on the way down, and from then on, Evan is embroiled in a complex scenario with the usual cops won't believe him, wife doesn't believe him, etc. Add to this that Scott has a mistress who works in his office, and you get the ingredients for the melodrama ensuing.I wish I could like this book more, but there are too many distractions. Even though Dass is a wonderful character and his relationship to Evan really nice, his constant ramblings about the Hindu culture get repetitious after a while. Likewise, the constant reflections of Evan's Vietnam days, while helping identify Evan's character and justifying his derring do, they too get a little too repetitive.The book does show Smith's unquestionable talent with words and characterizations; unfortunately, in this case, they're so heavy-handed, we miss the thriller aspect."},{"Title":"Karma","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did.

We tried everything including the Ferber method. Within three days of using one of the scripts in the book it was easy to get him to sleep. If he did wake during the night he would go back to sleep on his own or be easy to sooth and fall asleep. This was using a script right from the book. Even more amazing was when we would fight with him to give nebulizer treatments. As I fought with him through a treatment I made sure he knew what the nebulizer was and it was good medicine.

Although in the end Fr Stephenson (writing in the early 1970s) seems to have abandoned some of the beliefs of the movement, regrettable in my opinion, he still wrote about the movement with a delightful sense of humor - nearly every paragraph ends with a little joke. I first read this book in England and have been to several of the places he describes so well, particularly in and around Oxford."},{"Title":"Merrily on high","review":"I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did. My family kept wondering why I was chuckling so much -- but Colin Stephenson provides a bit of a laugh on nearly every page. He also writes about some heart-rending events with clarity and admirable restraint. Reading this book, I learned about Anglo-Catholicism throughout the 20th century -- and what surprised me is how much is still alive. Like Father Stephenson, I fell in love with the Church when I encountered Anglo-Catholicism. I looked up every place he mentioned, and thanks to the Internet found out that nearly all of them are still vital Anglo-Catholic places of worship. I was blessed enough to visit both Oxford and Walsingham in the last year, and they are exactly as Father Stephenson described them -- St. Mary Mags in Oxford is still a romantic and peace-filled refuge from the busy city streets, and the shrine at Walsingham still exudes mystery and holiness.A word about the ending of the book: Stephenson traces the beginning of the fading away of Anglo-Catholicism to Vatican II. Although he expresses acceptance about this \\"reformation\\" of the Roman Catholic Church, looking back from a 21st century perspective, we now know that the changes after Vatican II accomplished not only the \\"protestantization\\" of the Roman Communion but also encouraged the secularization of the Anglican Communion. Stephenson did not live to see the incredible renewal of Orthodox monasticism on Mount Athos nor the beginnings of English language Orthodoxy, but with his great love for the ancient Church, one can be sure that he would see both as mysterious signs of God's love in a dark world."},{"Title":"Merrily on high","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AUTOBIOGRAPHIES I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. BEGINS AS A \\"COMEDY\\" IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH ANGLICANISM IN GENERAL;AND CONCLUDES IN A PROFOUNDLY MOVING WAY."},{"Title":"Merrily on high","review":"For somebody looking from the outside, Anglo-Catholicism no doubt has the appearance of utter eccentricity. But for Anglicans who proudly wear their Catholicism on their sleeves, this eccentricity is almost certainly part of the reason we find it so mesmerising. To be as an Anglo-Catholic requires, I think, a passionate belief in the Faith, and also the ability to find humour within it. This is certainly the approach taken by Father Colin Stephenson, as he gives an extremely light-hearted account of a life entrenched in the passions, beauties and absurdities of the Anglo-Catholic movement.Father Stephenson was certainly the right man to write such a memoir. His life seems to have been a constant search for the pinnacle high of Tractarianism, from a youth exploring incense-wreathed monasteries to constructing eastward facing Altars on Navy ships as a chaplain during the war. One has no hesitation in believing him as he tells of his conflicts with low-church Bishops, bemused middle-of-the roaders and intense competition with other high-church clerics in creating the brightest shrines to English Catholicism. Little wonder that he was finally appointed as Guardian of Walsingham.At one point in his memoir, Father Stephenson offers the description of a number of priests as being within the Church of England but spending their lives as if they were not. Is this as true of high priests and laity today? If it is true then it is paradoxically so, as so much of defined Anglo-Catholicism has seeped into the \`mainstream'. And yet the Catholicisation of the mainstream has often had the effect, not of producing more spikey Anglicans, but of diluting the fundamentals. It should, therefore, come as no surprise if many old-school Anglo-Catholics continue to operate contently within their Anglican home while, at the same time, appearing totally alien from it.Thus, reading \`Merrily on High', one gets the impression that much of Anglo-Catholicism remains the same today as it was throughout the twentieth century. Smaller and perhaps more fragmented, and certainly less confident, but still driven by the same intense faith, devotion and colourful drama. And these are all qualities that Father Stephenson pours into the pages of this delightful tale."},{"Title":"Merrily on high","review":"I was trained as an Anglo-catholic in the period following Vatican II. It was the beginning of the end of an era. I ordered Colin Stephenson's memoir for an Anglo-catholic friend who came along long after that time to help him have some understanding of \\"where we came from\\". Colin did that admirably."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Writer","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Meanwell is a sincere guy and he has an engaging writing style. However, I don't think that this book will bootstrap many full time professional writing careers.The problem I have with \\"The Wealthy Writer\\" is that Meanwell wound up creating what amounts to a comprehensive survey of the universe of almost all possibilities for selling one's writing, without really focusing on any particular niche. This book is just a bit too glib with the \\"world is your oyster\\" enthusiasm.Examples of the niches that he covers in this book include: writing \\"content\\" for the web, self publication of e-books, speech writing, corporate communications, direct mail, technical writing, and advertising. But he is weak on the reality of marketing to any particular niche. Every niche will be different, with different barriers to entry.Just one example of this problem is technical writing - most markets for technical writing are incredibly specific about the acceptable career background and skill set that they want to see in a writer. You don't just make a mid-life decision that, among your other writing activities, you want to write technical documentation for the medical equipment, DoD, or semiconductor industries. And you *do* have to specialize in order to find technical writing assignments.I also didn't see him address the many notorious wastes of time and career dead ends that exist for freelance writers: two of which are the market for ultra-low-paid blog articles (the likes of $5 paid for an article or so) and the poor dynamics of the \\"outsourcing auction\\" web sites where you compete with other freelancers for projects. I could see someone jazzed from this book plunging into either venue, and working essentially for fast food wages.(Just to be fair, the book is copyright 2004. These markets were not that significant back then. But you could see even at that time, for example, that online sites for finding freelance projects tended to be a \\"traffic jam.\\")I realize that specificity wasn't his goal. But each one of the niches that Meanwell describes in \\"The Wealthy Writer\\" can be the subject of a separate book or course in its own right. What happens is that you read all of these wonderful scenarios for business, and in the final analysis, you have no real idea what you should do.Here's my real point: most freelancers really need to choose one specialized service, and focus on that, in order to get traction as a business. Generalist small businesses that try to be all things to all clients usually get nowhere. If Meanwell does consistent business in every one of the niches that he lists in his book, then he is an incredibly gifted renaissance man. Most of us mere mortals have to specialize in order to get off the ground.I did rate the book higher than I was inclined to, because Meanwell provides some solid operational advice interspersed throughout the book.I agree with the reviewer that recommended Steve Slaunwhite, Peter Bowerman, and Bob Bly's books on breaking into freelance commercial writing over this book. I would personally lean toward \\"The Well-Fed Writer\\" by Bowerman because he thoroughly hammers the marketing issues of starting a writing business.Lastly, I believe that I am well qualified to critique this book from the perspective of a new writer, which is Michael Meanwell's intended target audience. I found few takeaways that I was comfortable with using."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Writer","review":"I didn't think this book was that great. I am interested in starting an on-line writing business and this is the only book I've bought and read so far based on these glowing reviews. It did cover many common-sense aspects of writing and working for yourself but I was disappointed in what it didn't cover: the legal requirements for running your own business and taxes. There was a single line on being a Sole Proprieter. No mention of taxes. No information on websites beyond stating that it would require too much information to cover here and would justify a book in itself. The book focused almost entirely on the author's preferred niche market, writing for companies. Overall I found this book disappointing and dated. If this is the cream of the crop, I shudder to think what the other writing-for-money books are like. This is definitely not a reference book that you will return to again and again. I suspect that the only reason this book has a five star rating is because of the growing cult of cooperative book promotion where one author writes favorable reviews for others in exchange for the same.EDIT: After establishing myself as a writer and earning a steady income myself, I happened to see this book on my shelf and thumbed through it again. In light of my recent experience, I am changing my rating from a three to a one. There really isn't anything helpful in this book."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Writer","review":"This is an excellent resource for anyone who would like to make a good living writing. While it's geared for commercial writing, much of it is also applicable to those who write fiction professionally. If you want your fiction to be read, you need to set up as a business, handle contacts, build a website, and sell your work.I read the book while I was procrastinating about re-designing my website to make it more useful as a marketing tool. It helped me pull my ideas together and present them more effectively--for example, keeping people at my website by providing quickly read pages with links to more material. It worked, too.I emailed a news release to a couple newspapers that I was in the ABNA contest and included a link to my website. One reporter picked up the news release, read everything on the website, and gave me lengthy coverage in two dailies and my home town weekly. She included the website in the article, and so many people visited the site that googling just my last name pulled up my website on the second page!

Its strengths are its practical nature. While many such books are written from an academic standpoint, The Wealthy Writer is entirely practical and simple to read.

This is valuable for those wanting to know what focus they can take, while it also offers established writers new avenues."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Writer","review":"First off, don't ignore my review just because I gave this book one star; I usually ignore one-star reviews myself (one-star reviews are usually not worth considering, since they're usually not critical, just mean). Wow, what a waste of time The Wealthy Writer is. There are SO MANY other books about making a living as a writer out there, and they're all a lot better than this one. There is virtually nothing worth reading here. The book is amateurishly written, \\"padded,\\" repetitive, and full of platitudes and simple, needless advice that goes without saying. It's mainly a bio of the writer, who toots his own horn over and over and over again. He promotes his friends' books. He goes into subjects that are tangental and at times unrelated to writing, such as an entire chapter on overcoming the fear of public speaking. There's plenty of hackneyed life advice here, too. I rarely stop reading a book I've started--I like to finish what I start--but I nearly gave up on this. But--I couldn't! Because it's like a train wreck. I really don't understand how people can think this book is worthwhile. And shame on Writer's Digest Books for publishing this book. It's undermined my confidence in their abilities as a publisher.

My only problem is that it didnt make me feel that I earn over $100,000 a year."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Writer","review":"I often get emails from people who are hoping to make millions with a first novel, generally, as yet, unwritten. Obviously there is a fairly common misconception that breaking into the world of fiction is easy and profitable. It couldn't be further from the truth. Superstar \\"names\\" like John Grisham and Dan Brown may be doing very well from their work (generally due to a powerful marketing team), but most fiction and poetry writers would be receiving a far better hourly rate working on the checkout of a local supermarket or pumping gas. Freelancers looking to make money from magazine articles and other forms of non-fiction fare slightly better, but it\`s still a hard slog, with lots of querying, cold submissions and a long trail of rejections and apprenticeship before the relatively low paying acceptances begin coming in. It is rarely enough money to live on, especially with financial commitments like a family and mortgage. However, there is one branch of writing which is both lucrative, and relatively easy to break into: Commercial writing, or writing communications for business - eg sales letters, speeches, newsletters, brochures, advertisements, public relations material of all kinds, technical writing, and so on is a growing field where good writers are in short supply. Michael Meanwell's The Wealthy Writer is a comprehensive guide to creating, from scratch if need be, a lucrative commercial writing practice. While the book focuses almost solely on commercial writing, Meanwell clearly understands that writers will continue to want to produce creative works like novels and poetry for non-lucrative reasons, and stresses throughout the book that commercial writers will not only be honing their skills, but also creating enough free time to allow for other hobbies.Meanwell is very open about the challenges inherent in becoming a commercial writer, and from the start, gets writers to ask themselves the hard questions about their working style, level of commitment, and even things like family situation and health. The book pulls no punches about the need for a serious business plan (and provides the tools to create one), the need to have a roadmap, putting in place systems and procedures, creating a home office, setting up a professional budget, and how to determine your worth to clients. All of this precedes the writing process and makes it clear how important it is to decide the parameters and capabilities of your business before touting for clients or writing a word of copy.The rest of the book provides a serious guide to ensuring that your writing skills are honed and targeted specifically for the commercial market, and covers such things as how to write technical manuals well, how to produce good quality public relations (including using PR for your own advertising efforts), how to write \\"content\\" for the web (a rapidly growing field where need is beginning to seriously outstrip skill), speech writing, corporate communications, newsletter writing, copywriting and using direct mail. There are also chapters which go into the specifics of marketing your business, pitching for clients, maintaining a successful business where word of mouth is positive, using the flexibility of outsourcing to handle an increasing work load, how to deal with billing, contracts, bad debtors, time management, interviewing as a writing tool, dealing with writer's block, balancing work and life, and giving persuasive power speeches:\\"You don't have to be a naturally funny person to identify and deliver humor, but it helps if you know where to look. The best humor, in my view, is that which you experience or perceive. It's personal, so you're more than likely to deliver it better than secondhand humor you have found elsewhere. Start by observing life. Take notes and record your observationsfor future use. Another deep wellspring of humor resides in your own life. Think about past experiences-embarrassing situations, mistakes you made, and outdated perceptions you had. You've got enough material right there for several stand-up routines!\\"The book is easy to read, and contains lots of point by point (\\"13 things to remember when drafting a press release\\"; \\"5 Steps to Building a Media Database...\\") summaries to make referencing simple, especially as your business diversifies and you need to come back and re-read some sections. If you take Meanwell's advice, this is very likely. Many examples and anecdotes from Meanwell's own experience are provided, with rich photographs, thought provoking case studies using big companies like Telstra and Kodak, and a slightly Escheresque but detailed analysis of the publication process and learnings from his own book The Enterprising Writer. This book contains a lot more meat than The Enterprising Writer which was already pretty hefty in information, and looks at the latest trends in web writing, communication tools, the use of the Internet as a marketing tool, with lots of links for more information, websites to use to obtain work, and a whole lot of templates, samples and even a phone script. There is enough material here to take a novice and turn him or her into a professional, well paid commercial writer. For more experienced writers, this book contains so much information from Meanwell's years of personal experience, that the small investment will very likely translate into more lucrative work.Throughout the book, Meanwell is conscious of the writer's need to be creative, and includes tips on keeping your work fresh, and on how to save time for your passions:\\"We can all develop this ability by using what's been termed\\"possibility thinking.\\" Daydream about what you'd like to achieve. See it in your mind's eye. Feel it, taste it, know that it is already part of your life and that it's within your power to tap into your talent and draw that success toyou. If you do this at the beginning of each day, you'll move closer to having the end result you want in your life. Again, this may be getting a little off base for some people. My point is simply that, in order to get the most out of your creative process, you need to cultivate it by thinking differently. If you want positive action in your life, you need to nourish yourmind with positive thought...\\"Fiction is a wonderful medium to work in, but the chances of making real money from it are relatively slim, especially if you write, as you should, based on your own passions rather than the whims of the marketplace. If you want to earn a regular, reliable income from writing work, commercial writing has got to be your best bet. Meanwell's latest bumper guide is as thorough a one as you'll find for breaking into, and succeeding as a commercial writer, and his witty, down to earth style will ensure that you enjoy the book as much as you find yourself referencing it on a regular basis."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Writer","review":"Of all the guides out there that try to offer advice on freelance writing as a business you could really make a living from, you're most likely to keep this one on your shelf and consult it regularly. You could use Meanwell's encyclopedic advice as a reference for years to come. In the real world, it would be a complete miracle if you wrote the great American novel then had it picked up by an agent. You can reach for those dreams in your free time while following Meanwell's methods of making regular money now, in the freelance commercial writing market. This guide runs the gamut from making your career decision to setting up your business to finding available work in the corporate sector, all with practical knowledge from Meanwell's own successful experience. At times this book delves into too much detail, such as when Meanwell starts describing how to write company newsletters or direct mail submissions. But on the other hand, it's amazing how many different topics he covers about freelance writing as a viable career. There are plenty of other books out there that try to teach you how to write, but this one is among the best for at least getting started on making a living by doing what you love, especially when it comes to running a legitimate business.

Mr. Meanwell doesn't try to hook the reader with generic tips that have no \\"real-world\\" applications; instead, his book is full of specific ideas about how to branch out from the usual freelance jobs into the more unusual, but yet very needed, markets of today that are not as obvious. One thing that I particularly like about \\"The Wealthy Writer\\" is that each chapter not only explains the process for getting the deal, but it also elaborates on how to truly satisfy the customer by going beyond the ordinary. Mr. Meanwell provides unambiguous case studies with actual examples of his own work and explanations of how he succeeded in each example.

Since I'm a copywriter myself, I didn't expect him to write a chapter (the first one) about getting corporate clients for copywriting and technical writing assignments as a financial base to your business, which makes sense. Yet many writers or wannabes won't want to do this because it takes the romance out of being a writer.

Meanwell does have a point or two that one can use but overall this was a waste of money. There was not a lot of \\"how to\\" in the book and most of what he did provide was useless. For example, he gave these tips for smarter layouts:1. add white space between headings, photos, and body copy.2. use subheads, pull quotes, and raised caps as attention grabbers.3. place select stories in colored boxes.4. design in consideration of two matching pages.5. make template layouts for future issues.It seems this should be common sense for those about to launch their own business in copywriting. I would suggest reading SECRETS OF A FREELANCE WRITER by Robert Bly (excellent), START AND RUN A COPYWRITING BUSINESS by Steve Slaunwhite (also very good), and THE WELL FED WRITER by Peter Bowerman (also good).

I thought this one might be a little different from books by American authors, but found largely, what sells in America sells in Australia.I found Meanwell's book to be less engaging at times than Bowerman, Bly or Slaunwhite's books, but also found that he went into much greater (and more appreciated) depth in certain areas. For instance, others simply glazed over speechwriting. Meanwell devotes a very indepth chapter to it.I didn't make nearly as many notes in this book as I did in some of the other similar books, but I can see referring back to this volume on a regular basis. There is a ton of good information here.Where this book falls slightly behind the previously mentioned authors is mostly in the formatting.

First, someone wants you to send them money. Second, they have a book to sell you. Third, it is easy to do. Michael Meanwell doesn't tell you to send him money, buy his book, or explains how easy it is. Instead, he offers writers of all crafts--and specifically business writers--a true way to make it as writers. You may dream of screenplays and novels, but \\"The Wealthy Writer\\" explains the ins-and-outs of setting up a career as a copywriter, technical writer, and internet writer.\\"We need to profit from our craft,\\" Meanwell writes in the opening paragraph of \\"The Wealthy Writer.\\" He also states writers should diversify, invest in themselves, and invest in themselves.\\"I have found it is best to follow the KISS principle--keep it simple, stupid.\\" Meanwell writes, then adds, \\"There will always be plenty of work for good writers.\\"Making it as a writer means making it with companies. For example, often getting that one sale will lead to future sales from the same company.\\"It is not enough to be a good writer,\\" Meanwell states. \\"You need experience in sales, business management, and interpersonal relations.\\"Next, Meanwell tells the aspiring writers to get serious about their business plan. Will you focus on one trade, or multiple? He also offers the thought you should study advertising magazines like \\"Advertising Age.\\"You study the magazines, decide to market yourself, but you still need a basic business plan. Meanwell writes that the next step is to write out some examples of copy, decide how much to charge per hour, and find resources to find out how much to charge.Another prime example found in the text is the big clients all writers dream of getting. He lets readers know the bigger the client, the harder they will be to sell to, especially for a beginning writer. But, these big clients are worth the effort, and once experience is gained they might be easier sells.Meanwell continues the book with explanations on technical writing and provides the eight examples to achieve technical writing riches. Then he approaches online writing, epublishing, and provides strategies to achieve even more success. For example, he says the best selling e-books are often how-to.All in all, Meanwell covers much more than just these examples. Every writer may not have to buy the book, may not have to send Meanwell big checks, but they should not only learn but profit from his advice. This can open the eyes of those writers waiting for the big-fat paychecks. Public relations and advertising will always be huge markets, and crafting multitudes of documents for these and other fields are not easy. The same can be said of publishing an e-book. However, the practical advice given here by Michael Meanwell proves all talented writers can get those fat paychecks if they apply good business sense."},{"Title":"Magnolia Reich: An American Holocaust","review":"This book has a great blend of action and drama.

She brags about all the gifts she got for the babies, all the help she had once they were born, and how she lost all her weight weeks after delivery. This isn't a book for reality minded mothers-to-be. The only good part were the co-author's little comments (her doctor) they were the only factual, informative part of the book, unfortunately, her doctor didn't write enough to make it worth the money."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"Sorry Jane! I know she probably meant well, but let's face it, the majority of us do not have access to her style of living. If you're curious about how the more wealthy people live, go for it. If you're looking for more practical information, you can save money by buying &quot;Multiple Blessings&quot;, packed with much more realistic advice and so much more helpful. I have to admit, I did get a good laugh (sarcastically speaking) out of the &quot;can you believe in all our planning we forgot to put a bathtub in the babies bathroom. We immediately hired a contractor to put one in&quot;. If only I had that problem!"},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"Jane Seymour will never really know what it is like to raise twins, and therefore can't offer any practical advice. Get a full time nurse?? Get real."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"As another reader put it, Jane will never know what it's REALLY like to have twins-most of us can't afford a baby nurse, let alone a nutritionist, personal trainer, chef, etc. She's unbelievable! Do not buy this book unless you want to be depressed."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"This woman lives in cloud cuckoo land. Her advice has absolutely no bearing on most people's everyday reality, and she comes across as a rich, spoilt, pampered woman who has no idea how ordinary people live. This book offers much insight into its author, but very little practical advice for real people. By all means purchase the book if you're sufficiently wealthy and morbidly self-obseesed."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"When we found out that we were expecting twins, a friend with twins recommended this book to us. We found that the book was not very realistic for the every day person. Although the author's story was intersting to read about, we didn't find it at all helpful in preparing for our twins. For a more realistic look at life with twins, I would highly recommend 'Ready or not, here we come' by Elizabeth Lyons."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"Okay this is my first Amazon review ever. You know how you read the reviews, and even if they're bad, you get the book anyhow? Try to give it a chance or whatever? Okay trust me on this one. DON'T DO IT. Right now, the book has a two-star average on Amazon--and I think that's generous at best. Not only does this woman have the special chaise lounge (as mentioned by another reviewer) that's carted EVERYWHERE for her, she also has breakfast (some fancy egg white omelet and extra crunchy hash browns) made for her every morning, maternity clothes crafted expressly to fit her body--and when she decides that the shower adjacent to her new nursery isn't gonna cut it, she has a bathtub put in instead. Huh? Oh and she suggests 24-hour baby nurse care and someone to come do your laundry twice a week. Beg your pardon? Can she suggest the lotto numbers, too? The limited medical advice can be found elsewhere, in other books with actual substance."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"What a waste! This was more a fictional novel than a book that offered practical advise. I was so looking forward to reading a biography on a real twin pregnancy and was dissappointed to read about a womans &quot;diversion&quot; while being spoilt on set by her lavish lifestyle and &quot;wonderful&quot; husband. Don't buy this book if you really need some practical advise."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"Jane Syemour has written a wonderful book about having twins -- as long as you have almost unlimited resources as she has, such as a staff of people, and even designers to make your life easier. Not for real people. Stick to &quot;Having Twins&quot; by Elizabeth Noble."},{"Title":"Two at a Time: Having Twins: The Journey Through Pregnancy and Birth","review":"If you like Jane Seymour and want to know how rich and famous people have twins, buy this book. If you are looking for realistic and practical advice on twins, I'd check out &quot;When You Are Expecting Twins, Triplets or Quads: A Complete Resource&quot;. Jane Seymour's book was entertaining but did not offer much practical advice for the rest of us. It is basically a narration of her pregnancy, down to the details of how she managed to work on a set while pregnant (she had a personal nurse). The book is entertaining if you are a fan. There are some interesting pictures of her with her twins."},{"Title":"Freedom from Stress","review":"As a school Guidance Officer and Counsellor, I have found this book invaluable. It is based on Perceptual Control Theory and shares many similarities to the work of William Glasser and his Choice Theory, although the two authors would probably dispute this. It is particularly relevant for Guidance Officers whose schools have introduced &quot;the Responsible Thinking Classroom&quot; as part of their behaviour management policy. For a counsellor, Ed goes much deeper than a discussion of Perceptual Control Theory. Ed describes valuable techniques he uses in counselling and relates them to his understanding of why we humans do what we do. My only complaint is that I want a follow up book on counselling from Ed but can't seem to find one. I suspect that like many authors of the really great counselling books, Ed is more involved with the practical counselling side of things and simply hasn't had the time to write another book since this one. His style of writing is easy to read and it is one of those books that can be read time and again and each time more is learnt. This book contains much more about human behaviour than a study of stress. If Ed is still around, I hope he reads this review and writes another book on his techniqes of counselling and human behaviour."},{"Title":"Max Deluxe","review":"Maira Kalman is a genius of freshness. a fresh breathness of couleur and &quot;dreamy schemes&quot;...she writes of love, amour, le coeur and life, through the use of a dog who finds a wife.

Some uses vivid imagery and truthful commentary to make a complex story seem simple. The introduction is a great story within itself! Some's world of magic and mysticism is one that will make it seem as if the reader can recreate the rituals for personal spiritual transformation.

I was more interested in village life than in the initiation, but the book drew me into the full story. Malidoma has had a very unusual life. This book is fascinating and well-written. I think it's important because of the excellent discriptions of...everyday village life...the initiation experience...the missionary influence...and, not least, because the Dagara at Dano will be changed by this book. This book should be a must for anyone interested in Africa or real-life magic."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I felt as though I were reading about my own person's life experiences while reading this book.

I have since returned &quot;home&quot;, just as Malidoma did, and begun my trek on the path of self-realization. But, as Malidoma points out, he did not (and cannot) give you the full &quot;4-1-1&quot; on the cultural practices. . . those who are not on the path simply are not allowed to know.

GREAT BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I read this book in the midst of discovering the myriad of hidden truths about african history. Being African American myself I have spent many years trying to undo the backwards education that I was subjected to about my culture in this country by doing extensive research.If for anything, read this book alone to gain an inside experience of what horrors Africans suffered at the hands of missionaries who felt it was their duty to \\"save\\" african children from their \\"barbaric\\" roots. They stole these children away from their villages to bring them up in seminary schools where they were subject to brutal treatment and the brainwashing of their religion. I feel it is people's duty to understand the raw effects of these events as it has also happened to indigenous cultures all over the world.As some reviewers say below, there is a lot about this book that seems fantastical. Malidoma takes us far into the magic and ritual of his culture. It takes an open mind, one that recognizes that the destructive path of colonialism was not only physical but emotional and spiritual. Take time if you will to reflect that if you think colonialism was a destructive force, it also took it's toll on our openess to the possibility of realities other than our own. There isn't hocus pocus in this book, Malidoma a very grounded, extremely well educated gentlemen who has experienced the western world and his traditional one inside out. What he offers in this book is an invaluable opportunity to see the remnants of a culture that we have lost touch with and just how important it is to reconnect to the possibility that what we experience as solid reality is only that which we have been brought up to believe in. It does not mean that it is the only one.Malidoma's writing is also beautiful and engrossing, I couldn't put it down. I was left with a more solid sense of who I was as an African American, I have learned about the advanced architecture and maths that africans had but I had never had a chance to look this deeply into our spiritual history."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I just finished reading the book. I have to say it was an interesting read. At some points however, I did feel like Malidoma was adding his own embellishments to compensate for all the other material that Guisso did not want him to reveal (I might be wrong). The book is an example of how the coming of colonization has changed all facets of life in Africa. Certain interesting features of the cultures have been obliterated. The author makes the point that \\"the (Western) book has totally replaced the elder\\". Africans are just as culpable in this respect in my opinion.I agree that the kidnapping of Malidoma can partially be blamed on the father, who befriended the missionaries, exposing the young Malidoma to vultures. I admire the way in which Patrice balanced the two worlds that had morphed him into what he was. He did it with admirable poise."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"What an amazing writer Malidoma is! He writes with so much first hand and eloquently expressed insight into the disparities between the Western mindset and the consciousness of African village life with its inconceivable mysteries and traditions. This book makes books of questionable authenticity such as Mutant Down Under and the Don Juan books seem silly and mundane; the magical unfoldings witnessed by Malidoma are beyond even the wildest events in Harry Potter, and yet you can feel the authenticity of Malidoma's experience in his rich and heartfelt language.I wish I could get to one of his workshops!"},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Patrice Some's fascinating account of his life, against the backdrop of his native culture (the Dugara people) and the infiltration of Western missionaries, is visionary, liberating, and mind-expanding.His initiation into shamanism is a journey into the underworld, powerful spirits of the ancestors, dead men walking, other dimensions, and is as mystical and otherworldly as it gets.Some's experiences reveal a profound cultural chasm between Western and African cultures, and gives one an insight into the current state of Africa, and the reasons for that. Patrice Some is also a great commentator as he has lived in both worlds. Highly recommended for people with an open mind about other cultures, shamanism, mysticism, colonialism, and african spirituality."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Reading about this man's spiritual journey in a different culture completely changed my perspective on life as we live it here in the US.

I could feel Malidoma's pain in his struggle with the evil criminals that complicated his life.

Very inspiring."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Malidoma Some's book is truly a mixed blessing! He writes about his personal experiences and life journey, about the spirituality of his people and the contrasts between the African Mindset and the ideas and pre-conceptions of Western people/white people.Some parts of this book truly deserve 5 starts, other parts deserve 0! The most important part of this book is indeed Mr Some's return to his own village and his struggles to re-claim his own roots. Every practitioner and every seeker of African religions should have a look at this section of the book. It clearly shows that the western mindset can hinder us from fully embracing what African spirituality has to offer and how different the TRADITIONAL African mindset is to the mindset of western people. Just like Mr Some, who in the course of his journey realized that his \\"Europeanization\\" hindered him from fully embracing his own tradition, so should many Europeans who search for \\"greater powers\\" within the African traditions examine their own preconceptions and ideas. This part alone deserves 5 starts!Other parts of the book read much like a fiction story and should be take with a big pinch of salt. This being said, some of the things Mr Some describes can still be found within African Traditional Religions in the West - visible spirit manifestations being just one example. However, others are rather dubious...0 stars for that part of the work!"},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"first of all, i would like to have it known that i am 15, and i had to read this book for AC Writing Workshop. the first 4 or 5 chapters are very dull. the next few chapters are mildly distrubing, for he gets molested, and it is hinted that other boys are getting raped. later on, the book gets better. this book is entertaining, but unrealistic, i highly disagree with its title as an autobiography, for there is no way many of these happenings could have taken place. if it was classified as a fictional story, i would have no problem, but it is classified as an autobiography. i believe that many of his \\"experiences\\" have to do with either, dehydration, heat stroke, hallucinagents, or hypnosis. it is impossible for someone to jump into a light portal and disappear into another dimension. for this reason, i would not recomend using this book for a class, for it is completely ridiculus. it is entertaining towards the latter half of the book, the author occasionally slips into a few instances when he uses circumlocution, but other then that, its not too bad. read this book, if ur believe in spirits, but i would not recomend it if u are into science, and the phisical limits of certain things, for this book is completely contradictory to \\"western\\" beliefs.John G."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"A moving account of an young man experiencing early in his life the wisdom of an elder and then taken away from his tribe and indoctrinated into a life of missionary brainwashing.

It struck me as a nonfiction that read as a fiction novel. The downside is that Malidoma learns something deep in this novel, but the reader is not privy to his experience: even Malidoma says that a lot of what he sees cannot be described, for personal reasons or due to the limits of our language. It is a palpatable feeling of loss when Malidoma comes out of his experience enlightened, but many readers would not.I would recommend this book for people who already live in a world of fiction: Malidoma has seen a lot of things that defy Western \\"reality,\\" and some straightlaced readers may not be able to accept or respect Malidoma enough to continue reading. If you can suspend your beliefs, however, the book is completely engrossing: I found it hard to put down! Malidoma is a sympathetic character in his own book, and characterizes the people he met very well.The book itself is jam-packed full of text: a cursory glance at the textual presentation makes you blink. Take a look at an excerpt above.I found this book hard to put down.

Like the author, I have attended a christian school from early age and was rather a faithful christian even if I could still feel a certain emptiness in me in regard to the merits of that spiritual path. I have come to realize, through diverse inquiries that most of the christian religious foundations are mere borrowing of African spirituality. From such a perspective, it was therefore important for me to return to the core teachings of African religious practices and garner as much wisdom as possible! I was not ready to be faced with so much knowledge ranging for sciences, to arts, to philosophy, aesthetic...etc. I grew extremely angry for I realized that all these \\"sciences\\" have been painted to me as foreign were well alive in our cultures, yet like many other young Africans, I have ignored them. My embracing of my African spirituality has made me a complete person, confident, proud and ambitious. Indeed, knowledge is a weapon and we African must re-arm ourselves with our million years legacy and diverse civilization and try to incorporate them into today's technological age."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"This book is a transformative agent that releases the Western mind of all false concepts of spirituality and the spiritual world.

Plus the man is far more of a poet, a seer and a deep philosophical thinker than these others. You'll not find a better writer on matters mystical and religious probably anywhere, at least not in the 'confessional/autobiographical' literature.Then again, herein are so many quotable passages that you could meditate on to form the beginnings of a new personal philosophy, it's really quite stunning. And it all seems like it equally extends from your own body and heart. This is in contradistinction, say, to a well-written but rather dry and compartmentalized account such as J. S. Danquah's 'The Akan Doctrine of God'*, which is more meant for those who enjoy the scholarly treatise, but might never wish to imagine themselves venturing into village life.Malidoma was kidnapped by the local priest a couple of days after his father was installed as clan leader, soon after his grandfather's death. He was only 4 years old. He does not pull any punches in detailing the horrible physical and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of these churchly personages, who made him and other young kidnapees and orphans total slaves to their colonialist/catechumenical education system. After over 16 years of this, the young man escaped and managed to walk back to his village over a hundred miles away. The remainder of the book is a very detailed and intense re-telling of selected experiences he was party to during his subsequent clan initiation. This constitutes the last 100 pages or so of the book. I can't begin to express how astonishing are the experiences, the images, emotions etc. represented on these pages.Suffice to say that the man is an absolute wizard at using the English language. Carlos Caste&ntilde;eda and especially Lynn Andrews seem like comic book literacy after you've dipped even a little bit into Malidoma.I met Mr. Som&eacute; briefly at a Sun Bear Medicine Wheel Gathering a number of years ago; his personality is every bit as engaging as is his writing. His was a kind of quiet charisma, extending from which is an amazing, almost madcap sense of humor. You feel that his energy is entirely sincere, and that there's far more there than meets the eye. You can feel it, and yes, 'almost' begin to see into it, and with it.If Nick Black Elk had written his own book rather than having his texts filtered through John C. Neidhardt, it likely would have approached the book-length intensity we find here. Then again I read 'Black Elk Speaks' over 30 years ago; Neidhardt's account might seem much greater at this point of my own life journey.* the Akan peoples, actually a different cultural group, lived a hundred or so miles southeast, in Ghana."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"This book brought me to places of wonder that I vaguely remember as a child.

Even from the introduction, Malidoma Patrice Some engages the reader with compelling observations on the limitations of the &quot;Western&quot; worldview, but does not do so in a derisive way. He conveys, in a very moving life story, his role in the current world and tells how he has lived up to the mission foretold in his given name. What I especially liked, having read several other books on various spiritual traditions, was how the rituals and beliefs of the Dagara resonate with the wisdom found in traditions from Wicca to the &quot;new age&quot; ideas put forth in books like The Celestine Prophecy and Conversations with God. I was sad to come to the end of this book, because I wanted to learn more. I hope Some' will write a sequel that continues his story, as well as those of his father, Guisso, Nyangoli, and others he has encountered on his path through his adult life. This book reaffirms the truth of our divine nature; and powers that we in the West need to accept and &quot;understand&quot; without needing scientific &quot;proof&quot;.

While a lot has been published about Native American (both North and South), Tibetan, Altaic, Celtic etc. tribal life, rather little is known about Africa. Malidoma Some's book therefore provides a welcome and highly inspiring contribution.With this book Malidoma ('Be Friends With the Enemy') creates a bridge into a world where a person's life is linked inextricably to the breathing of his village and where his destiny interlocks with that of his ancestors, his children and the rhythms of nature. It is a world imbued with meaning; the Dagara share it with tree and animal spirits, with supernatural entities (the kontomble, the \\"star people\\") and with ancestors who provide guidance and support. Malidoma also addresses topics of universal importance to all of us. What is a complete human being? Why does one need to be \\"initiated\\" into living in order to be \\"real\\"? How do we awaken and use all the resources stored in the \\"inner museum of our being\\"; what is the role of mystery and awe in the unfolding of our destinies and how does one learn to become available to them?The book is written along the lines of ancient storytelling, and in a flowing delicate prose which radiates human warmth and respect for life. MS does a great job in depicting the Dagara as a spiritually aware people still attuned to their roots and their land. I understand that now, after his father's death, Malidoma has returned to Africa (temporarily abandoning his privileged and lucrative position within the Western \\"shamanic circuit\\") to assume his duties as a leader of his clan and as a mediator between the worlds that his people still remember and give homage to. He is a savy man who demonstrated to us all that befriending the enemy brings gifts to all involved in the process as it combines and integrates different yet complementary pools of knowledge. Myself I listen with deep appreciation and respect as the Dagara sing:I want to be what I know I am,And take the road we alwaysForget to take.Because I heard the smellOf the things forgottenAnd my belly was touched."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Malidoma's life alone was a mini-representation of our entire experience as Afro-americans. He was kidnapped as a child from his Dagaran village and raised in a Christian missionary school. His own father was somewhat responsible for his kidnapping, because against the will of the elders, his father became friends with a Christian pastor and allowed him into the village (sound familiar?). One day, the pastor came and grabbed Malidoma without a word and took him to the missionary school (he was stolen, but he had access to the village...who's to blame? Sounds like the current debate :). Malidoma was subjected to all types of abuse as he was force to think as a European. There were European AND African teachers taking part in the brain-washing (sound familiar?). He was put into quarters with African boys from all over...many didn't even speak his native tongue (sound familiar?). As he and his new friends became older...they started to become more aware of their situation and the oppression. They remembered the pain and suffereing of the past and became rebellious. Although they had a small union, most of the other boys were too afraid to fight and some were even convinced that the Euro-education they received although through force, was a blessing that placed them above their &quot;inferior&quot; past (!). One day Malidoma struck out against a preist during class and ran away from the mission. He managed to walk nearly 300 miles back to his village that he wasn't even sure existed anymore. I was a long and HARD journey (!) and he finally arrived...only to realize just how &quot;white&quot; he had become (!). He was no longer a Dagaran...BUT fortunately his elders decided to give him a chance. He was allowed to risk his life in Dagaran initiation (VERY interesting part of the book) and he survived, reborn as a Dagaran. He still retained the European part engrained in him...he couldn't help this, but his wise elders saw usefulness in this. They ordered him to live outside of the village in the white world and to serve as a bridge of knowledge between the two worlds. Malidoma currently holds a Ph.D. and lives here in America. He holds many seminars and his life mission is to &quot;fight&quot; the battle between the Old and New world by teaching New-worlders the importance of ancestors and rituals. Malidoma literally means &quot;To befriend the enemy&quot;.This book is a must-read. Although I have written a summary here...it does not even scratch the surface. I just touched upon the most memorable parallels..there are many more."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"There are many of us in-between Africans for whom the mindless runaway train of Western living has failed. After shunning our pasts, our land, our blackness and our ancestors, no matter how hard we may have tried to lose ourselves in foreign ideaologies, there's still an emptiness inside. Thank God that Malidoma appeared. When I read this book a few years ago, whatever complexes lingered in me about my African-ness flew out the window. I have grown tired of en vogue directionless movements that exist almost only for the purpose of allowing individuals to feel good - in the guise of spiritual growth - without the necessary psychological catharsis. Thank God I'm an African woman, albeit an angry one. My anger and consternation increases everyday when I see the continuous exploitation and decimation of my people and our continent. But more than that, I am angered by the fact that so many Africans seem oblivious to the status quo and aren't interested in finding out what role we have played in the destruction of our race and home. A people will always be what they have always been. We Africans need to realise once and for all that spiritual awareness will never come from losing ourselves in another's ways. Find out who you are and where you come from. Go back to your source. Because surely, what have we gained from the West that is so much more meaningful than the knowledge of who we really are? May Malidoma keep helping us."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Any westerner who has ever wanted to know how an African thinks should read this book by Malidome Some. Because he was kidnapped out of his own culture and brought up in a Catholic seminary (where the priests wanted to turn out Black Christians prepared to go out and convert their fellows), Some was given the tools he needed to make an African sensibility understandable to a westerner. When he ran away from the Catholics and returned to his tribal home, he found that his family and fellow villagers saw him as so contaminated by his exposure to White ideology/learning that he was a danger to them. They gave him the option of undergoing the rite of initiation which boys usually go through in their 13th year. Some was 20 and he had to overcome his foreign-implanted mindset in order to survive the ordeal and become an initiate in his own tribe. The story begins with his close relationship with his grandfather, a tribal elder, when Some was only four years old. His earlier exposure to his grandfather's wisdom helped him survive the initiation. Some now straddles the two very different worlds and is living and teaching in California."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Kidnapped from his home by white Christian brothers who brutalise him as part of his 'training' to become a priest, Malidoma describes his amazing journey back to his home village in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The only way he can be truly accepted as one of his people - the Dagara - is to undergo a dangerous and possibly deadly initiation. The second half of the book illustrates the poetic, mythical and very real ordeal Malidoma undergoes in order to truly return home. This powerful, moving book illustrates how African traditions are under threat and how we must learn to live harmoniously with people who are different from us - even the 'stranger and enemy'."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I just finished this book and I am hungry for much, much more. Malidoma Some's deep wisdom, wide vision, vulnerability and honesty stirred my soul so deeply. This book has awakened my yearning to re-connect with Nature and the Spirit world like no other I have read. I found his vivid, well-paced storytelling and the wisdom of his people utterly fascinating. I wish to thank the Dagara for being so generous in sharing their wisdom through this man. If I could give this book 20 stars, I would!!"},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"Malidoma, born in what is now Burkina Faso, West Africa, was his shaman grandfather's shadow until age four. That year his grandfather died, and Malidoma was kidnapped from his home by a French Jesuit missionary. For the next 16 years he suffered almost every kind of abuse as he was trained in Western culture. He escaped at age 20 and, walking 300 miles from the seminary, found his way back to his tribal village, where he now was an outsider. The elders offered him the opportunity to participate in an intensive six-week shamanic initiation with younger tribal boys which, if he survived, would reestablish his connection to the tribe. After undergoing the initiation, Malidoma learned that his destiny lay in being a bridge between Western civilization and indigenous culture. Studying in the Sorbonne and Brandeis University, he now holds three master's degrees and two PhDs. Though he returns regularly to his tribal home for renewal, he makes his home in the U.S. where he has taught at the University of Michigan and now leads seminars, intensives, and rituals.Malidoma's open, vulnerable, detailed stories of his experiences in the Jesuit school and in his initiation are riveting. I noticed two major lessons that his culture can teach ours. One is to connect our bodies to our minds. When Malidoma first came to the U.S., he saw with the spirit eyes of his elders that people's heads were not connected to their bodies. There was a blank space where the neck should be. One aspect of this is that we place great importance upon words. Malidoma says: \\"The speech of silence is achieved when words, and their potential ability to hurt meaning, are done away with. Words entrap meaning, torture it, slice it into pieces the way a butcher cuts the meat of a slaughtered animal and serves it to us. . . In silence, meaning is no longer heard, but felt; and feeling is the best hearing, the best instrument for recording meaning.\\" The second lesson is the importance of wise elders. In Malidoma's words: \\"Elders and mentors have an irreplaceable function in the life of any community. Without them the young are lost -- their overflowing energies wasted in useless pursuits. The old must live in the young like a grounding force that tames the tendency toward bold but senseless actions and shows them the path of wisdom. In the absence of elders, the impetuosity of youth becomes the slow death of the community.\\" This is a book that changes the reader."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"A fantastic book about Malidoma's journey through both the world of thought and logic that is our western world and a deep spiritual world of the Dagara. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to live in both worlds - where the logical claims that the spiritual cannot exist and the spiritual explains things that logic cannot comprehend. A great read that helps us to understand why we do some of the things that we have to do, and helps us to get out of our own way to do the work."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I had to read this book for my human spirituality class. I have always been interested in learning about religions but have never been religious myself. After reading this book I was totally a believer. And the thing is, the author doesn't try to convince the reader of anything at all, he is simply telling his story and describing his experiences. Malidoma Patrice Some has an amazing story to tell, it relates to so many issues and deals with subjects that are not only religious. I tend to prefer cultural books written by people who were actually born into the culture. Malidoma was born into the Dagara culture, kidnapped as a child, and escaped back to his tribe after many years. so in a way he is an insider and an outsider at the same time, which gives a great point of view. it was really an amazing story.I also would like to mention for any fellow dyslexics or low level readers out there, I have dyslexia and have always had a miserable time reading books, but this book was surprisingly easy to read. since the author first two languages were not english, his english writing skills are apparently not the best, so the book has been written in a simple way so it is easy to read. :)"},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I had to read this for class, so be aware that this did very much influence my review.If you're like me and had to read this for a class, don't worry. This isn't as difficult as your teacher said it would be. This isn't a light and frothy jaunt through one man's self-discovery though, it's full of Malidoma's pain and confusion as he's abducted and placed in a barbaric missionary school and seminary. The good thing is that it's pretty readable and best of all, does have a happy ending. If you're someone who loves reading stuff like this regardless of whether you're a student or not, you'll enjoy this book. Malidoma tries to go into as much detail as he can about his initiation.Malidoma has a great voice here and while there are some things that I didn't understand entirely, the author is pretty open in the beginning that some things just can't be translated to another language because there's no equivalent. He still does a good job of showing what life is like in West Africa for boys and men. The only thing he omits is a deeper depiction of how women are viewed and treated in his society, but since this book is predominantly about Malidoma's struggle to return home and go through initiation, this can be forgiven.I'd really like to see a follow up book."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"I am over 50 years old. This is the history of my people that we were not taught in school - are not taught in schools now.

Your strength is a testiment to all of us of what a human being can overcome. I plan to read everything you've written and pray that it heals me from my indoctrination from western ideology. I also want to say that I never knew that African children were indoctrinated like Native American and Alaskan Native children. Religon was used as a tool of war - it still is. Your book has helped me to understand the ideology of the Tea Party and Christian conservatives in the United States. So much to heal from. So much to learn.

It is the story of a boy kidnapped from his African village by French Jesuits who use brutality to indoctrinate him into Christianity. He escapes at age 20 and returns to his village where he undergoes a six week initiation back to his pantheistic, earth-based religion. His hallucinatory experiences during the initiation are incredibly vivid and powerful, and will forever change the way you look at so called primitive spirituality. After reading this book I did some African drumming and Native American drumming and began my own connection with primal religions, something that has greatly enhanced my life."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"This is my first written review, I have to say this is the best book I have read for a very long time, Malidoma is a wonderful writer, this book is so compelling I could not put it down. Malidoma's account of his own life and his experiences growing up in a Jesuit missionary make him vulnerable and transparent to the reader, I feel he shared with me his deepest secrets while educating me about colonialism. When he returns to his village without his si (double) he has to go through an initiation process to gain himself back and be integrated and accepted back into his tribe. His elders remind him he learns by remembering. If you are interested in the super natural, shamanism, and African wisdom this book will satiate you to no end.

Well, I read the book and just by reading the introduction alone made me not want to put the book down. I knew that i was in for a reading that would be mind-boggling, thought provoking, powerful and profound. Brother Malidoma did not disappointment me at all.Every chapter had a lesson behind it. The most impressive and powerful was when Malidoma returned to his village and his elders sanctioned him to be initiated. Eventhough he couldn't go into great detail, the experience that he could share was priceless. This is one of those \\"rare\\" books in which you use as a basis to measure the quality against others.

Would we as Americans like for someone of another culture to destroy our televisions, computers, fax machines, microwaves pagers and cell phones? I think not."},{"Title":"Of Water and the Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman","review":"\\"Suddenly it has become popular to defend tribal people, their world, their view, and their lifeways. But while the West is engaged in a great debate about what it means to preserve culture, the indigenous world is already aware it has lost the battle. It seems obvious to me that as soon as one culture begins to talk about preservation, it means it has already turned the other culture into an endangered species.\\" And so Malidoma Patrice Some recounts his life in 2 worlds, the western world which kidnapped him from his Dagara village and his native culture in which he no longer quite fits having been raised by Jesuits who took harsh measures to see him relieved of his primitive culture and saved by the Christian faith. Malidoma remembers trying to believe and praying to the Christian God to save him and relieve his suffering, but no help came.His relationship to his grandfather, the village priest and I guess what we would call sorcerer is fascinating. He writes his grandfather was believed to be able to kill enemies by the magical means of firing an upside arrow and the intent to do rid the world of the enemy and that person would die even though not physically wounded. His memories of his life in the Dagara village are poignant as we also see a magical way of life vanishing when he returns. Malidoma was kidnapped when he was about 4 or 5 and he returns when he is around 20. He is disconnected from the culture he longed to rejoin and so the elders decide the way to \\"cure\\" him is to send him to the school of the ancestors and be trained according to custom in which he is initiated into their spiritual/shamanistic ways. I found it amusing as he tells of how he can't \\"see\\" and lies to try and trick his elders, which of course they detect. He also tells of an incident in which a boy is lost between the cracks of the worlds and asks why the knowledge couldn't be acquired safely and thus he shows there is danger in the initiation akin to some of the vision quests better known to us in the West.Many of the villagers soon scorn the old ways and leave to join the Western world where the \\"book had replaced the elder.\\" Malindoma also rejoins the Western world, going to university and trying to reconcile the 2 worlds into which he has been initiated. As Malidoma alludes to in his book, while the colonialism killed many a culture the native or indigenous cultures also have some responsibility for the death of their own culture. Those who have decided to embrace Western culture and capitalism and abandon their spiritual/cultural ways added to the decline of their indigenous ways. All things change though and cultures have a way of reasserting themselves. Malindoma muses that \\"elders do not see the details, they see the overall picture. If the picture is good, the hardship of the detail doesn't matter.\\"And so off Malidoma went to \\"be swallowed\\" by Western culture and fulfill their vision for him carried in his name Malindoma, which means \\"he who makes friends with the stranger/enemy.\\" One has the sense through his journey his culture was preserved through his memories.I wonder if this book is embellished and how much of Malindoma's early memories can be relied on since he was very young when he was kidnapped. And as he writes himself, they do not separate imagination from the supernatural and surely he imagined much while with the Jesuits dreaming of his previous life in Dagara. And if some of his accounts are fantastic, perhaps we should view them as the myths we create to give voice to our spirit. It is a well written book that will not bore the reader. Malidoma claims he was lazy at university, skipping classes and reading the answers to exams in his professor's auras. Given the level of writing I seriously doubt that."},{"Title":"The Umpire's Handbook","review":"This book is excellent for umpires.

Influencing a patient with thumb/finger sucking habits (blanket and pacifiers as well) is quite challenging. My job is to try to help the patient stop their habit in a non-invasive manner, when possible. Using this book, along with some personal counseling, over 95% of my patients have stopped their habit within 3 months. I follow these patients for a year, and the cessation is complete. This is a remarkable success rate when compared to the rates listed in the literature. The patient's parents are out no money (they borrow a copy of the book from me), and thousands of dollars in orthodontic treatment due to flared upper front teeth (\\"buck teeth\\") can be avoided. Aren't braces needed to bring the upper front teeth back into alignment? Most of the time, no. The backward resting pressure of the upper lip alone tends to bring the incisors back into a good archform. Technical note: If the child has a \\"Class II\\" bite, then orthodontic treatment may be needed in the future. Incidentally, the flaring of the front teeth caused by a sucking habit increases the risk of fracture of these teeth during a sporting accident or fall. This is another reason to stop the habit.

He saw the pictures of the older siblings in the book with the bad overbites and braces and inspected each picture very carefully trying to understand how the teeth got \\"broken\\" (his view). The pictures could have been better, but my son got the idea that the teeth were messed up from thumbsucking.At the end of the story, I got the most interesting reaction from him- he became very upset and told me he didn't want to suck his thumb anymore because he doesn't want his teeth like that. But that it would be hard. So we decided on \\"incentives\\" (a new toy) if he doesn't suck his thumb for 20 days. I had no idea that reading this book to him would trigger such an emotional response. Since reading the book he has been very good about not sucking his thumb, and we put a band aid on his thumb at night to help him.I didn't think the book would make such an impact but it did.

This book has nothing to do with processors, Moore's Law and bus architecture, yet it has everything to do with what you get when you take those and build machines and connect them into a pervasive network.It's all about social impact, the undelivered promises of the technology, and debunking conventional thought (assumptions, really) about the value computers and networks bring to society. This is certainly a book for policy makers in business and government, educators and socially-aware technoligists.After you're read this excellent, thought-provoking book, read &quot;World Without Secrets: Business, Crime and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing&quot; by Richard Hunter.

However, the next book in the series, \\"A Purple Place for Dying,\\" does take place right after this one, so there is an advantage to reading them in order.In \\"Nightmare\\" Travis goes to New York. If you can't deal with that, then this one's not for you, but otherwise it's a knockout. The suspense is great, the philosophizing feels amazingly current, and MacDonald clearly knows New York. The book is great mix of retro setting and modern-feeling plotting and characterization. If anything, it's smoother than \\"The Deep Blue Good-By,\\" since it doesn't need to introduce anything.The Travis McGee series is terrific. I'm still reading my way through it, but I haven't found any reason not to go in order. \\"Nightmare in Pink\\" is great."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"Nightmare in Pink is my second Travis McGee (and the second in the series), and it is even more riveting than the first.McGee gets a call from an old war buddy who is in a VA hospital. Mike Gibson is blind and disabled, and when he asks McGee to check something out for him, McGee acquiesces-mostly out of guilt. Mike's beautiful and younger sister, Nina, is engaged to be married when her fianc&eacute; is mysteriously killed in a mugging. While cleaning out his things, Nina discovered $10,000 (we're talking 1960's here) and thinks he was in on something shady. The police haven't been able to solve the mugging and they haven't been told about the money, so McGee agrees to snoop around. Unfortunately, the case is in New York City and this Florida boat-bum is literally a fish out of water.Mike and Nina quickly join forces (in more ways than one) and uncover a complicated financial scam to rob the fianc&eacute;'s former boss of millions. Of course, the closer they get to solving the crime, the more they expose themselves to danger. At one point, McGee is even drugged, kidnapped, and held against his will in a mental hospital, where he is subjected to experimental hallucinogens. How he escapes will have you on the edge of your seat.McGee again continues with many profound observations. One that I especially liked is \\"A good listener is far more rare than an adequate lover.\\"Nightmare in Pink had only two drawbacks that I could see. As with The Deep Blue Good-By, this book is a bit light at 143 pages. Also, while the plot was riveting, it was also unbelievable in spots. But John D. MacDonald has a new fan, and I have A Purple Place for Dying up next."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"Unlike the first Travis McGee novel, The Deep Blue Goodbye, which is set in Fort Lauderdale, McGee's stomping grounds and the place he likes to call home, Nightmare in Pink takes him to the Big Apple, where he is a sailor away from the sea and not altogether comfortable. His mission is to help the sister of a friend who finds herself with a dead boyfriend and ten thousand dollars she thinks are ill gotten gains.With some shrewd detective work McGee determines that the boyfriend stumbled on to the scheme of a lawyer who is bilking his rich client of millions of dollars. McGee makes connections with the client's family, who commission him to find out what is happening and protect the family and estate. Easier said than done.McGee thinks he has the case well in hand only to find he has been careless. His carelessness almost kills him. From the moment McGee finds himself trapped in his Nightmare in Pink to the exciting conclusion, the action is fast and furious with many innocent dead bodies along the way.As is typical of a McGee mystery, loose ends are not always neatly secured. Sometimes bad things happen to the good guys. McGee is nothing is not a realist and he accepts what he must and has the scars to show for it. He is a survivor who will live to fight another day.All the Travis McGee novels are quick reads and page turners. Once a reader has been initiated into the McGee philosophy and lifestyle with The Deep Blue Goodbye and Nightmare in Pink, the rest of the series is sure to be an attractive alternative to watching tv for diversion and entertainment."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"If there is a weak link in the chain of Travis McGee novels, I have yet to find it. MacDonald's \\"Nightmare in Pink\\" is yet another great tale in the long list of books of the McGee cycle, and I have read more than a dozen of them. This one has the same driving pace, magnetic and realistic characters, and acerbic wit as any other in the series. What makes it personally enjoyable is that it is set in my hometown of New York City! He seems at home here, in spite of what he says. I wish he'd hung around for a few more novels"},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"This is the official 'second' in John D. MacDonald's series about Travis McGee, the slightly tarnished knight from Lauderdale, whose chosen steed is a 52 foot houseboat. Second also in setting the general pattern of McGee books - a friend convinces McGee to take the case of another friend, usually a beautiful woman, and McGee grudgingly comes to the rescue - sometimes out of a sense of honor, and sometimes just for the money.This time the 'asker' is Mike Gibson, a war buddy of McGee's who now lives as a permanent resident of the veteran's hospital. The 'fixee' is Nina, Mike's sister - distraught when her boyfriend (Howard Plummer) dies in a mugging. Nina finds a large bundle of money in a closet and becomes convinced that Howard was up to no good. Now Mike wants to help her out of her depression, even if she is unwilling. McGee, as usual, to the rescue.As you might expect, Plummer's death was not what it seemed, and McGee finds himself enmeshed in a spectacular fraud that is bilking a company of millions while sending its victims to a mental ward. Which is where McGee winds up as well, in a nightmarish twist that plays like 'On Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' Dropped into a hole from which there is no way to escape, McGee must fight for survival against a medical staff determined to steal his mind from him.Perhaps the beauty of this story, other than MacDonald's powerful writing, is that it turns the 'tough-guy detective' genre on it's ear for a bit as McGee struggles with induced insanity, falls in love, and barely survives by the skin of his teeth. This is a tough-guy with plenty of weaknesses and soft spots. McGee, who serves as narrator, doesn't try to explain away his moments, good and bad, but reports them with a straightforward touch that makes him and easy favorite.While this may not be the best of the series, for some reason it rings true and is one of my favorites. It predicts many of the themes and tricks that will go on to be imitated time and again. But never with quite the &eacute;lan than MacDonlad has."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"This 2nd of the Travis McGee series takes place in New York City where Travis fits about as well as Crocodile Dundee. John D. has not quite found his way with Travis yet, and it shows.Travis is enjoined to look out for a buddy&#65533;s little sister in the big bad city. Little sister is a babe (surprise!) and has her share of troubles. Her fianc&eacute; has just been murdered, and she has found a stash of $10,000 that she fears he scammed. Nina is distressingly a &#65533;will you respect me in the morning&#65533; type of young lady that rings no truer now than it did in the early &#65533;60s, and Travis&#65533; famous philosophizing is really put to the test, however enchanted he is.&#65533;Nightmare in Pink&#65533; is worth the price of admission just for the middle third of the book where Travis is captured in a private mental hospital and loaded with psychedelic drugs. His hallucinatory terrors are brilliantly and horrifyingly described, and the after-effects linger through the entire book.The plot is a convoluted financial scam that MacDonald loves, but doesn&#65533;t suit Travis too well (Meyer is not yet on the scene). Also cold, urban settings are not kind to a knight errant beach bum. Grade C-"},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"John D.

She's a babe, of course, and McGee helps her unravel a complicated financial scam while curing what ails her with some of his own, patented expert hay rolling.Along the way, he makes a major error and winds up trapped in a crooked mental hospital straight out of \\"Shock Corridor\\" but with nurses delivering doses of refried LSD and brain melting sedatives.This is a creepy installment. An early rant by MacDonald, about how one day a minor altercation on the streets of New York will lead to a riot that will wipe out the city, sets the tone; things get really nasty when Trav slips and falls into the clutches of the scheming Dr. Varn -- I don't think MacDonald was much of a recreational drug user but his descriptions of the wrong kind of hallucinations do a good of depicting a bad trip.Before McGee escapes, some pretty terrible things happen to him; he also has to resort to some seriously dirty tricks and, by the end, he's a basket case. This being only the second outing by McGee, it's odd to think that MacDonald would bang up his tough guy hero so badly, so early.

Great summer reading!"},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"With a strong, moody debut novel (\\"The Deep Blue Good-By\\") and this bang-up follow-up, it's sure been easy to finally slip into John D. MacDonald's classic \\"Travis McGee\\" series.The fast, taut \\"Nightmare in Pink\\" is set in New York City and its environs and concerns white collar crooks scamming millions from unsuspecting investors. I expected a decent story, and more than got that, but what I didn't expect was a scary one. I mean, horror-novel scary. And I got a kick out of being caught unaware like that.You see, the crooks here have a very special way of lulling their marks into submission, and, just as chilling, of getting the curious and other threats to their scam out of the way. I won't get too specific, but let's just say these methods involve shady physicians, unsupervised mental health facilities, and certain controversial (even in the early 60's, when this story is set) cranial operations involving long, thin, shiny implements. And, yes, our man McGee gets into quite a spot involving these factors. Will his sharp mind survive the book intact?In addition to the chills and suspense, other satisfying elements include a nicely drawn friendship between McGee and an old war buddy, an eventual romance with the war buddy's daughter (which gallant McGee tries to resist at first), and McGee's usual, and still fascinating, mental pronouncements about this or that aspect of American life. It helps that McGee's opinions about things still resonate and make us nod in agreement more than forty years after MacDonald wrote them.It's been said that this series didn't really start to pick up stream until about the fifth or sixth book. If that's the case, those upcoming books must REALLY be good, because \\"Nightmare in Pink\\" and the entry before it are both fine, satisfying reading experiences, laced with thrills, emotion, intelligence, and surprises."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"I recently read an article that compared Ian Fleming's James Bond with John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee. Both series came to prominence around the same time, and both would be considered \\"men's fiction\\" of the era, with the heroes getting into various adventures and sleeping with various women. The parallels are rather limited, however: Bond is actually a tamer character than McGee and less given to true cynicism. And though Fleming is good, MacDonald is better (and with slightly less dated views, the McGee books age a bit better too).Nightmare in Pink is the second novel featuring McGee and MacDonald is clearly hitting his stride, giving his lead character more definition. We learn early on that McGee is a veteran of the Korean War (which puts his age in this 1964 book at somewhere in his thirties). McGee had a friend in the war, who was severely wounded while McGee was on leave; survivor's guilt has put McGee in Mike Gibson's debt, so when Mike asks for a favor, McGee is ready to help out.He goes to New York, a city that doesn't really agree with his beach-bum persona and visits Mike's sister, Nina, who is still grieving over the death of her fiance. McGee helps her look into the murder and in the process uncovers an intricate embezzlement scheme. He will also help her emotionally (one of the common themes in 1960s era men's fiction is that all a damaged woman needs to get better is the love of a good man, whether Bond or McGee), but he will also run afoul of the embezzlers, putting himself in a truly nasty situation.It's a credit to MacDonald that even though I'd read this book before (albeit twenty years ago) and I knew McGee had to survive (no spoiler here: there are still a lot of books in the series to go), I still found McGee's predicament suspenseful. Then again, it's no surprise: MacDonald is an excellent storyteller. As a result, Nightmare in Pink is another fine entry in one of the all-time great crime fiction series."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"A classic McGee. Which is to say . . .

Mike Gibson had a service injury and Travis did not, and so Travis is willing to leave Florida to go to NYC to see Mike's sister, Nina, who has recently lost her fiance. The fiance, Howard Plummer, was the victim of a mugging-- assailant unknown. Howard had worked for Armister-Hawes, an investment bank. He had complained to others that he had not been able to see Charles Armister to talk with him, and that the bank was undergoing divestment without any strategy evident to make up for the lack of holding a growth portfolio.Travis's former client, Connie Thatcher, informs him that she knows the sister-in-law of Charles Armister, Terry Drummond. He discovers that Terry Drummond hasn't been able to see Charles, either, and she would like to do this to encourage him to return to living with her sister. At the present it seems that Charles is living with his secretary and his lawyer. It is feared that he is somehow under their thumb. Travis McGee certainly does find himself in the midst of a nightmare as he undergoes a stay at a mental hospital where Charles Armister was treated.The plotting of the mystery is very tight, very good."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"Travis McGee lives aboard the Busted Flush, his 52 foot custom houseboat, in Slip F-18, Bahia Mar, Lauderdale.

Nina's fiance, Howard Plummer, was killed in what appears to have been a simple mugging, but then Nina found ten thousand dollars hidden in her apartment. Since Howard worked for Charles McKewn Armister IV, helping to manage his $60 million, Nina fears he may have been skimming money.McGee starts looking around &amp; becomes suspicious when he finds out that Armister had a nervous breakdown recently &amp; has undergone drastic personality changes since then.

MacDonald novel featuring Travis McGee presents our hero as a true \\"Mad Man\\", stuck in the same early 1960s milieu as the classic television series but also under the influence of narcotic subtances. Will he recover? A better question, given he's such a jerk, is who cares?Published in 1964, \\"Nightmare In Pink\\" places McGee in New York City in the midst of its \\"Fun City\\" period. A Korean war buddy asks him to look in on his troubled sister. Travis isn't so preoccupied by her predicament to note her \\"hand-span waist, and the rich swell of goodies above and below.\\"The problem with a book like \\"Nightmare In Pink\\" isn't sexism, or the fact it's horribly dated in parts, or that the first-person tough-guy narration is smug and distancing. I'm primitive enough to overlook such faults. The problem is that the story isn't that good.Nothing in the book comes as a surprise. It's pretty standard even for those whose reading of genre mystery fiction doesn't extend much past the many satires. By Chapter 2, Travis is slapping little sister around, which of course excites her and brings her over to his side. Being a man of standards, he doesn't sleep with her until Chapter 6, and in the process provides her with the best sex of her life. Oh, am I giving too much away?[REAL SPOILERS FOLLOW]The overall story is about a giant embezzlement plot, with McGee's involvement leading to an enforced stay in a mental institution. Though McGee doesn't really solve the case (a third party actually moves in while McGee is still imprisoned) he does manage to kill a few innocent victims. The killing that prompts McGee's involvement in the first place is later revealed to have been a ridiculous coincidence. This makes McGee the only one in the story guilty of killing anyone, though with the excuse given that he was drugged up by his captors at the time.[REAL SPOILERS END]One thing that bothers me here is how easily various characters talk to McGee, despite it being in their best interest not to. Some MacDonald presents as jaded outsiders, which works okay. Other times, he gets what he's after by getting someone drunk, which never works in real life. People can't remember where they parked their car when drunk in real life, or even if they actually were driving a car in the first place, but in this book they are able to expound on their employer's sexual history without any sense of restraint.There's even a clich&eacute;d revelation scene: \\"I wouldn't be telling you this if there was the slightest possible chance of you telling anyone else...So, if you care to ask questions?\\"Why do bad guys do this? Why not just kill their would-be victim? Especially if the would-be victim might wind up killing more people than you ever planned on? \\"Nightmare In Pink\\" is a lame and callous genre exercise dated from its inception, lacking even the craft of a novel that excites a sense of nostalgic recognition today.

Macdonald is one of the earlier entries in the Travis McGee series.What is this book about? That question can be answered in one word. Women. More specifically, the women of New York. MacDonald is not shy when it comes to offering up opinions. And in Nightmare in Pink, a number of detailed and often whithering descriptions of various types of females who inhabit The Big Apple are given. These characterizations are accomplished through both the shockingly blunt introspection of Travis McGee and the self-revealing lines of dialogue MacDonald has provided the women in question. From the young career woman to the society matron to the man-eating baracuda to the high priced call girl, the author takes no prisoners when it comes to describing the mostly, though not entirely, unflattering mindsets that make each one who they are.Whether these sterotypic characterizations are accurate or not is almost irrelevant. The fact of the matter is that this is what McGee and MacDonald seem to believe and the novel is highly effective in presenting these beliefs to the reader.Oh yes, there's also a crime to be solved, the details of which are rather sketchy. Something about a conspiracy to embezzle millions from a moneyed family's Manhattan based foundation. And two thirds of the way through the narrative, Nightmare in Pink turns into a work of science fiction with McGee being kidnapped and force fed mind altering drugs in a hellish mental ward.This novel is far from perfect but one has to admire the audaciousness with which it was written. In creating Nightmare in Pink, Macdonald unapologetically pulled no punches in describing the female characters and fearlessly defied convention by combining genres.

DEEP BLUE GOOD-BY was a good, taught, lean -- if imperfect -- thriller. It was intruing enough, and McGee & his setting seemed to hold enough potential, that I was fired up to read NIGHTMARE IN PINK, thinking that the series, like many another recurring-hero series, would actually improve in sequence due to the author getting more and more comfortable with the character, setting, & style. Unfortunately, this book let me down.First, it was set in New York City, which, while not neccessarily a bad thing in and of itself, does detract from a lot of the attractiveness of the McGee series -- to me, a big part of the selling point is that in other McGee books, the setting is South Florida (where I was born & raised) in the mid-1960s (over a decade before I was born.) New York seemed a much more generic setting -- I mean, how many books (and movies!) are set there? It's been covered already!Also, the dialogue -- something I had a problem with in DEEP BLUE was that the dialogue seemed to be dated, even by the standards of four decades ago (I'm basing this on having read a lot of books & seen a lot of movies from back then.) The dialogue reads like 1930s and '40s movies, when the actors still hadn't yet realized that they were no longer on stage and so could talk more like normal people. Some of the dialogue is outright caricature. (How many times in one conversation can a character start and/or end a sentence with the word \\"Darling\\" before it starts to get annoying?) It's like MacDonald was trying to write hip dialogue and ended up with dialogue that WAS hip -- when he was a young man, ie before World War II.The McGee series does, however, have enough of a good reputation that I'll assume this one is just a lemon that MacDonald, like all good writers, produce from time to time, and I'll at least give book #3 a chance to redeem the series for me."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"The Travis McGee series is the best I have ever read and the only books I have been willing to read again.

He might seem a little like Jack Reacher in Lee Child's novels, except that McGee has a home base at a Florida marina.It is worth reading the series if you have not done so, or rereading if you want to go back to an old friend."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"I like the way the author tells us about his alter ego, Travis McGee. Here is a man taking his retirement while he is young and more able to enjoy it. Every once in a while he has to go to work to support his habits. He finds someone who has been taken advantage by the villan. McGee will get back what every he can and then takes a 50% split of the retrieved goods or money. The story of how he won his house boat and how it get its name was interesting too. Every once in a while, the author will go off and vent his frustrations about some change in American mores. It makes an interesting read, particularly when you consider these books were written forty to fifty years ago."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK is John D. MacDonald's second book in the Travis McGee series. This book came out in 1964 but shows little age. Being in New York instead of Ft. Lauderdale isn't as exciting but the dialogue is crisp and witty and this second book helps us get to know McGee. As always, read the series books in order. Great character and wonderful classic series. Very Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"Even though I truly enjoy the Travis McGee series this was the only one that I feel is not up to the standard of entertainment as the others. It wasn't as riviting and many times I just wanted to skip to the end. This is the only one in the series that I think should be avoided."},{"Title":"NIGHTMARE IN PINK (TRAVIS MCGEE)","review":"I once dated a guy who was always quoting Travis McGee. It's not often that a genre fiction hero is a source of quotes. But it is the philosophical aspect of McGee that keeps this series from being a totally dated antiquity. Travis loves women. Travis is a chauvanist, but a thoughtful one. This is only my second McGee novel (trying to read them in order) but I find myself most entertained by his musings on women, loyalty to friends, work and - in this book - the role of New York in the downfall of humanity.The plot is described only too well in other reviews. Suffice it to say that most of the action takes place in the third quarter of the book with a medical scenario that would make Robin Cook proud. It's all a bit far-fetched but the pages turn easily enough. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars overall if the system allowed."},{"Title":"Musician from the Darkness","review":"Beautiful pictures, but the storyis a bit weak and perhaps toopolitically correct. Not a bad book,though."},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"Lighthearted and heartwarming. Everyone needs some fluff reading on their bookshelves. I love this series (&quot;A Perfect Love&quot; is definately the weakest however) and this book, &quot;Hearts at Home&quot;, is wonderful. I liked the turn of events for Annie and Edith had some downright hilarious moments. We spent a bit too much time &quot;on the other side&quot; with Olympia perhaps but I was no worse for the wear. I can always count on these books to fill me up and leave me a better person. Thank you authors Copeland and Hunt and please hurry with the next one."},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"I just received my copy of Hearts at Home late yesterday in the mail, began it last night and just finished it already (boo hoo hoo!)! I have thoroughly enjoyed this series of stories about Heavenly Daze.I cannot quite explain it, but when I read these books, I felt calm and relaxed, which is something I don't feel often. Often, I am anxious and worried, but these stories have an overwhelming power of relaxation and healing over me. Simply put, they make me smile and sometimes choke up and sometimes I laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"I found this series of books by Lori Copeland to be so much fun and entertaining, that I could hardly wait to read them all.

A must read!!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"I have enjoyed each book in the Heavenly Daze series, but I absolutely howled at Edith's weight loss dilemma. There is a minute amount of women on earth who do NOT fight the battle of the bulge, but like most of us, there are 5 to 10 pounds now and then that challenge us to yield to self-control. And that challenge can become absolutely hysterical in hindsight. I maintain God has a flat forehead from smacking it so many times over the many ways we mortals try our &quot;quick fixes&quot;.You have us on the edge of our seats eagerly anticipating the next month in the lives of these blessedly imperfect people. The message of God's intimate participation in each person's life comes across so beautifully in this series without being &quot;preachy&quot;, and we your readers take great delight in that.The people in this series feel like &quot;kin&quot;, like I personally know them and have known them all my life."},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"This series has really just grown on me. I love these characters and their small town island charm. I loved reading about Annie and Dr. Marc....totally wasn't even expecting their romance so was kind of surprised but then I just loved reading about them. I can't wait to read about their &quot;courtship&quot; in then next book. I also thought Edith's struggle with her weight was what a lot of women end up doing. The way the authors dealt with that issue was very well done. We have to trust God in every area of our life...including our appetite. I started rereading certain parts of the book right away....excellent book!"},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"These books are wonderful .I couldn't put them down and will read them again ..

I couldn't help analyzing which part Lori Copeland wrote and which part Angela Hunt wrote (I suspect all the afterlife/angel parts!) Edith's diet story got very old, and I found it funny that the dream about taking care of her body was obviously penned by the same author who wrote Dr. Jonah's lecture to Jacquelyn about eating a variety of all foods for her body in A Time to Mend. That said, \\"The Heavenly Daze Series\\" is a very appropriate series title - if you're after a light, fluffy read."},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"This is a light, easy to read book, you can read for enjoyment and amusement. No bad stuff here--only real life softened with sugar."},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"I just finshed Hearts at Home and have just one question: WHEN WILL THE NEXT BOOK BE READY?! I can't wait for it. I am really beginning to wonder if the authors have a spy camera in my house. Edith's dieting sounds just like mine! I love seeing Dr. Marc and Annie together. Mourned the loss of Olympia and cried while I read about the wedding."},{"Title":"Hearts At Home (Heavenly Daze Series)","review":"I loved this series...until this book. It felt rushed and unbelievable.For example: The thirty something Annie falls for the sixty something doctor after having already dated the doctor's son. Not only does she fall for him, but she blurts out her intentions and all is well between them. Huh?The characters lost the qualities I loved so much in them. It began to feel like a soap opera....only worse.I'm sorry, but this book really fell short. I wish the author's had a chance to do it over."},{"Title":"Child Across the Sky","review":"Okay, maybe I'm being picky because I'm on this Jonathan Carroll streak right now and just finished four of his other books before this one. Like his great books, this one has brilliant scenes, concepts and wild plot devices, but I found that it didn't hold together as well as his others. At times, it seems like even Carroll might have lost one of his own threads. This book made me appreciate how great his new one, Marriage of Sticks, is. If you haven't read anything by Carroll before, I'd stick to his others first. If you're a Carroll freak like I am, you'll want to search this one out. Rondua appears in this one too and you may recognize Finky-Linky and some of the usual suspects."},{"Title":"Child Across the Sky","review":"I agree with the previous review, that this isn't the best book with which to acquaint yourself with Carroll. THE LAND OF LAUGHS might be the best place to start - or try his last book, THE WOODEN SEA. Truth be told, A CHILD ACROSS THE SKY falls far short of his other works. Its highlights are two short stories, both of which can be found in his terrific collection, THE PANIC HAND. The plotting of CHILD feels rushed and forced, and its themes slightly convoluted. Carroll's distinctive voice is very much present - and as always a pleasure to listen to. This just didn't hit the mark like so many of his others."},{"Title":"Child Across the Sky","review":"Jonathan Carroll is the most consistent writer working today. With each novel he writes, he breaks new ground and always manages to create something compelling and gorgeous. All his books are massively beautiful works of art, each telling a story that screams to be heard. If you enjoy literature that doesn't restrict itself to solely entertainment--though is certainly not lacking in, but that also dares to challenge the mind--then do yourself a favor and read Jonathan Carroll."},{"Title":"Child Across the Sky","review":"For some reason I wasn't able to sink fully into the world of Jonathan Carroll like I usually can...but here were a few lovely quotes:\\"Whatever, it took an hour of hard walking in the blue lead cold of a New York December for me to really hold in the palm of my mind the fact my best and oldest friend was dead.\\"And speaking of being dead...\\"There is a life review, of course, but it was so much more interesting than I had ever imagined. For one thing, they show you how and where your life really happened. Things you didn't experience or weren't ever aware of, but which dyed the fabric of your life its final color.\\"And as always, his take on life speaks right to mine: \\"What more American tradition is there than the turnpike rest stop? I don't mean those Mom and Pop pretty-good-food one-shot places somewhere off the interstate that sell homemade pralines. I'm talking about a quarter-mile lean on the steering wheel that curves you into the parking lot the size of a parade ground, fourteen gas tanks, toilets galore and Muzak. The food can be pretty good or pretty bad, but it's the high torque ambiance of the places that make them so interesting, the fact that no one is really there - only appetites or bladders, while eyes stare longingly out the window at the traffic.\\"Only appetites or bladders, indeed.And I think I will end with this, because Carroll has a way, in nearly every book, at getting the reader to examine his or her own life as the characters do...looking back over the small pieces and huge events that shape who we are. The huge events are easy to remember, but sometimes it's the small pieces that give life its flavor.\\"No matter how old or jaded you are there will always be something exciting and cool about cruising around at three in the morning with a bunch of good friends. All the old duds are asleep but you're still awake, the windows are down, the radio's glowing green and playing great music. Life's given you a few extra hours to horse around. If you don't grab them, they aren't usually offered again for a while.\\"See? So I honestly don't know why I couldn't sink into his words, his world. He creates characters that life the truest of lives in the most fantastical of circumstances. I can't point to anything in particular that caused my interest to wander.I love Jonathan Carroll and his books...and I look forward to my next trip to his world."},{"Title":"The Age of Conversation","review":"The description on the synopsis of the book provided by the \\"Book reviews\\" is fairly accurate. Therefore, I will only point out that the book is no very engaging, but it is not dry either. It can be savoured by the professional historian, and by the educated layperson too. Therefore, my rating is 5 (content) and 3/4 (pleasure). In addition to this work, other books that I would recommend reading would be 1) \\"Nobilities in Transition 1550-1700 : Courtiers and Rebels in Britain and Europe\\" by Ronald G. Asch; 2 and 3)\\"Myths of Power. Norbert Elias and the Early Modern European Court \\" and \\"Vienna and Versailles : The Courts of Europe's Dynastic Rivals, 1550-1780 (New Studies in European History)\\" by Jeroen Duindam (whose books present a more accurate view of monarchy, nobility, the court and the state contrary to that provided by Elias's \\"The Court Society\\"); and 4) \\"The Pleasures of the Imagination: English Culture in the Eighteenth Century\\" by John Brewer."},{"Title":"The Age of Conversation","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this hundred year plus survey of women who influenced French culture and the world through their skillful handling of men of letters and men of power. It is well-written, not ponderous or academic like many histories. Anyone who is interested in France, nobility, women's history, or the art of living well will find this an intriguing look into the beautiful drawing rooms of Paris. I can think of several friends to whom I would recommend this book. Truly satisfying."},{"Title":"The Age of Conversation","review":"This is an excellent study of the salon movement in France during the 17th and 18th centuries. It is both scholarly and readable. After many years of reading about this phenomenon during the Enlightenment, I feel that I have begun to understand how it came to be and why it was so important. Ms Craveri has put the intellectual contributions of women in the 17th and 18th centuries into a comprehensible context. I especially enjoyed the citations from primary sources which give texture to her work."},{"Title":"The Age of Conversation","review":"A very detailed study about how some women in the XVIII century France became leading \\"locomotives\\" in society, dictating the ways people shoud behave, talk and even think. It's interesting but a little too long and too detailed."},{"Title":"Street Children: A Guide to Effective Ministry","review":"This handbook is uniquely designed to orient workers among street children. Examples are given from every continent and many cities that reveal the nature and extent of this global crisis. Several authors explain who street children are, where they can be found, why they are on the streets and the nature of their trauma. &quot;Street Children&quot; also gives a profile of the street worker, examines bonding issues, explains the cycle of addiction to the streets and more. Anyone working in urban mission or with forgotten children will be motivated by this volume and in the process become better equipped to face the challenge of this complex ministry."},{"Title":"The poetical works of John Keats,","review":"I have the 1970 paperback version of the Oxford University Press \\"Keats Poetical Works\\" edited by H. W. Garrod in 1956. As I began to read longer poems like Endymion, I found the small font size distracting. Also, Garrod's commentary and footnotes are rather limited. I rate this Oxford edition as only three stars as better editions are readily available.You might consider Selected Poetry (Oxford Poetry Library, 1996 and 2000 editions) that is edited by Elizabeth Cook. To confuse matters a bit, there is now a 2001 version, also edited by Elizabeth Cook, with a different title: John Keats: The Major Works (Oxford World's Classics). These newer versions may contain more extensive commentary and footnotes than the earlier Garrod edition.I do have recommendations for two books with which I am quite familiar.The first is Complete Poems and Selected Letters of John Keats, published by Modern Library Paperback Classics in 2001. It contains an excellent introduction by Edward Hirsh and good footnotes by John Pollock. Five stars.My other recommendation is The Complete Poems, Penguin Classics, edited by John Bernard. This Penguin Classics edition has been a standard Keats text for several years. Five stars."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"Max Born was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, a great physicist and a cultivated gentleman. His &quot;Atomic Physics&quot; has been around since a long time, but is still the best place to find out why do we really need to replace Newtonian mechanics. This book studies every kind of phenomena which puzzled the physicsts of the early century, like thermal equilibrium of radiation, photo-electric effect, the Bohr model of the atom, specific-heat irregularities, cohesion forces among molecules, etc. Then he shows how quantum mechanics correctly describes each one of them. This is done in a pedagogically very effective way: the ideas are explained in the text, while the more formal derivations appear in a large set of appendices. These are gems of precision and concision, precious by themselves. My favorite one is the derivation of the Van der Waals forces (between molecules), which he shows to be essentially quantal, as they are due to the zero-point energy of the ! quantum harmonic oscillator. One of the great text-books of this century."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"Atomic Physics is based upon a series of lectures on physics that Born gave in Germany in 1933. Since then it has been translated into English updated significantly as physics developed. This means that the book represents sound physics, and not the relatively undeveloped 1933 picture of the physics.I should note that the title of the book is slightly misleading. The original German edition was called modern physics. However, the publisher of the English version already had a book called modern physics, so the English version was renamed Atomic Physics.Born covers a wide range of topics dealing with the gasses, elementary particles, the structure of the nucleus, atoms, molecules. He has written the book in the context of describing the historical development of each topic. This is done in a flowing style by only including important equations in the text. Derivations and so fourth are placed in the 130 pages of appendices in the back of the book. This allows the text to tell a story without the burden of constant discontinuities due to equations. If you want to see the maths, just flip to the back of the book.I would classify this book somewhere between popular science and a textbook. Like a popular science it tells a story, it flows and readable. People with some knowledge of physics can read this book and learn a lot form it. Even without the appendices. On the other hand, like a text it doesn't give hand wavy, simplified descriptions of the physics. This is good hard physics.While I wouldn't call this book a text, it is far too general for that, it does give an excellent overview of the development and character of modern physics from one of the people who was there in the thick of it. I highly recommend it to any person that is acquainted with physics. Non-scientists would probably benefit more from reading something like Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.This is a great book, it is well written, structure and relevant. It fully deserves five stars. To reiterate what other reviewers have said, I wish present-day textbooks were written this well."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"When we see how much quantum mechanics pushed our civilization and how bad it became explained on 'modern' textbooks it is a relief to find out that this book is still published and affordable. A must for anyone interested in the subject or needing to understand it with the help of one of the fathers of QM."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"I used this book many years ago to prepare for my preliminary exams (pre-PhD exams) in modern physics. Although it's dated (ca. 1950), that doesn't matter very much. The strong feature is that it discusses the content without getting into a lot of formalism, and gives the historical connection between different aspects that one is not likely to see in the usual text books."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"Well, this is probably not the most up to date text but it is still one of the best. The book is a collection of topics (Atomic Physics, Solid State Physics, some of QM, some of classical Physics, Statistical Thermodynamics), which are explained in a short, simple and clear way. This is also a great book for those who are familiar with QM: they will find an excellent collection of topics that are just outlined on other standard QM textbooks. Moreover one can learn a lot from the original way M. Born approaches important subjects in Physics (how to recognize the Physics in every concept, for example). This is a book everyone interested in Physics should have in her/his library."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"This book on Atomic Physics is in its eighth printing for good reason. Its a five star book and I have evaluated against a college level, more detailed equivalent.

It will become your Bible. PS: I am retired and seventy+. CFC"},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"This is a wonderful book to read if you have an advanced degree in math and physics. The latter is needed to understand it completely. It's probably also a wonderful book to read even if you don't have an advanced degree in math and physics, for it does actually penetrate the equations and reveal the physics hidden within them. It is telling of the calculus-centric view of its era, that the author uses Fourier transforms, separation methods for PDEs, perturbation theory, and other advanced analysis tools, without flinching, but shies away from simple algebraic methods as being 'mathematically too advanced.'"},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"I know this book from my student days and found it to be an outstanding primer on atomic physics. While it is generally more advanced than my 14 yr old grandson can fully understand, there is enough here that gives him a basic grasp of the model and a foundation on which he can build."},{"Title":"The Minimal Self: Psychic Survival in Troubled Times","review":"Lasch has a great intellect: he's read deeply and though he's strong-minded, he's also compassionate. Here he examines faulty ideas, often finding the grain of truth that's given them wing. In THE MINIMAL SELF, still deeply relevant to our times, he explains two urges in light of man's destructiveness and our lack of faith in a future: a regressive, narcissistic wish to merge with the environment, in a timeless solipsism that negates the past and the present; or else, a strict adherence to rules and regulations that demand obedience by threat of punishment and retribution, and which harken back to false nostalgia for a simpler past.Lasch shows us that it's much more complicated than that: that our obsession with survival, our lack of faith in language to communicate commonalities (and its exploitation not just by the media but by activists trying to counter the media's insidious influence), and our confusion about how to structure, or de-structure (destroy) our lives leads us back to Freud, back to humility, and back to separation, away from narcissistic fantasies of either merger or omnipotence.In brilliant, thoughtful, complex prose, Lasch argues for an enlightened dependence, a reliance on the cultural sphere to give meaning to our inner drives and our recognition of the objective outside world, and thoughtfulness and sobriety in place of infantilism and fantasy. Lasch argues for mature play, and his is a convincing argument."},{"Title":"The Minimal Self: Psychic Survival in Troubled Times","review":"The book is disturbing and insightful. Though written in the 80s, this social/psychological/political/aesthetic critique describes today's disconnect between self and society: the lack of humanisitic glue; the sad (and secret) nihilism of religions that can no longer keep the genie of destruction corked up; the merging of mass culture with mass destruction. Just as it must've been two decades ago, the book is an amazing wake up call. My copy, however, was in poor shape. The binding is upside down and the pages are falling out."},{"Title":"The Minimal Self: Psychic Survival in Troubled Times","review":"This book written back the middle of the 1980s is another one of a series of pessimistic,broad-reaching cultural studies written by Christopher Lasch. It is a follow-up to the more well known and influential work &quot;The Culture of Narcissism&quot;.Mr. Lasch describes the emptiness and bleakness that he sees as a hallmark feature of the arts, of politics and society in thelate 20th century. Although one could disagree with his opinions, I think that this a well written indictment of modern times."},{"Title":"Forbidden Dance, Book 1","review":"Forbidden Dance, orginally published as \\"Tenshi no Kisu\\"(Angel's Kiss) in Japanese, is more than your typical shoujo manga. The book focuses on ballet dancing, but you don't actually have to like ballet to enjoy this series. The story has a very good balance of love and drama, and focuses on themes other than first love, such as jealousy, rivalry, and working toward your dreams. The artwork is a little different from what most readers are probably used to. I would compare it to Kare Kano, only a bit more simplistic. However, the story more than overcompensates for the simplicity of the artwork. This is a title that is impossible to put down and will leave you wanting more. I have read the first three volumes of this series (there are only 4 in all) and would recommend it to all fans of shoujo manga, and everyone else who enjoys a good drama."},{"Title":"Forbidden Dance, Book 1","review":"Truly I don't know why I picked up this manga; it was about a ballet dancer, which no offense to those who take the dance, is not that interesting of a topic in my opinion. But once you start, you really can't put this one down. The storyline is very interesting, and the surprise ending threw me for a loop, but in a good way. As for the art, it's decent enough, except I have some qualms about disaportionate bodies; sometimes it looks like they have huge thighs with uber tiny lower legs. If you look past these discrepancies, I'm sure this will be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Jesse Owens (Black American Series)","review":"Jesse Owens was born in 1913 in Alabama.His mother and father or as they were sharecroppers.Jesse or as they called him \\"JC\\" was the youngest of his family.He was small and skinney. \\"JC\\" had a sickniss in his leg that his mother had to take out with a hot kichen knife.He calls that leg his lucky leg.In the 1920's the owens moved to Cleveland's black ghetto where he went to high school.

His autobiography differs in the details--such as whether or not he got married before or after his first child was born, and also speculates about his opinions. It is opinionated in itself and doesn't give as objective a viewpoint as I would desire in a biography. However, the photographs are great, and let the viewer become acquainted with what the real Jesse Owens looked like, for those who were not acquainted with him while he lived. Not bad, but I don't recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"Jesse Owens (Black American Series)","review":"Jesse Owens' autobiography was written as something of a self-advertisement.

But if you have read MarketWizard by Schwager, none of those traders were alike. They traded with their own style, with their own risk tolerance, and most importantly with their own goals.That's why Williams' information should be used solely as a base for your own trade development and not as the gospel. Because of the few things mentioned above, and many other personal traits that individual traders bring to the trading experience, there are no \\"futures gurus\\" that can tell you exactly how to trade day to day.So you have to decide for yourself what is most important being told how to trade or discovering how to trade for yourself.

Maybe I was expecting too much. Larry provides a great introduction to key ideas like premiums, open interest, and oscillators but sadly leaves the reader dangling. Much of the reading is more philosophical than scientific. For $50 dollars I expect details, not generalization. For example, Larry mentions that a change in open interest of 25% or more greatly excites him. A change over what time period? A day, week, what? To be fair, I'm very sure Mr. Williams is an excellent commodity speculator and very intelligent person.

I bought this book years ago and the things I learned then I am still using today. And now that we are in a bull market for commodities I think anyone reading this book will be able to put the lessons in this book to some good use. The book is easy to read and shows some charts and graphs so anyone can follow along and understand. Commercials and Open Interest are two very big factors in picking successful low risk entry points and this book tells you how to use them. Larry Williams is a trading pro and I have read most of his books. Most are good but this one I think is the best. It is not for system traders but more for trend followers or discretionary traders. The other thing it doesn't take a computer to trade this stuff, although I would recomend it. It is subjective but it does work. There are no tests that show you what percentage of trades will work because this is more of an intuitive type of trade that can be learned and applied with accuracy.

Does Paul Tudor Jones sell &quot;how to trade&quot; courses? No, he is busy making money. Do any great traders sell courses or send mass mailings? Methinks not. This book like all Larry Williams books smack of ignorance about the reality of what works and does not work in the marketplace. I am a winning trader and I can assure you that 95% of what you read will not be worth your time. I am doubtful that this review will even be published but if it is I will be happy if just one person benefits from it."},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"A lot of the books on the bookshelves don't belong there-- some belong in your homes others the trash. This one is really bad. Larry Williams is a direct marketer not a trader. If you want to learn how to trade read Market Wizards, or Trade Your way to Financial Freedom, or how I made two million in the stock market-by Krubel which tells how he first lost money very badly and learned from his mistakes. Larry is a gambler, not a trader. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"Larry still teaches most of this material at his current seminars. He has refined the technique a bit and added a couple of new technical indicators, but his fundamental approach is the same. His &quot;million dollar tools&quot; are extremely useful for position trading and anyone who has the patience and discipline to take a little time and test the relationships outlined in this book should prosper. The relationships discussed in his book have stood the test of time and are among the most consistently profitable to this day."},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"The book is all right, although I had more expectations. The information intensity is not high. It s a simple book and also not that much pages. So if you read it with a lot of expectations you won't be satisfied. Especially the begining is very very simple but after you read the half of the book, in my opinion, it gets interesting because then you get a couple of odd information which you won't be expecting, and you get also very good and simple but profound psychological info that you may use to succeed in your way in the commodity/stock market.Further, the fact that the book and the information in it is so easy and simple in combination with the fact that the author is one of the experts give a good feeling about making money in commodity/stock market. So it makes you believe that making money is actually about having a simple but solid plan and following your plan (plan your trade and trade your plan).Personally,I think, that the book is relatively expensive, for the content. Actually all of the books of the author mr. Larry R. Williams, are relatively expensive, and because of that, although I always buy more books of an author, I won't buy another book of mr. Williams.Although nowadays a million is not that much, compare to 70's when the author has made that much money, the title will still attract people. But if you buy it to see how the process of making that much money was going, you would be disappointed because the author doesn't talk about it, for that you should buy the classic book of Nicolas Darvas, How I made 2,000,000 $ in the stock market, and his another book, \\"you can still make it in the market\\".As a matter of fact, I don't know how much money mr. Williams has used to make that million Dollars, because it would be nice to see how he make a 100 000 $, for instance, to a million dollar and not how he make 700 000 to a million, anyway.For trading and trading plans, \\"Diary of a professional commodity trader\\", is what I would prefer and it costs the half of this book.For commodities itself, however, this book \\"How I made one million ..\\"of mr. Williams is okay.For more technical analysis, you should find another books!Best wishes,Houtan"},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"The book is lot more than a technical... It shows you how you can understand the fundamental structure of the market by reading chart.

In all that time I have rarely seen an investment guru as humble as Larry Williams.

Technically and inspirationally this book is a sound buy for today's investor."},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"With out a doubt this is still the best book out there on commodities. The most difficult thing I have is applying open interest, since, if you look at the charts on CME, open interest almost always seems to be increasing. However, the way he applies technical indicators and phases of the moon (that isn't a typo) is very fascinating. If you are going to buy any commodities book, this should be your first.

If you can get past the chapters on lunar cycle correlations and focus in on his study of open interest and trading ranges you will havegained an &quot;edge&quot;&gt;despite the age of the book(1974) I feel it has something valuable to offer trader at all levels. good reading and good luck!"},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"I can't talk about the content yet, but something is wrong with the spacing on this book. Although it doesn't t seem to have any paragraphs missing, there are some extra spacing where only one space should be.The most obvious example is in the chapter where the writer talks about the boats sailing and returning into harbour, with the prices going up, the second part of the story when he talks about the real reason why the sailing boats were back in the harbour, is in a completely new chapter!!!Is this only my book?? or are all of them the same?? Would appreciate if the editors get back to me and re-send a book I will then return the copy I have."},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"I was most successful with simple mutual funds and baskets of mini-futures. I read some of this book, and William's Batting 800, the mother of all manuals supposedly. I kind of feel like it was a waste of $200. I really don't know what to think of Williams, thus the neutral 3-stars. He's the toughest to scrutinize. Ryan Jones apparently thinks he's &quot;scary williams&quot; with his cowboy money management style.I am a Tradestation expert combined with years of programming and trading, passed the Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney screening exams. They should have hired me even without $40 million worth of friends, because I could help a lot of investors avoid a lot of needless stuff.I absolutely hate Ken Robberts, Jake Burnstein, Wade Crook, and Carleton Cheets. I would never trust Robert's character or wisdom; his stuff tests positive for maybe ten percent, forty percent of the time, maybe; But they can all say, hey it works.I deciphered and tested a lot of clever &quot;not a system&quot; hype, which went right back before thirty day. William's stuff seems the most disjointed, tougher to integrate test. He has some unique methodology and it seems to work for him successfully, but his hotline calls on about a half dozen trades scared me clean away. I'm going to integrate test him soon though, somehow, maybe combining COT or AccDis with B and C and D or E, if somebody hasn't.I wasted $2500 on Trade&quot;Hype&quot;station and another $500 on Omni&quot;Clutz&quot;Trader starting out. The thing is, I fully realize now there is no magic indicator, that it's more money management or something else like personal style, but most if not all of these guys needed to shut up a long time ago."},{"Title":"How I Made One Million Dollars Last Year Trading Commodities","review":"Larry Williams is a snake-oil salesman, just like his buddies Jake Bernstein and Ken Roberts.

First, I'll begin with some general praise. This book is worth buying, borrowing, reading at your local library, etc., if for no other reason than the fact that this book, I believe, is the only academic, professional, literary study of minimalism, a much maligned and completely misunderstood movement (even describing it as a movement is kind of troublesome) that swept through literature in the late 70s and on into the early 80s. Yes, you can probably find volumes on Carver, but there's surprisingly little out there (aside from interviews/articles in literary magazines) on Robison and Hempel. A serious examination of Robison and Hempel has been long overdue.Professor Hallett's book provides nice background on literary minimalism's roots. In addition, Hallett does a nice job delineating minimalism from an overall economy of language (i.e. minimalism is not simply spare writing--a confusion too many book reviewers are guilty of spreading). Also, Hallett makes a decent comparison between the minimalists and the post-modernists, aruguing (rightly) that the two sides aren't so far apart.Sure, I have some small concerns with this book. The background material on minimalism itself is more useful than Hallett's discussion of the authors themselves. If you're looking for a thorough examination of Carver, Robison, and Hempel, you're probably best off searching elsewhere. These three writers are sort of glossed over, no single story by any of them receives much treatment, and thus the reader is left with the feeling that he/she is reading synopsis rather than analysis. Of the three writers examined, Hempel probably receives the most (and best) attention. I'm not sure I've been further enlightened about Carver and Robison after reading this book.Still, for those who want an introductory splash into a frequently misunderstood fictional movement, you should begin here."},{"Title":"Radiative Heat Transfer","review":"The book discusses radiation exchange topics, in some detail.It does not discuss the solution of practical radiation heat transfer problems.Examples in the book emphasize reflection, absorption, emission, and scattering,in the various forms that they might occur (as in gases, liquids, and from surfaces).The discussion includes F-factors, and various methods for deriving them.The majority of examples involve parallel planes, or the use of \\"enclosures,\\"typically with a \\"participating medium\\" in between the surfaces.The book shows techniques for deriving expressions for gray behavior and forvarious forms of non-gray behavior, including general spectral behavior.The techniques are spread throughout the book, in different chapters.The reader must pay very close attention to the \\"enclosure\\" context applicablein each specific chapter.Temperature change in a system, due to the effect of energy transfer, andthe thee-dimensional temperature field resulting from such energy transfer,is not the main topic in this book. The classic conservation of energy equationinvolving system change via thermal radiation, convection, and conductionis mentioned a few times [26,282,680]. For practical applications, the authorrefers the reader to \\"applications ... reported in the literature\\" [680].A few examples show how to derive expressions involving heat flux orheat flow rate explicitly [such as 164,166,171,177,213,218-219,282].Many example cases are distinctive for the detail in mathematical exposition,accompanied by numerous supporting references.However, the utility sometimes seems to be disconnected from the real world.For instance, a large number of examples involve parallel planes, or \\"black\\" surfaces.For instance, the non-dimensionalized graphs of convective heat transfer coefficient,and flow over the flat plate [698,699], while properly constructed mathematically,are not representative of professional heat transfer practice in general.For instance, the classic Hollands V-corrugated surface is discussed [107] for reflectivesurfaces, followed by a broad-based discussion for \\"apparent\\" absorptance and emittance [215]on the V-corrugated surface [213]. In the example [214], the author discusses apparent emissivitydue to the geometry, which is indeed correct, but surprisingly, he does not discuss theseminal tradeoff between the \\"flat black\\" surface and the \\"selective surface,\\" as itoccurs in the V-corrugated case, in particular.The author does not seem to understand why heat transfer engineers must, in practice,employ certain analytical methods in a real job environment [276 and 277].The terms \\"of course\\" and \\"obviously\\" occur too many times in the book."},{"Title":"Radiative Heat Transfer","review":"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Radiative Heat Transfer by Michael F.

His lively and insightful writing about music and musicians has not been duplicated or replaced by anyone. That isn't to say there are not good writers on music, there certainly are, but none fill that niche for the general reader that Schonberg filled. It was impossible to read an article by him and not come away with something new to think about or some wonderful anecdote to share.Fortunately, his book \\"The Great Pianists\\" is still in print and should be read by every music lover regardless if they can play the keyboards or not. Why this book is out of print is beyond me. He does pretty much what he did with \\"The Great Pianists\\", he provides articles on great virtuosi, their times, and the other artists of their day. This book is always charming, the writing is delightful, and the articles provide the patented Schonbergian light-touch-teaching. You would have to be a widely read almost beyond understanding to not pick up anything new in this book.You will learn about great violinists, singers, and even the very greatest pianists. There are lots of pictures and drawings to help you put faces to the names. If for nothing else, by reading this book carefully you will always have some interesting story to share at a dinner after a concert or at a party with your musical friends.Since you can pick up used copies of this book so cheaply, I urge you to get a copy and enjoy it.

Scotland deserves better than this book. The only thing I gleaned(sp?) off this book was that this author thinks Scotland is the greatest place on Earth. Avoid this book.

I cannot believe that this is out of print. The combination of war and intrigue, myth and mysticism, music and death, is superb. If you can get a copy, you'll love it.

The author gives us a great view of Finland and details on the war effort with Russia.It is a well-written book that has a difficult to pull off story line (by this I mean to keep it interesting for 350 pages), but the author gets it done.

It works, however, and the novel flows along with a nice blend of music and military history. I don't imagine there are very many World War II novels that deal with the friction between the Soviet Union and Finland so I recommend it for this reason as well. Overall, a great first novel and creative plot development."},{"Title":"Winter Fire: 2","review":"What do you get if you mix Finland, World War II, the composer Sibelius, human frailty, and mythology together? If you are an extremely talented and sensitive writer and you've done your homework thoroughly, you get this novel.I'm going to avoid spoilers in this review, since the strange twists in the plot (twists that seem inevitable after the fact) are so important to it, but here's the basic plot line:Young (a little spoiled) German musician, on the verge of a promising conducting career, is drafted into World War II and winds up in Finland. He eventually meets and becomes friendly with Jean Sibelius the iconic Finnish composer whose music helped define the country's identity. One of the talked-about mysteries of 20th-century music is whether Sibelius ever wrote an Eighth Symphony to finish his output of seven masterpieces and one tone poem that is practically a symphony in scale and shape. Trotter posits that he did and that there are both obvious and hidden reasons why it never reached the outside world.This book takes us into the Finnish (and, briefly, the Russian) fronts of WW II from the German and Finnish points of view, to Sibelius's rustic home in exile, and into the deep [really deep] Finnish forest, the nightmare of war, the consciousness of the Finns, and the far reaches of the human personality under stress.I write about music regularly and was quite impressed with how fluently Trotter makes the musical side of his book into something that a layman can read with understanding and a musician can read with deep appreciation.The book took a while to hook me, but once it did - after about 100 pages - I could scarcely put it down. I think it will haunt me for some time. Certainly, I will never hear the bell part in Sibelius's Fourth Symphony quite the same way again.I have seldom finished a novel thinking \\"Wow, this is a wonderful story\\". That's how I felt when I finished this. I also felt moved and as if I had been on a voyage into a strange and fascinating world.Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Winter Fire: 2","review":"Trotter has magnificent abilities as a writer, and they shine through here in this his first novel, published now thirteen years ago. Notable is his (seemingly) effortless and original facility with language: time and again his unique phrasing captures a landscape or a social setting in an entirely novel way.Secondly, Trotter has a great deal of knowledge about two of the major subjects of this book: music and military history. He has an obvious ability to describe and condense the essence of a piece to his reader, and this can only result from great knowledge and experience in analyzing and interpreting music. Likewise, his extensive knowledge of military history in general and the Finno-Russian war in particular are evident in virtually every paragraph of military description, replete with unusual detail and insight as to the nature of combat and of WWII.But despite all these delicious traits that make the novel so enjoyable, there is a darker side to William Trotter, one that delights in the mystical and even in the horrific, and these, ultimately, made the novel a disappointment for me. What particularly grated was Trotter's mixing of romance with (partial) horror, an aversive experience for someone who, as Trotter describes Tschaikovsky, enjoys a softer (or perhaps more successful) romanticism; not surprising, then, that this novel (spoilers ahead), like Sibelius's Fourth Symphony, contains such bleak despair.Winter Fire can also be read as a defense of mysticism, problematic since in real life mysticism is not as Trotter has portrayed it, but is the irrational, and thus, the violent and inefficacious. It is ironic that Trotter has given the rationalist or skeptical or counterposing role to Erich Ziegler, the Nazi, when in reality the Nazis were just as mystical and irrational as any historical group, with their belief in the blood and Aryan superiority, their myth of the Nordic man and their own Teutonic heritage. THAT TOO is mysticism, not just the superstitions of Finnish country folk. In defense of Trotter some of his prolonged dwelling on the Finnish forests and the feelings they evoke can be justified as a way of describing the origin of musical feeling, and thus the fount of Sibelius's inspiration, and yet Trotter appears to want to do more than this, evidenced by his championing of the shaman and by his portrayal of the otherwise enchanting Kylliki as essentially a mysterious creature. But then I suppose all women are mysterious."},{"Title":"Winter Fire: 2","review":"this is a very well written book if you buy it you will not be disappointed. i'm suprised this is not on the new york times bestseller list.if you buy it you are in for a great read."},{"Title":"Winter Fire: 2","review":"Disclaimer: I'm an old friend and room mate of Mr. Bill and my objectivity is - and should be - suspect from the git-go. But, having said that, I will also say that I have no known level of either loyalty or bribe-ability which would allow me to say a whole bunch of flattering s__t about a work of fiction if I truly thought it was a festering crock of the aforementioned. Having admitted that, I have to give the highest praise I can muster for a work of fiction-cum-biography to this extended, left-handed paen to Jean Sibelius and his quasi-mystical connection with the cultural mythos of Finland and Scandanavian music in general.In the Trotter universe, Sibelius occupies a rune-strewn plane with Odin, Thor, and the rest of the Nordic pantheon and he doesn't make any clear deliniation between their diverse Scandanavian origins, except to set \\"Winter Fire\\" squarely in Finland and give his protagonist an unusual amount of time (for an aggressor's minion engaged in desperate warfare for the survival of his ideology's validity) at liberty in the ghost-ridden forests of rural Finland. Erich Ziegler, a budding symphony conductor in pre-war Germany, is assigned a commander's rank and shuffled off to Finland, where the ghost of his musical muse inhabits the very ground upon which he must fight. Ziegler is keenly aware of this frisson but doesn't appreciate how literal is his connection to the Finnish genius until a chance meeting in the forest draws him, literally, into the orbit of the fabled composer. For anyone whose knowledge of Sibelius and/or Scandanavian classical music runs beyond the cursory, this book offers a delightfully-creepy glimpse into the psyche of Sibelius; a feat made all the more dazzling by virtue of the fact that Trotter was no more personally acquainted with Sibelius than you or me but his characterization of the legendary auteur rings so eerily true that it will probably never occur to you, as it did not to me, that it might not be dead-accurate.Bill Trotter has, and has always had, an uncanny gift for setting a scene in such a way that you awake from the throes of the reading convinced that you were, in some strange way, present for the events. It is one of the highest and most laudatory of gifts that a novelist can possess and Trotter's work drips with it in luxuriant excess. A lady friend of mine in Greece ordered this book on a whim and wound up, a year later, wandering sans proper guides or supervision, in the forests of Finland, searching vainly for the sort of mystical encounter that Erich Ziegler found in the shrouded mists of the Northern pines. THAT'S the power of great writing, folks.If your imagination isn't bound by the mundane and readily plausible, \\"Winter Fire\\" is a book that can kindle such an exploratory romance in you. I urge you to try it."},{"Title":"Winter Fire: 2","review":"WINTER FIRE is an absolute wonder of a book. I've really never read anything quite like it. On the one hand, the author writes authoritatively on the harsh realities of warfare during WWII on the Russo-Finnish border, and yet he envelopes the narrative with a convincing patina of fantasy. I've read other novels that attempted to achieve this with various levels of effectiveness, but no one in my experience has illustrated such a merging of the real and the fantastic as well as Trotter has with this novel.WINTER FIRE has an appeal to the reader of 20th Century history, and for folk who are interested in a good fiction. Trotter's familiarity with the historical figures in the novel, with the details of warfare between the Finns and their Nazi allies against the Soviet Armies, and with the stark beauty of the landscape of this far northern latititude. Trotter makes it all magical and wonderful and frightening.I heartily recommend WINTER FIRE as one of my all-time favorite tales."},{"Title":"Newspaper Layout & Design: A Team Approach","review":"Moen's work is very readable, written in a very clear and precise style.

But we followed every direction (So easy to do and super quick also) and not one of our friends or family have owned or seen a better dog.

The book's methods for training seemed very stupid and I felt foolish doing the \\"Silly Little Rectangle\\", which is the main starting point of the book. Soon, however I found that the training was doing the trick, my little golden pup was learning! The instructions were easy to follow and as a result my now 14 year old white-faced friend has been the best behaved dog I've ever had, or that any of my friends/family have ever seen.

Nothing unusual or particularly interesting in the telling or presentation."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"\\"The Bloody Benders\\" were a small German immigrant family who settled in late 19th century Kansas, opened a grocery store/inn and began murdering rich lodgers and stashing the bodies across the prarie and in a ditch beneath the house.The ringleader appeared to be the young woman who pretended to speak to spirits and who would find out about the visitors who showed up at their inn. If they had money she would position them in the seat where their backs would be to a screen where one of the other 3 family members would bludgeon the visitor, rob him, then take him down to the ditch/basement and cut his throat.They murdered over a dozen innocent people and then fled when they realised they had been found out. They were never caught and people around the country thought they saw various family members at one time or another. It wasn't even determined if they really were family or not.Geary draws and tells the story brilliantly. The pictures of a late 19th century Kansas conjures up a wistful portrait of frontier life with all it's romance and harshness. The Bender's Inn is drawn in detail and shows how cramped conditions were in those days where you bought the land but had to build the house yourself. The artwork reminded me of Crumb but was different enough to say Geary has his own style. The story clips along at a quick pace and is easily read at an enjoyable sitting.Overall, an interesting little history lesson about an obscure but fascinating case brought vividly back to life with Geary's illustrations and brisk storytelling. I've already ordered other books in Geary's series of Victorian murders so that's how much I enjoyed it. Can't wait for more forgotten cases of murderers from the past!"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"I almost didn't order this book for the teen section of the library where I work, and I was honestly surprised at how fantastic it was when it came in.

Black and white drawings illustrate the story of four strange people who use seduction to attract wealthy victims, whom they then kill. Excellent action and high drama mystery lends to a fast-paced graphic novel story hard to put down, and recommended for any general-interest holding strong in graphic novels.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"Geary's graphic documentary \\"Treasury of Victorian Murder\\" series is a guilty pleasure, the sort of thing you almost don't want to admit you enjoy reading. They sometimes range into folklore and myth, but this volume is solidly historical, set in Labette County, Kansas, in the southeastern corner of the state, in 1870-73. It all begins with the arrival of \\"Pa\\" Bender, apparently a German immigrant, with the younger John Bender, apparently his son, who build a frame structure just off the regional business road that was once the Osage Trail. They put up a sign identifying the structure as an inn and grocery, and then their womenfolk arrive -- \\"Ma\\" Bender and the mysteriously attractive Kate. The Bender Inn becomes a regular stop for travelers and they seem to fit right into the neighborhood, with Kate receiving due attention from the local young men, . . . until inquiries begin to come in about individuals known to have traveled on horseback or by wagon through the area who never arrived at their destination, and who nearly always were carrying substantial amounts of cash. Suspicions are aroused among the locals, who come poking around and investigating, and suddenly the Benders are gone, packed up and disappeared themselves. The shovels come out. And then the bodies begin to appear. What happened to the Benders -- assuming that was even their name? Assuming they were even related? Nobody ever found out anything, though there were various claims and gossip. And Geary tells the story in his inimitable, rather creepy black-and-white art. He always reminds me in some way of Edward Gorey, though their styles are nothing alike. Maybe it's the facial expressions. Or maybe it's just the general weirdness of the material. But the books in this series are nearly all worth reading."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"Very interesting story that first caught my attention on the Mysteries at the Museum television show. I was a bit disappointed to discover that this book is really a graphic novel or whatnot, but it was still informative and held my attention."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"I know that I said the Axeman of New Orleans was the best in the series, but I lied! Bloody Benders is by far the best. The illustrations are far more complex and intriguing. The story kept me hooked and strapped to my seat. In all due honesty, I had never heard of the Bloody Benders so some of my excitement could have come from being introduced to the legend. Still, this adaptation of the legend is very intriguing and perfectly fits the mysterious story.In case you're like me and don't know the story, I'll rely it here. In 1870, John Bender Jr. and John Bender Sr. staked their claim in Kansas along the Osage Trail. Within a year, they have built a house, a grocery store and have sent for their family. The parents speak very little english and count on their beautiful daughter, Kate, to help them survive. The family dabbles in spiritualism and holds seances that have the potential to become violent. Yet, it isn't until dead bodies start appearing in nearby towns that the Benders become #1 on the suspect list. That is if only the authorities can find them.I absolutely love the graphics in this book; they're stark and eerie. Though they're in black and white, Geary is able to solicit great emotion and depth. The illustrations are simple, but they're far from being dull or drab. The clean lines and use of black and white (even without any gray) work well with the subject matter and atmosphere of the empty and vulnerable prairie.This one is a bit different because from the rest of the series because the murders are clearly known. Instead, the mystery is where the Bender's fled to and if they will ever be found. Still, like the other issues in the series, it is like watching an episode of unsolved mysteries with a little bit of a history lesson."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"Victorian era crimes have an oddly enduring appeal for folks of every literary taste and political predilection. For liberals, the dark underbellyof that prim and proper age seems to demonstrate the notion that moral repression breeds violence and hypocrisy; for conservatives, the fact thatevil and sin lurked even beneath such a blessedly restrained surface, confirms a view of the world as old as the story of the Garden of Eden.Fans of the great detectives take comfort in the idea that the mysteries of human behavior must yield to reason, science, and rigorousprocedure. Fans of the criminals revel in the impenetrability of the darkest recesses of the human heart and mind. But regardless of your ownpersonal views, there's no gainsaying the hold that Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes and company continue to exert on our imaginations.Illustrator Rick Geary has been tapping into this lurid fascination for over a decade now, and NBM Publishing is reissuing some of the earlierworks in his acclaimed \\"Victorian Murders\\" series, beginning with the first, A Treasury of Victorian Murders. Mr. Geary accompanies threebrief tales of deliciously bloody (or poisonous) mayhem and murder with an introductory section that sets the Victorian stage and provides somebackground on the times and the more famous personages of the day. His black-and-white drawings--which might owe something to EdwardGorey but are nonetheless distinctive and original--provide a winsome, tongue-in-cheek contrast to the horrid events that he relates. As hementions in a 1987 introduction, one of the things that makes the cases so much fun is that even though the society maintained a veneer ofrespectability, it coincided with the rise of mass daily papers, all intent on out-sensationalizing each other. So when such ghoulish crimes didoccur, they gave free reign to the newspapers to engage in the most outrageous speculations about peoples backgrounds and behaviors. Hetakes evident delight in casually dropping such rumors into the midst of the ornate and fusty little sitting rooms and the forbidding courtroomsin which his stories occur. It all makes for a delightfully droll good time.GRADE : B+"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"The Saga of the Bloody Benders by Rick Geary is part of A Treasury of Victorian Murder put out by NBM Comics Lit. Geary has done another bang-up job merging history, murder, and detailed drawings to pull the reader into a time that is often difficult to understand. Without the historic underpinnings the Benders killing spree would seem a bit comical to the jaded readers of today -- as we lock up our cars, our houses, keep aware of our surroundings. Could the Benders do what they did if they existed today? But that would be a different tale -- and you'll want to enjoy the chill horror of this one.The story of the Benders and their place in the history of Labette County, Kansas, along the Osage Trail is one that highlights the dangers faced by the settlers as they began moving west to find a better life for themselves and their families. Without the historic overview of Kansas becoming a state, the demographics of the settlers, and the geographical overview of the Osage Trail -- it would be difficult to understand how the Benders could do what they did for so long before anyone began to even suspect that something wasn't right at the Bender Inn and Grocery.It was 1871 and inquiries were coming to the local officials from relatives, friends, or business associates trying to locate a person known to have traveled along the trail but who had not been heard from after passing through Labette County. Later it was found that the disappearances began shortly after the Bender men, Pa and John Bender Jr., bought land, built a Inn and Grocery at a high point along the trail and sent for the women, Ma and Kate Bender. The Benders kept to themselves -- dour and silent. Kate however was a beauty and fairly outgoing -- setting up a side business telling fortunes. Most thought them eccentric but harmless.What happened to the Benders? How did they manage to kill so many people undetected? Why did it take so many years before anyone even looked closely at the Bender Inn and Grocery? Geary gives you a sense of place and people leading you step by step through the setup and discovery and aftermath of the crimes. The illustrations are such an intrinsic part of the narrative that often you forget that his is a graphically told tale because the flow is so smooth you're drawn into the pages and the story."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Victorian Murder","review":"Warning to other readers!! This book is written as a comic or cartoon book. I didn't know that when I purchased this book. Very disappointed. This style of book seems to be aimed at children but the subject matter is a bit gory for the very young. I wish that the info on this book at made it very clear that it is written as a comic strip. Very inappropriate story for a comic strip. Unreadable!"},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"Just ending the first five months of my own retirement, I bought this book looking for some helpful advice. What I found was an honest, fascinating book about a person going through a life transition and not being afraid to share his experience, warts and all. It is a tremendously helpful book not only for its information but also as a model of great journal writing."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"I recommend you read \\"Taking Retirement: A Beginners Diary,\\" a diary of a personal journey, an examination of values, a search for answers. You can read it to learn about the author's journey; or perhaps, you can read it to share his quest while seeking answers to your own questions, allowing someone who has struggled with this transition to guide you. Let him help you answer your own questions about the role of work in your life and your future as you transition from an identity anchored in job and daily routine to a more unstructured daily life, a new life with an opportunity to spend the time in your own way.You could also read this diary because the stories are entertaining, especially wife Kate's education about washing fresh vegetables while on a trip, or the insight learned from a visit to an ancient scholar's study in the classical Chinese pavilion in Vancouver. Or, you could read it to appreciate the writing, noting the sense of flow, appreciating how the parts fit together smoothly, and the sense of focus, observing the clear unity of the whole. There is a simple understated style in this diary--the words don't shout at you, they don't compel you--\\"notice me,\\" but the writing reflects measured choices, choosing not just what to write but how. The style is not like a translucent window--to be looked through solely for the underlying ideas. It is more like finely cut beveled glass--to be looked at, to be appreciated, to be enjoyed.This diary also tells of the author's love of gardening and his writing. But, truth be told, I believe his real passion is eating. A well-prepared meal, one with the right herbs and spices, the freshest produce, and the right combination of dishes, is an event always noted with relish and joy, documenting the pleasure of eating with friends, the opportunity to share events of the day.\\"Taking Retirement\\" deals a pack of anecdotes and lessons. The diary details a psychological journey and an actual vacation trip. The psychological journey includes an enquiry, or polling, of friends, business contacts, associates, and retirees, soliciting their views of retirement, each offering a range of attitudes and responses about retirement, about leaving work and leaving an identity drawn from that work. The vacation puts distance between the author and the start of his first semester, his first semester as an emeritus professor, a professor without fall classes, without students, without colleagues. Professor Klaus's personal account describes the start of a new life after 35 years of teaching. It records a search for meaning in retirement, a discovery seeking to balance the ship of life, seeking to reconcile conflicts, complete the journey, prepare to move to a new chapter in life."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"If we are healthy and fortunate, most of us end up in retirement. Klaus's book suggests a more proactive attitude (\\"taking retirement\\") which he displays in his daily narrative as he approaches retirement. Too many people are caught by unexpected feelings and disappointments. TAKING RETIREMENT will help many readers to more thoughtfully consider their goals as well as the reality of their expectations. It's cliche, but retirement is not an end but a beginning, and Klaus does a fine job \\"taking retirement\\" as an intriguing and challenging new time of his life."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"Both my wife and I enjoyed Taking Retirement. Although I won't retire for another 25 months I can relate to many of Klaus's fears and concerns and was happy to witness his coming to terms with and embracing retirement.Not recommended for people who use terms like \\"wimps\\" and \\"girly men\\" but it was a blessing for me to read this work at this point in my life."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"How I wish I had begun reading this sooner! I found myself relieved that someone else had experienced things that I was experiencing."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"Anything written by Carl Klaus is worth a purchase; each sentence is carefully constructed and some of his compound/complex sentences are masterful. Besides the fact that the subject matter is rather niche, any serious reader or writer needs to read everything Klause has written and underline the great sentences to be read and savored over and over."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"I have now read this fabulous book four times. Each time I glean something new from it. Not only does Dr. Klaus echo my sentiments about teaching ( I did for 32 years) but I also had the same struggles he so beautifully describes on paper. His thoughts are extremely honest and he is so candid about his own shortcomings. I do see the influence of E.B. White in his work too- they both went to Cornell and Dr. Klaus would be the first to say how much he admires White.The book also documents his frequent meals at home and they sound so delicious that I wrote down a few of his ideas (for steamed cauliflower and marinated steak).All of his books are worth reading but I would say this is the one that has really helped me to come to grips with my thoughts about hanging up my spurs. It was recommended to us at a retirement workshop by a former Ithaca College professor and I'm glad he mentioned it. He had three others books on a reading list but Dr. Klaus' s book overshadows them all. Buy it and enjoy it!Other reviews have mentioned how \\"self-absorbed\\" he seems but to me that's the great strength of the book- his brutal honesty."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"I looked forward to reading this book but was a bit disappointed in reading it. I wanted very much to like the author and his take on the retirement process, but it seemed like he dithered and fussed so much over the \\"should I or shouldn't I\\" and \\"do I really want to do this\\" struggle in his own mind, that it began to wear thin, to seem redundant. He also seemed peevish and indecisive about the issue of keeping an office at the university as an emeritus prof. And his financial situation was also picked over a bit too thoroughly, until a certain air of smugness seemed to prevail, with numerous references to his very comfortable pension and health benefits through TIAA-CREF, as well as to what sounded like a very luxurious life style, with gourmand tastes and fine wines often cited, lunches in fine restaurants. Then there is the vacation trip he takes with his wife soon after his retirement takes effect. Lotsa money involved, or so it seemed. Finally Klaus seemed to come across as a little too self-involved, too \\"all-about-me-ish,\\" something even his wife commented on, as she apparently reads his various entries in the journal. Not that he really changed his ways.Klaus writes well - no surprise as he taught English at Iowa for decades. I just kept wishing there'd been a bit more personal stuff here, that it had been more of a memoir. But maybe I wouldn't have wished for that if I had read his previous two books, which I haven't. I suspect there may be more of his life in those books. Klaus is obviously an avid gardener, which he apparently wrote at length about in his other books. Having a \\"brown thumb\\" and little interest in gardening, I'm not sure I'd want to read the earlier books.The truth is, this is probably a painfully honest and accurate account of the very things one does consider upon retiring from a long and cherished career. I keep a daily journal myself, and I'm sure I would come across as small-minded and peevish when I write of certain things. It's the nature of a journal/diary - it's \\"private.\\" I liked that Klaus is a Doris Grumbach fan. Me too. I wish he would have talked a little more about books. I mean he is - or was - and English teacher. He must have liked books, right? Oh, well ... My late father, a dedicated gardener his whole life, would probably have enjoyed his thoughts on plants, gardening and food.You can probably tell my feelings are very mixed on this book. I liked it sometimes - when I was not liking it. So let's say 3 and half stars, okay?

I found it useful even many years ahead of retirement. The author's diary style and his description of very mundane conversations and small incidents and how he felt about it makes for a very credible revealing of how this life transition may go for others."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"The author begins recording the events of his upcoming retirement on a regular, almost daily basis. I wanted to read this book because of my interest in the effect of retirement on a person who had been in academia and also to observe what I knew was the author's notable writing skills. I was not disappointed on either count. The rhythmic style of his writing was not obvious, which made it all the more impressive to me and this was what I was expressly looking for. The book is over ten years old, so I knew as I was reading it that Kate, the author's wife, died suddenly a few years after the period this book covers. This made it all the more poignant."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"I've been to two week-long workshops at the University of Iowa and found them extremely useful and well organized. Thus, I was disappointed in Klaus, who played an important role in the writing program at UI, because his book Taking Retirement leaves much to be desired. He is far too concerned about his own fear of retirement. If he had some suggestions for those who fear retirement, the book would be more helpful. I found it tedious, maybe because I've been retired for a while. Never did I read anyone's work who felt so sorry for himself. I wanted to tell Klaus to &quot;get a life&quot; as the younger generation says."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"The author was much to self-absorbed. I gave it up half-way through."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"It is difficult to credit that Mr. Klaus spent his entire career teaching non-fiction writing, given that this book is so poorly written. Surely he should know that the purpose of a published journal is not to record boring details, but to enlighten, entertain or inspire the reader. Sadly, \\"Taking Retirement\\" completely fails at this task. It's chock-full of factual minutia (do we REALLY need detailed accounts of the menus of every meal he eats?), and utterly devoid of insight.One thinks of the scene in \\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles\\", in which a frustrated Neal Page (Steve Martin) tells the oh-so-boring Del Griffith (John Candy): \\"You know... you know when you're telling these little stories? Here's a good idea: have a point. It makes it so much more interesting for the listener!\\"."},{"Title":"Taking Retirement: a Beginner's Diary","review":"I wanted to like this book very much, but after the first 50 pages I began to identify with the author's wife who encouraged him to quit ruminating on the loss of his title, his students, his office, etc. He visits friends and relatives in nursing homes to make himself even more melancholy about the future, frets over the variables of his investments and gives his co-workers a hard time over having a party to commemorate his career. I was hoping this would be a helpful &quot;How To&quot;, but I found it to be a definite &quot;How Not To&quot;."},{"Title":"Flashbacks: Prisoner of War in the Philippines","review":"The author, Walter Middleton, was a good friend of my dad's when I was a kid. At about age 10, full of the idea that war is really grand (common among red-blooded males of that age and beyond, it seems), I started bugging Mr. Middleton with questions like, &quot;What did you do in the War?&quot; About the third time I asked, he set me down for about an hour and told me. What I heard changed me forever.Many of the things Mr. Middleton told me that day are stories included in this book. I warn you, it is un-PC by standards of the current decade, but the author is to be forgiven if four years of treatment as an animal, by animals, has colored his view of the Japanese as a people. Also, the text is rife with colloquialisms, and there are more than a few grammatical and spelling errors. But the intent was not to write a thesis here. It was to record for succeeding generations the unique perspective of the War, the Japanese captors, and our own officers (including the great MacArthur) from the eyes of our enlisted men, who bore the brunt of the War. In this aim, Mr. Middleton succeeds with five stars. For anyone who has never read an alternative history textbook, I rank &quot;Flashbacks&quot; equal to Howard Zinn's &quot;A People's History of the U.S.&quot; and James Loewen's &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; in importance.I have ordered a copy of this book for a friend of mine with whom I have had conversations about how most Americans of my generation have no idea what hard times are really like. (I know I don't, not from first-hand experience such as recorded in this book.) I would have sent my own copy to my friend, except that it is a signed copy, and even more importantly because I will want to pass it down to the next generations in my family. This reading is not pleasant, but it is vitally important. The history embodied in this book must be kept alive. Read it and pass it on."},{"Title":"Flashbacks: Prisoner of War in the Philippines","review":"I just so happen to be the great niece of Mr. Walter T. Middleton. This book was a very heart moving book to read. For a person to go through the treatment that he endured is a miracle. This book is great. He is an outstanding storyteller and this book is a page turner. I would recamend this book to anyone looking for stories during this time perod."},{"Title":"Flashbacks: Prisoner of War in the Philippines","review":"T. Walter Middleton gives you a great taste of folksy, oral history used to describe one of the most horrific sequence of events in US military history: the Defense of the Bataan Peninsula, the Bataan Death March, imprisonment in Camp O'Donnell, the Hell Ship experience, and slave labor for a Japanese corporation in Mukden, Manchuria.Mr. Middleton reveals many details of the horrors of those accumalated experiences. He does so, not with bitterness, but rather with a refreshing and surprising sense of humor. In one chapter he describes how his fellow prisoners discovered a large cache of marijuana which they smoked, and how in the midst of all deaths and diseases, they behaved strangely in an effort to have fun at the expense of the Japanese guards, who were completely confused by their unusual behavior. In one of the final chapters, he expresses the doubts he and his fellow prisoners had that they would ever again be able to fit into a normal, civilized society.Aside from being a \\"Great Read\\", this book will give it's reader a very personal look into the lives of the men who made the Bataan Death March.Fred BaldassarreResearcher/ArchivistBattling Bastards of Bataan"},{"Title":"Flashbacks: Prisoner of War in the Philippines","review":"Gives you a prospective of the events from the lower enlisted mans view and risks. An easy read which outlines the hardships the pacific theater POWs had to face."},{"Title":"Flashbacks: Prisoner of War in the Philippines","review":"The Japanese looked upon surrender as the lowest form of cowardice, a dishonor to not only oneself, but to that of his family and above all his country. They therefore treated any prisoner with a loathsome, vehement and barbarous attitude that is almost totally incomprehensible to us today.\\"Flashbacks,\\" the second of T. Walter Middleton's wonderful books, gives a personal account of his horrendous ordeal as a WWII prisoner of the Bataan Death March and Camps. Mr. Middleton was held captive for over three and one half years, and during that time he endured torture, disease, starvation, and a deprivation of humanity. Since that time, he has endured his own private hell, memories which have held him prisoner for decades.The writing of this book was an effort to purge some of those memories, those flashbacks, and to enlighten those of use who were fortunate enough to be spared horrors of this type. Some of his worst memories, however, have been omitted, as they were far too grievous for him to put on paper. Mr. Middleton also told me that after all he and the others had gone through, that after their rescue they were locked up in padded cells, because at that time they didn't know what to do for them. It was the closest he came to losing his mind completely. His salvation from his ordeal was his Christian upbringing, and he turned to God as he had been taught all his life.Mr. Middleton's style of writing is endearing to say the least. As a young boy who grew up in the mountains of western NC, his upbringing was founded in storytelling, a timeless art of tales handed down from one generation to the next. So, it is no wonder that his writing carries on much of this same style. That is, he writes as if you were sitting next to him, listening to him tell the story. I personally find this honest and refreshing, lending a personal touch to his book that is seldom found in most of the books written today. In his late eighties by now, his character and style is still unpretentious and genuine. \\"Flashbacks\\" is a treasure, a book to be kept and shared for future generations."},{"Title":"The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812-1822","review":"The author, Harold George Nicolson (1886-1968), served in the British Foreign Office from 1909 to 1929 prior to his impressive career as a scholar and writer. The present book was originally published in 1946 and clearly reflects Nicolson's diplomatic experiences. \`The Congress of Vienna. A study in Allied Unity, 1812-1822' is a historical (re)construction of the background, negotiations and result of the Vienna Congress in 1814-15. This chronologically structured volume begins with Napoleon's abandonment of his troops on the Russian fields in December 1812 and ends with the collapse of the conference system after the Congress of Verona in 1822. This unusual periodization is due to the author's intention with the work, namely to present \\"an examination, in terms of the past, of the factors which create dissension between independent States temporarily bound together in a coalition\\" (p. 46). According to Nicolson, the formation of the final coalition (The Quadruple Alliance) that defeated Napoleon began in 1812 and was dissolved ten years later.The main argument runs as follows: The basic principle that is required in order to establish an alliance is an agreement between at least two states to \\"subordinate their separate interests to a single purpose\\" (p. 49). In 1813 (as well as in 1914 and 1939) the purpose was the defeat of a common threat and enemy. However, once victory seems in reach, the common purpose begins to fade away on behalf of the separate interests of the allies. In other words, the constitutive element in the alliance is crumbling. The political controversials between the members are only brought to the surface once the war enters its final stage, even though the disinterests might have been latent all the way. Therefore, the negotiators often lack the necessary rational judgment once the political matter with the defeated enemy has to be settled which often results in frail peace treaties.This explanation theory appears very universal in its wording, which methodologically is a problem because it is only tested empirically on the Quadruple Alliance against Napoleon. But it is apparent, though, that the theory (as a hypothesis) seems applicable to the two world wars of the twentieth century as well. The Versailles Settlement, in retrospect at least, does not seem as the result of a very rational calculation, and concerning WWII we are already too familiar with the clash of separate interests between the two wartime allies, the United States and the USSR.Except for this issue of the seemingly general theory there are other flaws in the book. Nicolson's statement that Castlereagh's plans for a \`just equilibrium' objectively were ideal is difficult to maintain. Sure the scheme of the foreign secretary might have generated a perfect balance of power on the continent including Russia, but this was exactly in the (subjective) interests of Britain. As long as there would be no continental rival Britain would remain the world's undisputed leader. Nicolson does not deny this either but maintains that the British solution would have been the better for Europe at large. Why then, one must ask, was this plan rejected? I think the explanation is that the other great powers simply were not willing to accept British supremacy in order to establish a perfect equilibrium on the continent. If every continental power was prevented from gaining some kind of hegemonic status so should Britain. That is exactly why each power continued to achieve a balance-of-power-solution on its own principles claiming that this particular scheme would be perfect. Castlereagh's proposal was no different than any other idea. The reason for Nicolson's flaw is, perhaps, that he does not come up with any definition of the concept of \`power'. Directing his attention at the negotiators' various proposals to a post-napoleonic Europe he precludes any discussion of the power base of the participants. This is probably why Henry Kissinger has commented that Nicolson was \\"ascribing to negotiating skill what may have been due to a great many other factors\\" (Kissinger: A World Restored, p. 342).One last critique of this book: documentation lacks! Having in mind that the author solely draws on secondary sources (due to the war Nicolson was not able to consult archives across the continent) and that references are omitted, the reader must remain critical regarding the precise wording of quotes and exacts dates and times.Though I have focused on the negative, the book also includes many positive aspects. It is brilliantly written with an eloquence that ought to inspire many present day historians. What is an even greater delight is that Nicolson is completely aware and straightforward with his philosophy of history, that is the forces that determine historical process and the directionality of history.The book is suitable not only to professionals but also to the average historical minded reader."},{"Title":"The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812-1822","review":"The book begins with Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812, at the point when the rest of Europe realized that Napoleon could be beaten and they began to band together to do so. It ends ten years later with the last of the annual European Conferences and the suicide of Castlereagh. I'm passing familiar with the military history of these years, but that history is so not the point here--the Waterloo campaign gets all of three sentences: \\"On June 12 Napoleon left Paris determined at any price to prevent the junction of the Prussian and the British armies. On June 18 was fought the battle of Waterloo. On June 21 Napoleon returned to Paris a defeated man.\\" No, this book is a study of international diplomacy and statesmanship OFF the battlefield, among and between the Allies and France; the eponymous Congress of Vienna does get pride of place, but is not the sole focus by any means.Mostly a study of personalities: the suave Metternich, Henry Kissinger's hero in modern times; the club-footed Talleyrand, who changed sides within France as easily and as often as Lord Gro in \\"The Worm Ouroboros\\"; the mystical and reactionary Tsar Alexander; and mostly Castlereagh, the British Foreign Minister: glacial, inarticulate, overworked and depressed, and (so long as Britain's rule of the seas is not questioned, as indeed it wasn't) totally dedicated to a perfect balance of power. Maybe: Nicolson's sympathies are completely with Castlereagh and Britain (Britain's interests are \\"our\\" interests throughout the book), and it's not always clear, reading between the lines, that those interests were as absolutely impartial and altruistic as he makes them sound.Note the date of publication. While overt comparisons are not drawn, the parallels with 1945 are clear: Great Britain and its allies finally defeat a continental tyrant after years of war, and now try to set up a new international order to keep the peace in future. And like 1945-46, the diplomats concentrate so much on making sure the defeated power cannot make trouble again, that they fail to anticipate that the allies will turn on each other once the common enemy is removed. More overt parallels are drawn with 1919--Nicolson was actively involved in those negotiations. (He was the husband of Vita \\"Portrait of a Marriage\\" Sackville-West, for those who are interested.) Date of publication may also account for why Prussia gets relatively short shrift in the book, by the way: either sympathy, or access to sources, may have been hard for Nicolson to come by in 1945.So, not impartial and with some gaps in coverage, but an interesting and readable study of a neglected side of Napoleonic history. And worth pointing out that the international institutions and balance of power established by the Congress did last for generations: Nicolson kind of glosses over the Crimean and the Franco-Prussian Wars, but certainly no war engulfed the whole continent like Napoleon did until 1914, a full century later."},{"Title":"The Wild Bunch. Robbers Roost","review":"This is an excellent book about Butch Cassidy, his gang, and the myths and legends that surround them. That it's written by someone who knew and lived among many of the stories' characters makes it even better.Butch Cassidy was a jack Mormon outlaw, back in the 1880s, 1890s, and early-1900s, and was the unofficial leader of the Wild Bunch--a gang of hell-raising ranch hands named for their rowdy, trigger-happy visits to local bars. Butch led the Wild Bunch on the longest series of successful robberies in the history of the Old West, making use of well-planned attacks, attention to detail--like cutting all the telegraph wires along their escape routes--skilled horsemanship, and a seemingly impenetrable hideout: Robbers Roost.Robbers Roost was so isolated, so full of hiding places, so riddled with sudden cliffs and smaller canyons, and so hard for someone who didn't know the area to move through, that the Wild Bunch was secure in their hiding spots there. They would rob a bank, or a train, and then escape into a maze that only they knew the way out of, and where fresh horses and natural springs were waiting for them.It didn't hurt the gang either that rumors existed of Robbers Roost being guarded by two hundred armed men, surrounded in land mines, stocked with an almost limitless amount of ammunition, and riddled with a hidden network of tunnels and secret fortifications.As a result of such rumors, the area being so difficult to move through, and armed outlaws being willing to defend it, the area was never successfully breached by lawmen. Butch Cassidy eventually escaped to South America, and what happened after that is uncertain, though this book suggets it's pretty likely he came back to the U.S., and lived anonymously until the 1940s, when he died as an old man somewhere in the American Northwest.Supposedly, he never even killed a man during his entire outlaw career, believing murder to be the result of poor planning, and something that drew too much attention from the law.This book does a great job of detailing Butch's character, as well as the characters of the lesser known members of his various gangs. I checked this out as a reference book, and ended up unable to put it down until I'd read it all."},{"Title":"The Wild Bunch. Robbers Roost","review":"--A friend of Pearl Baker's family suggested I read this as it's about an area I love. Good suggestion. It's different from most history books as it's written as if the author was a neighbor to the outlaws mentioned. In fact, she was in a way. It takes the story (and that's what history is) from the plain (and verified) adventures of one or two men at a time. Each chapter follows them as they traverse the area centered on eastern Utah mostly around the late 1800s. It is not a chronological story following the heyday of cowboys, but of rustlers who were cowboys.There is little of the \\"creative storyline\\" that embellishes a tale. There are not many real descriptions of the harsh land, of the rugged existence of men usually on the run from the law, and of the composition of the small towns and the many ranches about during that time. There are just hints of each to remind you where all this took place. I suppose one could see romance in these mini stories, but it would have to be in one's mind. As a writer myself, I think how almost every chapter could be developed into a story of its own where you would feel the soft, dry sand in the San Rafael desert country. Where you could feel the heat of summer radiate off the colorful sedimentary rocks everywhere. Where you could touch the rough logs in the cabins throughout. But if Ms. Baker did this, she would not be true to the \\"history\\" aspect of what she was trying to relay to us.At times, I felt like she was an insider giving us the meat of the story and letting us fill in the \\"colorful\\" blanks as we could see fit. This is all the more reason why I feel her report was the way it really did happen as much as the remaining facts can show. It does get confusing at times as she mentions so many locations that are known to residents of that area, but not recognizable to most of us. The photos of some of the men mentioned are interesting, but I wish there were a lot more. But at that time, none of these travelers wanted to be that recognizable anyway, as even most had more than one name.There is a pretty good surprise near the end which will change your mind on some \\"facts\\" as you have known them in the past.This book will stir your imagination. If it doesn't, you must only like pirates, or aliens, or something.Ron Kelley"},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"This comprehensive book about anti-depressant medications picks up where Talking Back To Prozac left off. Dr. Breggin, through his vast personal experience and research as a medical expert in legal cases against the drug manufacturers, as well as his carefully documented research into the psychopharmacology of anti-depressants provides us with a great deal of information that is available no where else.Although quite disturbing to read, The Anti-depressant Fact Book is so well written and so clear that it is appropriate reading for the mental health professional as well as for the general public. Dr. Breggin discusses the meaning and purpose of depression as an emotional response to things, people, and situations in our lives, rather than as a biochemical disease in our brains. He points out that depression also reflects the contrasting desire in us that we have to live a more creative, meaningful life. This is in sharp contrast to the majority of the psychiatric community who sees depression as an imbalance of brain chemicals that must be corrected by drugs.Dr. Breggin explains in detail how the anti-depressant medications work, with special emphasis upon the selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors, (SSRIs') like Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac. He carefully explains how the SSRI's block the reabsorbing of the brain chemical seratonin, causing an excess amount of it to accumulate in the spaces between neurons both in the brain and elsewhere. He goes on to explain how the brain then tries to fight back from this chemical assault by permanently eliminating receptors. This process is called \\"die-back\\" and results in sub-sensitivity of the receptors, better known as down regulation, leading to permanent dysfunction.Dr. Breggin goes on to explain through current research findings, how the SSRI anti-depressants act in the brain like stimulants and he shows their striking similarities to the illegal drugs Ecstasy and cocaine in terms of dangerousness and the creation of Mania and akathesia. He goes on to describe a multitude of other problems that are directly attributable to these anti-depressants such as cardiovascular problems, parkinsonian symptoms, tardive dyskinesea, loss of sex drive, emotional blunting, suicide, and violent behavior. Of particular interest, Dr. Breggin highlights how these anti-depressant drugs often cause depression themselves, and particularly a very dangerous kind of depression; an agitated depression.This book clearly spells out the great difficulties that people encounter when trying to stop taking these drugs and it suggests ways to soften the rebound and withdrawal effects of the drugs. Breggin also devotes a chapter to the special problems encountered when children are given anti-depressants along with the exceptional; brain damage that occurs. He goes on in yet another chapter to discuss the resurgence of electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT) and to psychosurgery as treatments for depression. He likens ECT to a \\"closed-head electrical trauma to the brain.\\" He also devotes a section to how some of the recent school violence and school shootings are linked to the anti-depressants.Finally, Dr. Breggin devotes the last part of this book to how one can go about seeking real help for depression without the use of these dangerous and brain damaging medications. He describes how to find a therapist and what to look for in a therapist. I have found this book, written by one of the most well known and well respected psychiatrists in the world, a voluminous source of necessary and previously unobtainable information about anti-depressant medications. It is meticulously documented and highlights Dr. Breggin's lifelong work as the \\"conscience of psychiatry.\\" I could not recommend it more highly to both the professional mental health community and to the public."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"If you are looking for a good, general overview of the &quot;other side&quot; to commonly prescribed anti-depressants (which are far too frequently prescribed without much concern or interest in the actual good or bad they might do, IMHO), then this is your book. Well-researched, well argued, well analyzed. This should be the 1st book you reach for, if your doctor or psychiatrist recommends Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, or Luvox. Dr. Breggin does focus on the negative effects (higher rates of suicide and violence, increases in depressive feelings, criminal behavior, and dangerous drug interactions to name a few) and he is clearly not a strong proponent of the prescribing or taking of these strong drugs. But this is exactly the kind of person you want out there, providing you with this type of information that you would otherwise NOT get. Think about it: the TV and magazine ads and articles about these &quot;wonder drugs,&quot; your doctor(s), your friends who are already on these drugs, those crappy little &quot;warning&quot; labels printed up by the pharmaceutical companies and included with your prescription--how many of them fully discuss these other effects or even admit that they exist? But now you will know about them, and you will be in a much better place to make a fully informed, wise choice about the course of your medical treatment for depression. That alone is invaluable. Now it can be yours for the price of this book. Yes, these drugs can help some people. But please make sure you know the &quot;other side&quot; of the story, too."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"Dr. Breggin is clearly biased against psychotropic medication, but to discount his work on that basis is a mistake. He is a Harvard-trained psychiatrist with impeccable credentials, and his education and training led him to the beliefs he now holds. I find his writing and his views extremist: what it comes down to is a \\"blank slate\\" philosophy where environment is all that matters, not inborn traits. However, this is a helpful counterargument to the current biomedical model of mental illness where environment is irrelevant. Both views are too simplistic, as any thinking clinician will tell you that mental illness is almost always multiply determined, i.e. caused by several factors. People are not born depressed, but may become depressed over events in their lives; the genetic part involves how much it takes to make one depressed (or manic, or schizophrenic, or whatever illness it may be).Your physician will not give you the information in this book. Breggin will not tell you how beneficial medication can be. Take the information from both sides so you can make an informed decision before accepting serious, long-term medication."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"Dr. Breggin, Harvard-trained, is my favorite among psychiatrists and psychologists who have written on this subject. As he weighs \\"nature vs. nurture\\" as causes of depression, his comments emphasize environmental causes more than genetic or purely physiological causes. So why is this not bias? Because it's a valid view that needs to be stated in our social climate of overly pharmaceutical treatment tendencies.Since publishing my report, Mormon Women, Prozac and Therapy (readable on the internet by entering that title or my name into Google or other search engine), I received responses from nearly 3,000 readers, nearly all of whom were women who agreed with the general comments of the outlook represented by Dr. Breggin.Breggin is, above all, honest and fearless (he can afford to be, because of his ultracredible track record) in his warnings, assessments and general recommendations. While acting without a personal vendetta toward drug companies, he champions the position of so many women who have been whipsawed and manipulated by sometimes hapless physicians who too often have been in turn manipulated by under-educated drug salesmen who essentially parrot what the companies they represent have taught them.I don't think it would be reasonably possible to recommend this book too highly, to medical professionals, therapists and counselors, and thinking readers in general."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"Breggin's attack on serotonin-enhancing drugs claimed to be &quot;anti-depressants&quot; should be seen as a valuable cautionary in an environment which, due to the power of the drug-makers and the billions of dollars at stake, tends to promote them as &quot;happy pills.&quot; More controversial are his claims that depression is not a &quot;disease&quot; and that the use of antidepressant medications can cause irrevocable brain damage. The present-day tendency of calling numerous human problems &quot;diseases&quot; can, as Breggin asserts, discourage human solutions. On the other hand, if the problem is &quot;hereditary,&quot; it may not be so amenable to common-sense, willful, &quot;humane cures&quot; as Breggin claims. Moreover, the assertion concerning brain damage places him on relatively safe ground, since the widespread use of Prozac is scarcely more than 10 years old.Breggin touches on but fails to develop some important points. He suggests, for example, that the AARP is more interested in serving the big drug companies than helping its members but then drops the point. Certainly just as disturbing as the numerous prescriptions of antidepressants to patients motivated by a television ad to seek instant happiness is the indiscriminate prescription of antipsychotics to the elderly, especially in nursing homes where &quot;behavioral problems&quot; are an issue.In short, Breggin has covered this ground before. He's David going up against Goliath, a brave Lilliputian challenging the likes of Eli Lilly, and he doesn't let us forget it for an instant, reminding us of his credentials and past battles at every opportunity. Many of the &quot;facts&quot; he provides in this book are no more than the warnings of side-effects that are listed in the instructions coming with the medication. In fact, Breggin frequently quotes them, as though by doing so he has made his case.In short, this book will be of little value to the reader who has not been taken in by the extravagant claims and shameless promotions of the pharmaceutical industry or who has taken the time to look up information about a medication. On the other hand, for anyone who imagines that these medications do what they claim to do and that they are without side-effects potentially as disabling as the condition they are purported to treat, the book should be required reading."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"This should be required reading for anyone who is taking or knows some one considering taking an anti-depressant. I literally could not believe what I read in this book. The influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the media, as well as the medical profession is completely beyond reprehensible. Studies conducted by the pharmaceutical industry - sometimes as short as 6 weeks - are somehow considered sufficient evidence for the release of these drugs to the public.Dr. Breggin is biased, but he is biased for good reason. Many people are taking these drugs without knowledge that the clinical data has been manipulated to cover the hazardous side effects while promoting an innacurate picture of their efficacy.A highly readable and extremely informative book, well worth it's cover price."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"Peter Breggin has done it again. He has managed to overwhelm the fair-minded reader with so much knowledge, good sense and wisdom that it is impossible for him/her to reject his air-tight, wholly sensible arguments. The fact that he has been privy to the most sensitive data--internal documents from pharmaceuticals, hundreds of published and unpublished research articles, etc.--makes him the most qualified individual in the world to look critically at both the modern &quot;antidepressants&quot; and the empires that create and market them. If only every consumer could witness a debate between Dr. Breggin and the &quot;champions&quot; of the pharmaceuticals...what a glorious drubbing these champions would suffer! If you are considering buying this book, do yourself a grand favor: do it. Read it once. Don't attempt to highlight the good parts, because the whole book would be covered in marker. Then read it again. You will become determined to look critically at the propoganda that is foisted on you every day in the media regarding &quot;antidepressants&quot; and biopsychiatry. Every page is illuminating, shocking, sensible, sound, and ultimately, encouraging. I could not recommend this book any more highly."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"First, for those who keep saying that mental problems are not bio-chemical, that is like saying your heart doesn't increase when you get up to take a run. MIRs show that our brains are \\"doing\\" things under certain conditions/thoughts/feelings. What is our brain composed of? MANY biochemical components. The problem people are having with this fact is that people will medicate themselves unnecessarily when they feel any negative emotion, e.g. sadness, etc. I agree that is ridiculous and human emotions are to be experienced; there is a reason you get depressed, sad, anxious. It might be your bodies way of telling you something in your environment isn't right, you need to correct it. However.....Medication is over-prescribed and I've seen it do more harm than good, however, I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks. I go into a store and completely lose my mind and have to leave, I sometimes run out of meetings, I constantly feel like I'm having a heart attack, sometimes I cannot leave my house in total fear. These are things that you CAN work on without medication, BUT sometimes these symptoms are so debilitating and strong you cannot escape them without some help with medicine.I'm avidly against having to take medication, but some peoples problems are so severe they need help. As I said before, could my environment be causing my craziness? Yes but my environment actually isn't all that bad for me personally. So sometimes peoples brains are more apt to biochemical disturbances and imbalances for NO reason. I get lots of sun (sun has an effect on serotonin), I eat foods that increase serotonin, I have a happy life, good job, everything is awesome, but one day completely went nuts and couldn't leave my house, would get dizzy working out, and all the symptoms above. It wasn't just thoughts causing these problems. There was something taking place in my brain not normal. I took zoloft--low dosage--and it helped rid this problem and now I'm not taking it anymore. It helped me. I read that SSRIs can cause permanent damage over long periods of use, and high dosages. I wouldn't doubt it, but as with all things in life, you need temperance and balance. I think psychiatrist and doctors abuse prescribing to their patients. I think pharmaceutical companies can be bad, but there are TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY. Yes, money is the driving force behind pharmaceutical companies, not ultimately their patients, however, they do make medicine that can be effective, albeit the end-user being CAUTIOUS and smart about taking it. Any drug when taken too much can be bad, whether it's coffee, marijuana, or what have you. Having knowledge of that substance and a will power to have balance is key.Dr. Breggen is mostly right but he also disregards people who have legitimate mental disorders that cannot easily be remedied. In fact, he doesn't go to explain how to remedy panic disorder from my searches. What would a person like myself do who was about to quit their job because they were losing their mind at work? Medicine stabalized me. Yes it had side-effects, but I wasn't going nuts anymore. I was also able to get off it. I only took it long enough to get better, then weaned off."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"When I first saw this book, the title seemed very plain and a little simple, but there was something that intrigued me about this book, so I bought it and I'm glad I did.

He has done extensive research, and is regarded as an expert witness in many courts.Depression is a feeling, not a disease. To some extent, people choose to be depressed. Other people are depressed because they made bad decisions and did something they regret. Depression is not a result of a Paxil deficiency! Depression can be dealt with through natural means: re-thinking the decision to be depressed, seeking spiritual help, eating well, and so forth. These drugs really act by IMPAIRING the body and the brain in some way. They hurt people! Some people are particularly susceptible to the consequences of taking these drugs. Unfortunately, some doctors hand them out like candy. Few psychiatrists and psychologists take the time to really get to the root of the problem. However, good therapy is much, much more effective. In other words, the drugs don't work anyway.Dr. Breggin is specific about what these drugs do to the body. Sometimes a person has an impaired liver, which results in the drug accumulating in the body, which can mean a serious overdose. These drugs are particularly harmful to children. Campaigns to try to get doctors to prescribe these drugs to children are run by people who are committing crimes against humanity. They should suffer the fate they inflict on others.If a person is on such a drug, and does not stop taking it in a safe way, it can still cause violence, even if the person is no longer taking it. Sometimes mass shootings are committed by people who just stopped taking one of these drugs. Making the problem worse, some doctors will prescribe more than one. The drug companies cover up evidence of the harm they cause.I have seen how doctors try to COERCE some people to take these drugs against their will. If a person says the wrong thing and winds up being incarcerated in a mental hospital, they are vulnerable. I visited one mental hospital where the staff stayed in a locked cage outfitted with windows. The \\"patients\\" were also locked in. What happens if there is a fire? Why was the staff so afraid of the \\"patients\\"? I watched as a doctor tried to coerce a patient into taking a drug. He threatened the person and said she wouldn't be released if she didn't comply. The same doctor lied in the kangaroo court proceedings that decide whether or not the person continues to be held. These aren't people who have committed a crime. These are people who MIGHT do something detrimental. Last I looked, there was no such thing as a thought crime. This is a big money-making industry, for people who run mental hospitals, and for drug companies.Do you think lobotomies and electric shock treatments are things of the past? Think again. Dr. Breggin talks about that, too.I have seen how people I love get their personalities out of a bottle. It's scary.Why should you be concerned if you don't take these drugs? Simply because sometimes these drugs cause people to become violent. These drugs are often the trigger for shooting sprees aimed at strangers. Other people's willingness to take poisons affects YOU. You need to know about them. We need a change in public policy. These drugs should be banned.PLEASE read this book! People need to KNOW the DANGER these drugs pose to the general public. It's one thing for a person to take poison that only affects himself. It is quite another for him to take a poison that will make him violent. None of us is safe from the latter. If you value your survival, read this book and then act on it. Work toward getting these drugs banned.This author has written other books on the topic. I recommend you check them out as well. And expect people who have a conflict of interest to pan this book. They will.

This book bashes medication too much for my tastes."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"I did not read this book,(so cannot truly rate it) but read the description and all of the reviews. I am currently taking an antidepressant and it's working well for me (the generic of Celexa.) I have suffered from low-grade depression for most of my life, with a few major crashes over the years. I do believe it's from a chemical imbalance, contrary to what Dr. Breggin may purport. And I think it's always interesting when so many who make comments seem to have not experienced depression or ever used antidepressants. If, however, I had a child who was depressed, I would NOT want them to use psychotropics unless they absolutely could not function without themThe real problem is not antidepressants or other psychotropics, but the misapplication and over-prescription of them. Those with garden-variety depression need to do their research before taking any antidepressant, even when your well-meaning primary care doctor may be more than willing to give you a prescription (they don't really have the time to talk to you.) You may simply need some counseling or behavioral therapy. On the other hand, if you have a long-term depressive history (as I do) it may be a good idea to look into the possibility of antidepressants. Again, do your homework. We are our best health advocates. And you will need to consult with a psychiatrist who has more in-depth knowledge of psychotropic drugs than your primary care physician usually does (and \\"your doctor won't tell you\\" because he really doesn't know what to tell you.) Antidepressants and other related drugs require \\"tweaking,\\" trial and error and patience. If you have what is considered major depression and cannot seem to shake it, short-term or long-term drug treatment may be what is needed. Also no \\"pill\\" for mental illness is good without coinciding counseling (and your follow-up with your MD, including the psychiatrist, is not counseling.) That's my real beef with MD's prescribing psychotropics. Most MDs have no mental health training and mental health providers are not trained or certified to prescribe drugs.Please! Everyone, including Dr. Breggin, needs to remember how many people have been helped by the prudent use of antidepressants. Antidepressants and related drugs need be viewed just like other drugs: they are not for everyone, there is no \\"magic\\" pill, and virtually every drug has some side-effects. Let's get back to some balance on this issue and quit polarizing.Nan, Tampa FL"},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"I always try to consider different opinions while we're speaking of depression and other mental disorders. Nonetheless I must say M.D.Breggin's consideration of depression is pretty naive nowdays and in this society. Probably he'd never been depressed in his life. He talks of depression like a &quot;gift&quot; given to us for overcoming our's own life difficulties. Something we have to pass by only with our willn (but he doesn't consider that will is right the thing that depressed people miss). Other thumb down in my opinion is the fact that the author tends a little bit too much to attack pharmaceuticals and everything is chemical. Nothing's new here in Europe (where everything's not natural is considered dangerous) but I hoped at least in the US in a more objective and non-passionable point of view."},{"Title":"The Anti-Depressant Fact Book: What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Luvox","review":"Let me preface this review by agreeing with some of the points made in this book - antidepressants should be prescribed more carefully, less often, by psych doctors ONLY, and preferably only to adults. Cognitive therapy is the most effective long-term treatment for depression. I wholly agree with these statements.That being said, this book is just as inconclusive about the negative effects of antidepressants as any studies that say antidepressants are wholly safe for everyone... or at least in the way they are presented. The majority of studies were based on rats, and the permanent damage almost always in children whose brains are still in development. Based on previous reviews, I was hoping to read up on effects of SSRIs, without all the opinionated BS. I want to know the \\"hows\\" and the \\"whys\\", not the \\"whats\\".The book does a decent job of explaining how SSRIs work, though I think I might be better off getting a medical textbook if I really want to know. But when I reached this statement in chapter 2, I immediately put the book down:\\"... the stimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine overstimulate serotonin in a somewhat similar fashion to antidepressants, and they are proven to cause permanent dysfunction in the serotonin system.\\"Really? You're comparing SSRIs to METH?? In a \\"somewhat similar way\\"? Hey folks, go look up some videos on YouTube about the effects of antidepressants. Then, go look up some videos about the effects of meth, and you tell me - how can you even begin to compare the two?Bottom line - I do NOT recommend this book. If you're thinking of taking ANY medication, do your research, familiarize yourself with the side effects (all of which is what this book talks about and blows out of proportion, probably so you'll actually pay attention to them, and are always clearly listed on medications).

All medications have down sides and side effects. Celexa gave me my life back, and it is greatly disturbing to me that many people who need medical help beyond &quot;talk therapy&quot; will be discouraged from seeking it through fear and panic spread by Breggin. My doctor was not pro-pharmaceutical, he was desperatly searching for a med that would get me out of my bed and let me resume my life. Depression is a biochemical disorder, which has been proved beyond any doubt. For a chemical disorder, you need medicine, period. The same way a cancer patient needs meds.

He therefore has no experience with any. Untreated depression has a hard outcome, suicide at the peak age of responsibility and productivity. He is less a Ralph Nader type, than a hate speech advocate against modern psychiatry. He is similar to advocates of the horse when cars were first being made. He should be advocating accuracy,pragmatism and focus on what works. Some depressed patients benefit from anti-depressants and even electro-convulsive therapy. Some do not, benefitting from other therapies. Matching is the key, not extremist, obstructionist, heinous dogma.

I have tried everything, from exercise, to herbals, to vitimins, to theropy, and even though they help, w/o the drugs, I am unable to function. Yes, it is true, these are some strong drugs, and doctors do Overpriscribe them, yet at the same time, they can do wonders for people who dont react well to \\"Alternitive Theropy\\" so the person can live a normal life.

If you're looking for a book with a bunch of patterns to follow to draw specific subjects, then this book isn't for you. It is NOT a book to give to your child and say \\"Here's an art book for you.\\" It is written for adults who will be working with children...or who want to learn how to draw themselves.What this book teaches is a universal *method* which you can apply to *anything* you try to draw - once you learn the method and principles, you can draw anything you set your mind to!I got this book because I homeschool, and my daughter was showing signs of artistic ability at an early age - and I barely passed art class in school. I was lucky to get Cs or Bs for grades; I had no \\"natural\\" talent (and all my art teachers only seemed to have time for the talented students - the bright stars of the class, and the rest of us just floundered) I too grew up thinking that it was a natural talent, not a developed skill. I got this book because I didn't want my daughter's art progress to be hindered by my \\"lack of talent.\\"This book lit a fire within me and I thought - can I really draw too? I remember wishing I could draw - I had great things visualized in my mind but could never get them on paper - my drawings were worse than my three year old's!Well, this book did NOT disappoint. I have seen amazing progress in my work and believe in myself now. I have made a beatiful pencil sketch of my husband and also one of Pierce Brosnan - as well as some landscapes and still life compositions. This book only delves into the basics - I got insights on shading from some artist friends of mine...I think the more complex concepts are covered in the Drawing with Teens book by the same author.In conclusion - if you're looking for a self-guided book to hand to your child - this is not it. If you are looking for a catalogue of drawings to mimic, this is not it.If you secretly wished you could draw, but think you can't, or if you want to learn how to help your child draw - this is the book for you. I have had this book for three years love it. I am considering replacing it because I've used it so much it's falling apart!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I decided to teach my children art (ages 5 &amp; 7) during their X-mas break. This book served as the curriculum. It was excellent. I xeroxed the exercises (as instructed in the book), my kids were focused during the lessons.

They have developed their spatial awareness, which was my aim. &quot;Drawing with Children&quot; and its 8 basic shapes methodology is excellent for anyone who wants to teach or learn art in a school or home environment.

My students' drawings entered a new dimension when I began to use this mimetic method of art instruction to help them identify, and then draw, what we called &quot;drawing Legos:&quot; the little pieces that can be combined to make a whole object.While this method may be viewed as limiting creativity, I believe that it offers an important, foundational tool for anyone who is learning to see things as an artist sees them. Just as a pianist must learn the scales before he can play Beethoven, I believe that it is only with such an artistic foundation in place that students are able to truly express what they are trying to communicate through their art.As a university instructor training future art teachers, I am glad to be able to pass on this gem of a book to my students, who will train a new generation of children to see as the artist sees."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"The book is great; HOWEVER, my intelligent six year old was not mature enough for the lessons in this book. I meticulously read the directions (and followed same), but my daughter (who loves to create and draw) did not like the lessons because she has yet to perfect her fine motor skills (she likes to create stories but does not like the physical act of writing). I would suggest using this book for an older child (eight years old?), especially if your child does not have his/her fine motor skills fully tuned or does not like to sit still for very long. I admit that I was a little disappointed when the child illustrator on the front cover drew such a wonderful picture (age 5), but every child is different. Incidentally, my art skills (formerly limited to simplistic ball and stick drawings) have improved quite a bit since using the book!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I am 33 years old and have absolutely no artistic ability - or so I thought. I've always been interested in learning how to draw, but no matter what books I consulted, I still couldn't get it. The techniques presented there assumed you already knew some basics, but I didn't. My mother even told me that drawing is inherited, and since there is nobody in my family who draws, I felt I had no chance.Then I found this book. The first thing you are supposed to do before any instruction is to draw a scene a house, person, tree, bushes, etc. My picture looked like a 4 year old drew it. Now less than one week into the book, I am on lesson 3 with 2 more to go, and I am astounded at my progress. It's simply night and day. I get so engrossed in my drawings now that 3 hours will go by in a flash. My husband is now starting the lessons because he's amazed at my drawings. Today I even started sketching my husband's face as he was eating. It took all of 5 minutes and it turned out beautifully, if I do say so myself. Plus, I hadn't yet started the lesson on drawing humans. I sketch everything in sight and just can't seem to get enough.You may not need this book if if you already know how to draw and need more detailed instruction on technique, but definitely get this book if you need the basics of beginning drawing. You will not be disappointed. Drawing is not inherited, but developed.

We both have natural drawing talent and love of art. I was looking for a book to use to provide her more formal art instruction. While this book does provide this, you have to filter though a LOT of other 'theory and idea' material before getting to an actual lesson. The entire book includes only 5 lessons, but enough material in each lesson to cover three times that many *actual* lessons. In other words, one lesson can't be covered in one sitting with a young child but it will be your job to divide up the information to organize the 2-4 lessons needed to get through each lesson. This is not obvious from the table of contents, but quickly realized by the way the information runs all together. While I didn't expect a 'throw the book at your child and say here draw something' like some reviewers suggest, I did expect more of a workbook designed for implementing lessons, than a study of her theory.The author could have a much more useful book by simply organizing the material in sections by subject, rather than including a smattering of issues (fear/feelings, technique, supplies, warm up, examples, and lesson) under each 'lesson' heading. There are tons of subheadings under each lesson and it is difficult to organize the relevence to each to the actual lesson. For example, lesson 2 is at page 90 of the book! I had to dig for it just to see what exactly the lesson was, much less to get an idea how the author intends for the user to utilize it. The author really needs two books - one to cover her theory and a supplemental work/lesson book that shows how to provide instruction through actual lessons. It would be an easier read and follow, as well as, easier on the eyes to look at and brain to organize.That said, the actual drawing lessons (when you find them) provide great step-by-step instruction for articulating instruction to a child. I'm sure implementing the instructions will allow my child to create amazing things she didn't think she was capable of.

It really is a classic among them for good reason. It teaches drawing as careful, meditative observation that anyone can learn but also a skill that requires real work to improve. It's a superb pedagogical tool and resource--it has excellent structured exercises and very practical instruction. But it is also so much more than a simple \\"how-to draw\\" book. The writing feels at times like literary essay and I found it made me pause and reflect on my feelings and assumptions about drawing, art and critique.I bought it as a gift to my son (7 years old) but, secretly, also to me. It's so hard to find the time anymore to draw or write on my own. With the book, we were able to sit down and start drawing together on one afternoon. I could teach him a few key concepts and points, set up the task, and off we'd go...sitting beside each other drawing...and, magically, we'd both get so absorbed that time would drift away...the next thing we knew, a couple of hours had gone by.We've had a few more sessions--all at his enthusiastic request. The level of work that he has produced has really surprised both him and me. I look forward to working through all the chapters with him."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I bought the book to teach my son drawing. After reading the first 2 chapters, I became so inspired that I started drawing myself. I'd never drawn anything artistic before. But I was able to follow the lessons and was quite surprised at the results I got. My child is 6 years old and I could see the changes in his drawing once he got the 5 basic elements of shape concept.The book embeds many important concepts about how to teach children drawing between the lessons. For example, it explains the difference between symbolic drawing and realistic drawing in children and the importance of not interfering the development of each. These are very helpful for those who are new to drawing.I find the lesson itself pretty easy to follow, but the drawing theories and techniques between the lessons might take much more time to explain to a 6 years old. So I broke one lesson and the concepts into smaller lessons that last about half hour.The only thing I don't like about the book is: you need to make photocopies of some pages in the book for the lessons. It is not easy to make photocopies from a book--the pictures were distorted a bit and the size wasn't quite right. For lesson 2, I couldn't get a good copy of the lion --- the face is completely dark even though I used a commercial copier. I think this is the publisher's fault.In conclusion: I strongly recommend this book to those who want to draw or teach children to draw and think you are not good enough to start."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I used this book 3 years ago with a group of teachers who were interested in improving their art instruction.

The improvements to this current edition is wonderful. They are time tested by Mona Brookes and her fellow teachers."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Mona Brookes' \\"Drawing with Children\\" is one of three book which I purchased--the others being \\"Art for the Absolute Beginner\\" and \\"Art for the Utter and Absolute Beginner\\"--to get myself back into drawing, an activity which I enjoyed as a young person. Each book is different, and I have learned from each of them.Brookes begin with the premise that art can be taught, even to very young kids (toddlers) by teaching them to observe and reproduce the \\"Five Elements of Shape\\": dot, circle, straight line, curved line, and angle line. By this she does NOT mean the five basic shapes--which I interpret to mean the shapes of whole objects--an orange is a sphere, my computer is a cube (sort of), and so on--but rather the direction your pencil must follow to outline the subject which you are drawing. For example, when I draw a bird (there's lots of birds in the book), I draw a dot for the eye, surrounded by a circle; then I draw a curved line for the head, an angle line for the beak, and so on. Oddly (to me) each and every drawing starts with the animal's eye, or the center of the object to be drawn.This way of looking at drawing focuses on the outline of objects, rather than the basic forms which make up the object. She seems to have had much success with this method. My cat is asleep on the chair as I write this; he's curled up in a ball. Traditionally I would see him as a ball for his body and then a smaller ball representing his head, his long, tubular tail, and so on, sketching these general forms lightly on my paper. Then I would sketch some details of \\"sub-parts\\" that make up my cat, his oblong face, the curve of his haunches, the triangle of his ears, and so on, for guidelines. I would then move on to the details of his features: the shape of his mouth, the stripes in his fur, his whiskers; so that I can make an accurate rendering of him. I'd have to take into account such things as what direction the light is shining on him from, the shadows his body makes on the chair, the roundness of his form.\\"Monart\\" would have me draw a \\"curved line\\" for his body, until I get to the ears, then an \\"angled line\\", more curved line, then a straight line for his leg sticking out, and so on. The first couple of lessons show photographs of subjects to draw as well as a simplified line drawing. The student is guided to follow the outline of the subject by seeing and drawing the \\"elements of drawing\\". I had good success reproducing the drawings--level one through three-except for the carousel horse, which was a miserable failure. I believe that, in cases like this, it is more effective to use the blocking method described above, where you first observe and sketch the general forms that make up the animal, using that as a guideline to fill in the details.That said, I do like the results I have been having with this approach. I can easily draw several types of tropical birds, and follow the outlines of still life subjects. The drawings by children before and then after a few lesson are awesome, as are the color plates. The drawing preliminaries have helped me to relax and focus, so I feel more confident and ready. And I like how she gives lots of practice to drawing the elements, in increasing complexity, that guide even small children to build these skills that lead up to drawing. I've had fun with the coloring. Yeah, I know, I've got to get back to work with topics like perspective, light source, and other stuff. But for now I am \\"Drawing with Children\\"."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I really enjoyed using this over the summer with my five-year-old daughter. We didn't get through more than a couple of chapters, and we didn't work every day, but I saw such progress in such a short time. Both of us learned to look at things much more closely and how to replicate what we see. We are not finished, either. The exercises are low-impact and really interesting for kids. I now keep a sketch pad with me and just draw up exercises for her whenver we have some quiet time (church, etc.) She loves it. Now trying to draw something is fun for her, rather than frustrating. Love this book!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book. I was one of those who \\"could not draw,\\" and after reading the book through and doing all the exercises, I now can draw anything I want. It breaks drawing down into small manageable pieces (the five basic shapes), and once you learn to really \\"see\\" things, you are able to break drawing different items down that way. I have \\"taught\\" my grandchildren to draw using this book, and they look it."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"This book lays out the basics for the beginner artist; child or parent or teacher.It is easy and pleasant to read. One can work through it easily at one's kitchen table. (You have to be willing to turn off the phone!). The method is extremely simple but brilliant. Everyone can experience success by following these simple guidelines. The key is the same as the key to any skill: practise!How sad that many of us have forgotten that simple truth in education."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I started to use this book when my daughter was 3.5-years-old, she was interested in watching me drawing, and copying mine too. Now she is 6, she vulanterily draws for her 4 year-old brother. I definitely recomment this book to parents who don't draw much in their daily lives, but love art as much as their spare time allows them to."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"As an artist I was delighted to discover the first edition of this book--and more delighted when the second edition came out, with its inspiring section on teaching children with special needs. The before-and-after illustrations of students' work are most convincing; they're what I usually show people first of all when describing the Monart method to those who aren't familiar with it.I have used these guidelines in introducing both children and adults to the wonderful world of drawing, which Ms. Brookes clearly shows is available to virtually anyone who wants to learn--not only to those who already have &quot;talent.&quot; I especially appreciate her pre-drawn warm-up exercises, and her chart of the five basic line/shape elements that are used in all drawing. Permission is given to photocopy these pages directly from the book; alternatively, one may reproduce them by hand (they're very simple) and then copy the hand-drawn versions.Some three- and four-year-olds might be able to do the exercises and projects shown here; in fact, Ms. Brookes has samples of work from children as young as this. For teaching school age youngsters and up, however, it is definitely a good choice as a resource. It also works great with adults, who are sometimes more nervous and embarrassed about making mistakes and being laughed at than children. I particularly enjoy seeing adults who decided years ago that they just can't draw, producing lovely works of art after having just a few simple lessons right from &quot;Drawing with Children.&quot;"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"This book is amazing! It is perfect for children of all ages, as it talks about the drawing process, not just trail drawings.It is perfect for the home school, or for kids whos school district does not have art any more.It addresses the process of learning, and will help kids not only draw better, but do better in other subjects."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Finally a book that outlines techniques, tools, the artists environment and everything in between. The premise of the book is that we are not given the proper tools to excel as artists. Given the proper tools and instruction, anyone can greatly improve their drawing capability. I look forward to using the methods outlined in this book to assist my 6 year old aspiring artist in developing her talent. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"This book is a great way to get kids to realize that yes they can draw. It really gives great techniques and excercises that teach the basic elements of shape."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I am using the methods outlined in this book in my elementary school art classroom. The kids love the warm up exercises, and I am seeing great improvement even in just a few weeks. I have needed little adaptation of the materials from kindergarten through middle school. Its been a good choice for my kids, and made my job a lot easier!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"This is a good book to learn how to draw. However it helps if the adult helping the child or whom ever helps the child has some ability to draw as well."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Home school, two years ago, I failed horribly teaching this to my son who was \\"not at all interested\\" and didn't apply himself. However, I who have never even doodled, trained my eye to see shape and flow of line in everything. Look at me now: http://www.flickr.com/photos/lindielee/I started with stick figures and great embarrassment - forget ever playing pictionary!Total lessons in last two years:One Adult Ed. Summer Class - 8 sessions aprox.One Prophetic Art Class - 6 sessionsEndless online free lessons and utube tutorials a four month period.Honestly, I started with stick figures.This book has been invaluable to me, try it, train your eye and experience the joy of drawing!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I have a previously published book by Mona Brookes. I liked it very much, and purchased this issue to get a better insight in teaching pre school aged children. It was very helpful, while not providing specific lesson plans for my 26+ group( what would), it gave me simpler processes and approaches to help me out. I very much reccommend this book for anyone looking for ways to draw and teaching/seeingto many different age groups."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I bought this book on the advice that it was appropriate for younger children, but after reading it I am convinced that it will be several years before it is appropriate for my son. It seems to be more a \\"theory\\" book than a how-to manual which is what I was led to expect."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I wish that I had not purchased this book. The entire book could have been summed up in a chapter. It was very repetitive and filled with examples of children's drawings. Including a few drawings as examples would have been fine but they seemed to be used as filler. I did not find it very helpful in teaching me or my children how to draw."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Overall, pretty good, but not enough illustrations. I like a lot of pictures in my art books, and this book has very few."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I highly recommend this book for all ages. The lessons were fun for my [...] and my [...]. These lessons teach the children that they can draw without frustration or failure."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"This book was very informative and useful in teaching a basic drawing class. I really liked the layout of the book, it was pretty cohesive."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I am excited to start this book with my 5 year old. She loves to draw. I can't wait to see if the book's suggestions actually work..."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I think the basic concept in this book is excellent. It really helps the kids to break everything down to basic elements. It takes it past the usual shapes that kids are taught and makes it much simpler. She suggests that use markers and not pencils. I do agree that it is important to not always fix a mistake and that you have to study where you went wrong so that the next time you draw it you can do better. However, markers are messy with 4 and 5 year olds. I'd suggest using pencils and just telling them they can't erase. Also, she pushes the concept that there is no wrong way of doing art. I disagree with this idea. There is a right and a wrong way to draw a house. There is a right and a wrong way to draw a daisy. Imagine Monet finishing one of his paintings and telling him, \\"That's good, but really there is no wrong way of doing it. I could paint the same bridge and it wouldn't be wrong.\\" Crazy, huh?"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Haven't yet begun the lessons, but after reading the earlier reviews I can't wait! The ideas in this book make so much sense! We don't expect children to sit down at a piano a la Mozart and belt out original compositions. We don't expect our children to learn to read without instruction. Yet if they can't draw realistically, we chalk it up to lack of talent (after all, YOU can't draw either, right?).This book gives you the tools to teach your kids how to draw even (especially!) if you aren't an artist yourself. The author is also very generous in allowing unlimited photocopying of the exercises to elementary teachers which I think shows she genuinely cares about helping children learn. My only regret is that there is no Monart school nearby!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Over the past several years, I have seen the drawings of art students at the school where my daughter attends. I am continually amazed by the quality of the students' work as it is displayed at various times throughout the year. I have spoken with the teacher and found that she has been using the books, &quot;Drawing with Children&quot; and &quot;Drawing with Children and Teens&quot; for several years."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"The best thing about this book, as well as her other one for older children and teens, is that she isn't into teaching how to draw just one subject, such as cars, or monsters, etc., but wants to teach children how to draw anything they wish. And she does it in a creative way, so you can learn to draw freehand, not draw underlying framework that you have to erase later, as so many of the quickie drawing books teach.Adults can learn from her methods as well. In many ways Drawing with Children is much better than Betty Edwards' Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, simply because there is no right brain/left brain psychobabble to wade through between lessons, there are just lots of lessons. This is not to say that Edwards' book isn't useful--it is--but it is definitely for high school age and above.One caveat, however. Don't expect the same results from your young children without putting in the amount of time Ms. Brookes did with students in her school--from reading the book it seems they worked at their art daily, which is something that just doesn't happen at most schools, public or private."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Hi, when I went through this book I was excited with it. It really teaches theory and gives great lessons to develop your skills. If I was using it to teach my own children or just one or two kids at a time I think it would be great. But it seems to need a lot of one on one time with the child, or at least several more sessions than I had available for my class.Be aware that this book requires a lot of preparation (in my opinion)to be able to sit down and teach a child even if you only have one or two children. This is a great book if you have the time to first teach yourself, then you will be prepared to teach children."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I am delighted and amazed with the joy and confidence this book has given my daughter. She experienced a less than positive atmosphere in the realm of drawing (and the academic world in general), but skyrocketed within a month of utilizing this book. The Monart method is an easy to follow, easy to implement, fail safe method, insuring spectacular results!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I have just started using this book one-on-one with my 4.5 year old son. He was very interested in looking at the pictures in it and ready to begin simple lessons. This book presents an overall method for teaching a child (or adult) to draw. It does not present step-by-step instructions for every project. Thus, some initial reading and preparation is needed on the part of the instructor. I like the fact that once you understand the method and general projects presented, there is much room for creativity on the part of the instructor (or child) in creating new projects based on interest or materials you have available. I foresee using this book with my children for many years."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"My stepmother taught me to draw with this book when I was 7 and now I'm using it with my homeschooling cirriculum for my kids. It's a terrific tool to de-mystify the artistic process and help find your own artistic voice. As an adult, I found the refresher course extremely useful. My 9 year old son, who is notoriously technical-minded, immediately understood the five families of shape and started breaking down the objects he saw into manageable mediums to put onto paper. He had been frustrated with his drawing until I found the copy I had used as a child and began using it in our curriculum.The best thing about the book is that it teaches you to accept your creative voice. Children's pictures are often primitive and they get frustrated that it isn't an exact copy, but (as the book states) if they really want it that perfect they could just take a picture. Their creative voice is what makes a drawing special, after all.I would definitely recommend this product and the use of resources like the addendum lesson plans here: http://www.redshift.com/~bonajo/dwclp.htm"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I've read the book, and both of my children have been taught in their schools by teachers using the Monart method. I am very pleased with the results. I first heard of this book from my mother, she was a first grade teacher without an extensive art background, and used it to improve her art instruction in the classroom."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"I have been using MOna Brookes method for over 20 years . My students come away from a few lessons drawing on their own at home. I am able to \\"weed them away\\" from me so they become independent artists of on their own! That is proof this method works."},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"Oh, if only EVERY teacher had a copy of this \\"how to\\" book! If teachers had their children drawing in every class, what a great eduction system we would have. Readers, please take the time to read the sections on \\"using drawing to teach other subjects!\\" And of course the enlightened \\"reaching special ed and at risk students.\\" Take the time to create your own exercise sheets, and do the step by step drawing of the bird, lion, parrot, and horse and you will see the method and how it works. I have always been an artist and it is easy for me to see how powerful and exciting this teaching concept is. Thank you Mona for Monart!"},{"Title":"Drawing with children","review":"The title sounded like what I was looking for, a book to help my grandson to draw. This book don't even begin to show how to draw. It contain alot of filler pictures. It is the first time I regret buying a book from Amazon. Thank heaven for their generous return policy."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"We hear many stories of the bad things our law enforcement personnel perpetrate against criminals.

I hope he finds the comfort he so deserves."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This was an exciting book to read.

What William Queen did was above and beyond the call of duty. My only disappointment in the book was that he didn't tell about what happened to the two bad El Monte cops in the end (if anything)."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book was a fast-paced read. My son read it in two days and my husband read it within a week. If you enjoy reading stories about gangs and the underworld, you will definitely want to pick this up. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Rather than be long winded, as a public librarian let me just say this book is worth your time to read whether you are a non-fiction fan, or are inclined to novels. This book is a can't miss production, well written, poignant...alas, I am not at a loss for adjectives. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"To the reviewer \\"Leslie Pam\\" - anyone who read the book will see that the author says to his children that if he could give up everything he gained from his undercover investigation to have the time he lost with them then he would do so. And while he was working, his children were being looked after by their mother. (Would \\"Leslie Pam\\" have us believe that their mother is no better than the biker Rocky's wife? This is implausible, and so \\"Leslie Pam's\\" comments on this topic are pretty worthless.) In sacrificing much of his home life for over two years, the author made the world just a little bit safer not only for his own children, but for everyone else's too. This sort of heroic conduct cannot be measured in dollars and cents, not matter what \\"Lesle Pam\\" says. Perhaps she wants the state to make no effort at all to apprehend criminals. What sort of society would we have then? As for what \\"Leslie Pam\\" believes or does not believe about the author's behaviour during the operation: if it's not in the book and you've got *no* proof - at all - for what you're saying, \\"Leslie Pam\\", then all we have is your own unsupported assertions. Which once again, are worthless. I think that \\"Lesle Pam's\\" review is self serving hype. Whereas the book, \\"Under and Alone\\" provides us with a valuable record of the sacrifice one man made in order to send a group of dangerous and violent men to jail. Well done Bill Queen."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen did a great job - first as an undercover agent then as a writer.Most interesting for me was his portrait of the Mongols MC. He didn't present them in very favourable light to say the least. They are criminals, brutal and violent but also heavy dope users, unreliable and simply stupid. I only wonder how such bunch of degenerates on bikes were so successful when facing stronger and more sophisticated Hells Angels? They not only didn't cease to use red and white colors the Angels ordered them to do but won a bloody fight with them 3 years ago in Laughlin, Nevada which left 3 Angels and one Mongol dead. I wonder why HA didn't retaliate.I know Hells Angels mostly from the books of Yves LaVigne, of course. He portrayed them as a big, omnipotent, omnipresent and sophisticated crime organization. After readind Queen's book I have some doubts. How can't such a powerful organization like Angel's cope with such a bunch of neanderthals on wheels i.e. the Mongols MC?Either Mongols are not so stupid and degenerate as William Queen portrayed them or Hells Angels aren't so powerful as Yves LaVigne claims."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I was expecting alot more actual stories; instead, kept hearing about how brutal they were and all the criminal activities.Seemed like a second hand report on supposed criminal activities. Maybe, being a long time biker made it seem intended for the nonbiker to further their disdain for bikers in general.I found it to be very tame compared with other books of the same genre.Try being friendly to an OTW, for a couple of beers you can learn alot more activities."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This story comes across 'almost' fictional but I sincerely believe it is not.It's very hard to believe the author lived this life and lived to write about it.

However, I've just about run out of books on the subject ...('Jupiter's Travels' is the best of the bunch).Next, even though I wasn't much interested in motorcycle gangs, I read 'The Road to Hell' - an excellent documentary about the Hell's Angels in Canada. That book surprised me because I didn't realize how powerful the biker gangs are ... and it sparked my interest in motorcycle gangs.So, I read 'Under and Alone'. This is not a documentary at all - it's a very personal story. The author struggles with conflicting emotions, which make for a very compelling read ... and I was surprised by how literate the author is, considering he was able to pass himself off as a biker. This book just seems like and honest tale very well told by an honest man.Because I enjoyed this book so much, I went on to read 'Detours: Life, Death, And Divorce On The Road To Sturgis', (hoping for as personal a story) but I'm not enjoying it at all - I'm having a hard time warming up to the writer.Bottom line ..

He's the new gold standard by which all undercover police officers will be judged. Infiltrating the Mongols required an incredible amount of courage and personal sacrifice. William Queen put his life on the line every single day for two and a half years. The story will draw you in and will have you reading page after page to find out what happens next.

I found the most disturbing thing to be the movement of the gang across the United States, establishing locations in areas where local police have no experience dealing with them. Seeing the gang from the inside is a revealing and eye-opening story."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"The other reviews will tell you about the book, so read them also. What I want to say is Queen is a TRUE American hero. In this day and age everybody that does just about anything is being labeled a hero - mostly not deserving. Queen demonstrates the true requirements of being a hero - self sacrifice, and dedication to duty. Queen and the other ATF agents that perform these very highly dangerous assignments have the stuff heroes are made of. This book should also take away the Romanticism some idiots seem to have with outlaw biker gangs. OMC are not cool they are violent and could not give a sh&# about America, except to hide behind a liberal law or two. No read this book see the truth, and come to know what it really takes to be a Hero. In addition, hopefully we will see the one on the Hell's Angles ATF conducted."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"In a global economy of perhaps $5 trillion a year, fully another $2 trillion a year is illicit (see the book by Moises Naim of that title). This means not only that there is $2 trillion a year in illegal activities that include murder, rape, trade in women and children, and so on, but also that this $2 trillion is not taxed and therefore does not contribute to the social programs that are essential to keep a nation strong. Since motorcycle gangs are now global, vicious, and largely \\"out of control,\\" the book struck me as helpful and worth reading.It is worth reading, and there is no question but that the author risked his life, perhaps even ruined his life, by spending a long time penetrating the Mongols, arguably the most vicious (and unwashed) of the motorcycle gangs.I put the book down with three thoughts:1) There has got to be a better way to put gangs like this out of business. Cities have sanitation codes, there ought to be a way to keep people like this in remediation without having to risk officer's lives penetrating their gangs.2) An awful lot of taxpayer dollars and a lot of very high-quality officer time went into this, at great personal risk, with relatively marginal results.3) Gangs share a couple of similarities with terrorists: they have access to very high-powered lawyers and a great deal of money when they need it; and law enforcement is ham-strung by out of date laws and conventions that insist on treating out and out ruthless \\"Mongols\\" with the same rules used for more civilized members of society. I cannot but help conclude that we ought to have a \\"no holds barred\\" option on gangs in the same way that we now have a no holds barred option on terrorists."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang is a great book about a great man.He should be president!!!i wish all law enforcement was like him."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Since I am a retired ATF agent myself and know Bill personally, it is an easy book to read and review.

This undercover agent did his job though &amp; he did it well but along the way he got a new family &amp; then turned on them, he is a rat. I don't agree with murder, rape or any other kind of law breaking but I do believe in family &amp; if you go into this gang &amp; they treat you like family I don't believe you should rat them out.

I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a different aspect of organized crime."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This was a truly remarkable account of Agent Bill Queen. I it wonderfully written with an edgy element. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"The author is a brave man, no doubt, and the subject matter is a good one, a view into a side of life most of us will never see. Unfortunately the writing wasn't very good, many tired cliches and lame metaphors made this a clunky book to read."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"After reading the reviews and dust jacket I was expecting a book with some interesting stories but every chapter left me wondering why I was wasting my time on this book. He risked his life and went undercover but what did he discover? a bunch of losers who fight each other and do crank. All of the BIG moments in the book came and went with out much detail, excitment or anything that would make me care. The supposed plotting to kill a LA county sheriff is a great example. Their was no plot, he just happend to drive by the mongols campground and one of the drunken bikers on parole says \\"If he stops I'm going to take him out\\". Not much of a story if you ask me. I will be sending this one to the used book store asap."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Brilliant book. Loved it!William Queen is an exceptionally brave and dedicated man.He's a lot more intelligent than his fellow Mongols but fits right in. He really brings out the cameraderie and love between the biker gangsters that is one of the main attractions of the life they lead despite their often thuggish and scummy behaviour.Queen is also a very good writer considering his actual job is a law enforcement officer."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book is and incredible look at a man who was able to infiltrate the Mongol MC. I have met Mr. Queen in person and was one of the lucky few to hear him speak on his unbelievable story. He is a great man, and if you have any interest in Outlaw Motorcyle gangs, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I bought this book for myself and a buddy of mine. After we both read the book we couldn't stop talking about the characters and the whole ordeal. I couldn't put the book down after the introduction page. I would read one chapter then find myself 3-4 chapters deep before I knew it.It made me feel that I was reliving this man's experience and I was part of the excitement of his undercover realm.I rate this book a 5 star rating, because the ease of reading the book and the gripping story that kept me captivated."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It doesn't matter your view on patch clubs - be they modern day Robin Hoods, a bunch of guys out to have a good time, or gangs of thugs - you would have to agree an undercover agent trying to infiltrate one of these clubs is really putting his life on the line.ATF Special Agent William Queen - aka biker Billy St John - doesn't attempt to get into any old club, he is approached to go under as part of an operation against the Mongol Nation. The Mongols are reputedly one of the most violent outlaw biker clubs in today's America. Not only does he go through the arduous journey of first being accepted as a hang around, and then a Prospect, he actually gains full patch status within the Mongol Nation. This is despite never being trusted by Red Dog who is always in \\"Billy's\\" face and dealing out physical abuse.Under and Alone is an incredible page turner and to draw it out I had to really force myself to put it down on numerous occasions so I didn't finish it in one sitting. This is an amazing insight into the world of the 1% patch clubs and through reading the book you can see \\"Billy St John\\" is responsible for literally saving the lives of many people. He does this for the most part by deflection through reasoning with his brothers who are ready to just flippantly murder someone; and at other times it's by fighting shoulder to shoulder with his \\"Pres\\" and attempting to remove the person from murderous harms way, without appearing to do so.For more than two years William played the part of biker Billy St John and you can really feel his personal anguish as the lines blur between his role as an ATF Special Agent and the camaraderie of being a full patch member. Despite feeling torn at times it's never long until William is reminded just why he is doing his job. Gun running, drugs, random violence, extortion and murder are among the many things William testified against the Mongols when the operation was finished and are covered in this book. William is a fantastic writer and you can feel his every emotion as he goes through the roller coaster ride of being a brother in the Mongol Nation."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This story of an ATF officer infiltrating the very tough Mongol motorcycle gang in Southern California is interesting but I have one question. Was it really worth the time and expense to catch a bunch of small-time gun runners, dope sellers, and miscellaneous crimes such as wife abuse and various assaults? This isn't meant to demean the excellent undercover work by Bill Queen but as I read the book my first thought was whether it was really worth the time/money not to mention risk to Bill Queen. For example one of the main gang members who Queen initially meets is Rocky. But he's not a major player. Abusive to his wife, can't hold a regular job, neglect bordering on child abuse and yes, he is a small time thief, gunrunner, drug user/seller and miscellaneous assaults. At some points I found myself laughing at these overgrown adolescents who really just want a sense of brotherhood.And that is where the book is the best, describing the camaraderie of being a member of the club. When Queen's aunt (think quasi-mother) dies, he hits on how touched every member of the Mongols were but his ATF partners showed no such compassion, probably just because they are busy with their own lives. He also overlays how this time-consuming operation damaged his family relationships and eventually led to his ex-wife and kids being moved for fear of retribution. But the summation statement of this book is when the Mongol arrests start and a fellow Mongol calls to tell him they know who the snitch is and they are going to kill him. Unfortunately, they don't realize it is Queen so he has to disclose that he is the snitch to save the other member's life.Other than feeling that the story was somewhat exaggerated to make this mini-crooks look like the worst people in the world this is an entertaining book. Not the fastest read I've had but if you are like many Americans and fascinated by current day outlaws it is enjoyable."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Great read! Well written and full of informative details. William Queen, aka Billy St. John, I was riding with you in spirit, my antacid at the ready. Thanks for your valuable service to your fellow man. I hope your family life now reflects the true love in your heart. Your are a good man!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It is one-part historical, with a look at some of the most notorious motorcycle gangs in the world, and the crimes that they commit. It is one-part sociological, with an interesting view of war veterans and the different paths they choose in society, the stereotypes that society places place on all bikers (not just the \\"one-percenters\\"), as well as the fascination some have with these outlaws that often result in tragic consequences. It is also psychological, as some aspects of the undercover operation are truly mind-provoking - how does Bill Queen maintain his sense of right versus wrong when he feels more acceptance from the Mongols than his own department? How does Bill Queen cope knowing that any chance in demeanor from any one of his fellows Mongols might bring his unsuspecting demise? It's a book that you can't put down, and it will raise the hair on the back of your neck more than once.Finally, to would-be readers that may be discouraged by Leslie Pam's review, she clearly fails to understand that not only did Bill Queen make sacrifices, but his children, friends and family did as well, so that other children like Rocky Jr. and Easy's sisters' children can grow up safe and enjoy future birthdays, without the senseless violence, drugs, and poverty around them."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"After reading \\"Under and Alone\\", I had the opportunity to meet Billy Queen and speak with him regarding his UC life and the operation with the Mongols (what still wasn't classified). What he wrote in his book is just a small portion of what he did and he did it as a professional law enforcement officer. He never compromised his personal or professional principles so he could be one of the boys and he never broke the law to enforce the law. He had his \\"line in the sand\\" which he never crossed.To date, no federal law enforcement officer has been under cover longer than Billy Queen.What he wrote is true, real life and heroic."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. I was immediately engaged in the book. I started reading it on a flight to Mexico. By the time I landed five hours later I had finished the book!The book has everything: drama, excitment, action, and the unexpected.I am not a huge book reader and LOVED this book. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Kept me awake long into the night. This book gives an insider's account of what goes on inside the true motorcycle \\"gangs.\\" We're not talking advertising execs who ride Harleys on weekends. This is the real stuff, down and dirty. You gotta wonder about Queen, being willing to infiltrate a gang like this, then risk his life writing a book about his experiences. It reminded me of Donnie Brasco, the way the author becomes so much a part of the gang he's infiltrated that he has a hard time breaking away. Great book and I'd highly recommend it to my friends. Another book I'd recommend that I read this year is one called, \\"She Wanted It All\\" on Austin's Celeste Beard case. Amazing true crime book. For all of you who decide to read it, Enjoy! I did."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"They ran drugs and trafficked in guns to fill the group's coffers; they got their kicks from assaults, gunfights, stabbings, and other hideous, random acts of violence. I still can't get over how he survived all that time under cover with out a scratch.During his initial \\"prospecting\\" phase, Queen was at the mercy of crank-fueled criminal psychopaths who sought to have him test his mettle and prove his fealty by any means necessary, from selling (and doing) drugs, to arms trafficking, stealing motorcycles, driving getaway cars, and, in one shocking instance, stitching up the face of a Mongol \\"ol' lady\\" after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her boyfriend.A riveting story of a one-of-a-kind officer that takes you to the deepest and most dangerous part of undercover work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen spent 28 months undercover with the Mongols motorcycle group - feared more than Hells Angels. His bravery and \\"street intelligence\\" are incredible. Drugs, illegal weapons, gang-rape, witness intimidation, brutal beatings, and motorcycle theft were the gang's most common unlawful activities.Introduction to the group was via an informant who wanted to get back at the Mongols; unfortunately, the informant also let the Mongols know what she wanted to accomplish, leading them to suspect Queen. To gain stature and prevent being exposed as an ATF agent, he had to fake snorting meth, and appear ready to participate in a gang rape (luckily the intended victims did not show up). Final acceptance required passing a background check using his Social Security #, VA records, last five years' W-2 forms, criminal records, high-school records, and relatives - in this case all made up by the ATF.Queen reported several instances of the gang's criminality and brutality: 1)A fellow prospective member who changed his mind about membership had to play Russian roulette to get out. 2)Members wanting out had to have their Mongol gang tattoo burned off. 3)One member had been convicted of child molesting his sister's children - because she turned him in he was plotting to kill both her and the children. (Queen managed to thwart those crimes.) 4)Another member, unable to redeem his pawned motorcycle, wanted to kill the pawn shop owner (again Queen was able to avoid this crime).Shortly after becoming accepted, Queen became chapter Secretary-Treasurer, replacing the functionally-illiterate incumbent. This afforded Queen (and the government) detail about the group's activities that otherwise would not have been available.Queen paid a steep price for his undercover status - not only did he have to risk his life daily and subject himself to a highly destructive lifestyle (drinking, fighting, fast riding), his girlfriend dropped him, he missed many opportunities to be with his sons, and ultimately they were moved far away from him as part of a protective relocation.The prosecutorial rewards, unfortunately, were not commensurate, in my opinion: Seventy illegal firearms, two kilos of cocaine, significant amounts of marijuana and meth, and 53 convictions. (Queen only elaborates on one sentence - \\"Red Dog\\" - one of the worst members - received only a three year sentence.) This is not a criticism of anyone - just the depressing reality of how difficult it can be to attack organized crime.Two years later, the Mongols and Hells Angels gangs met in Laughlin, NV - and two people died. Unfortunately the Mongols did not go out of business - no fault of Queen's. I only wish we had applied his talents to anti-terrorism!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is a very insightful book that delves into the inner workings and brotherhood of the Mongol MC. Very compelling work by the author, who deserves a great deal of respect for putting himself in that kind of jeopardy. It's very interesting to see how the author is drawn into the lifestyle and ultimately becomes somewhat torn between the new family he has become a member of, and his obligations to ATF. This is a great book for anyone interested in learning more about outlaw motorcycle gangs from the inside out. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is one of those books you don't leave alone until you finish. I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. The author went under cover for two and one-half years, infiltrating the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang. Before becoming a \\"full patch\\" or full member, he had to endure being a \\"prospect.\\" He ultimately is successful but is almost derailed by law enforcement bureaucrats along the way.The only part of the book I find hard to believe is that he was able to abstain from some of the rowdy or raunchy behavior. I would think an under cover operation would have to look the other way rather than risk being found out. Queen was in situations where he was asked to take drugs, fight, kill, rape and steal. He emphasizes that he got out of doing these things but I have my doubts. All told, though, a very exciting and interesting true crime story."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I bought this book in an Airport Wednesday afternoon, and during my free time around work and home finished it by 8:00 Saturday morning. I couldn't put it down. It was an easy read,and exciting every step of the way. Unfortunately, this is the only book I've found by William Queen as he isn't an author but an ATF agent. I'm not into motorcycles or gangs, but with William Queen writing, I would buy any non-fiction book of his about any undercover or ATF agents in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"From the first page to the last, you will be glued to this book. I read the book in 1 day. I have never been able to read a book so fast in my entire life. Queen is an amazing agent who risked his life every second for 28 months to take the Mongols down. I have no idea how he was able to stay in for so long. I also learned alot about the Mongols. I've had the book for less than a week and I have read it two times already. I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I heard about this book on Fresh Air (public radio) when the author was interviewed. This book is an opportunity to catch a glimpse of a world that most of us know exists, but with which we otherwise have no connection and of which we have very little knowledge. The story is well-told, well-written, and an extremely satisfying read. I wish it had been longer; I read it in just a few hours. It would have been nice to have a deeper look into the lives and personalities of the figures highlighted in the story. I was deeply impressed by Queen's ability to spend two years at this, repeatedly placed in situations that nearly resulted in his death. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Finally an outlaw motorcycle gang (o.k. \\"club\\") book about a club other than the Hells Angels. The book was fascinating stuff and I could hardly put it down. The Monguls MC the author writes about appear more ruthless than even the notorious Hells Angels. In fact the conflicts between the two clubs Mr. Queen writes about had me on the edge of my seat. I never realized the Monguls MC had been around as long as Mr. Queen states. All in all a great book very worthwhile reading for folks into the outlaw motorcycle scene!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book was incredible, kind of like the guy who wrote it. Talk about serious fortitude! As someone who knows a little about the culture, I know that Queen's account is a no nonsense, honest, account of outlaw life. To say his undertaking on behalf of ATF, and the public at large, was brave doesn't begin to describe it. This book was a page turner. The only let down was that it came to an end! I could've read another 200 pages! Queen is a true American hero with an incredible story to tell. A must buy!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I have never written a review before but this is without a doubt the best book I have read in a long time.

Reading this book made me realize that the only really dangerous outlaw street gangs our society suffers from are the ATF and the police. The character and ethics displayed by those agents portrait in this book are despicable. Personally I would feel safer in the hands of one of these gang members than in the care of one of these aloof, self righteous, judgmental, and (unfortunately) powerful officers of the \\"law\\".I feel sorry and am very sympathetic of those poor souls trapped by this unethical and deceitful agent of the ATF. Prior to reading this book I held motorcycle clubs such as the Hells Angles and Mongols in distain, now however I feel differently. These groups are victims of over zealous, self righteous men that use the \\"law\\" as their weapon of choice."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This guys tales are unbelievable. Like most cops everything is over the top, not to be believed. Everything is black and white to this guy. If you want to read a cop tale written at a cop's intelligence level, grab it. The part where he claims how he never did drugs during undercover operations were bizare. For him to questions the integrity of the Hells Angels was ridiculous at best.

Maybe it is ok for some real bored people interested in this subject. Problem is, nothing here. Wow what a rip off of a story , it makes no sense, it sounds like a few nights of riding with a 1%er club and a lot of assumptions.The main player a guy who works with the ATF and was accepted into the mongols MC . He drives around in a junk mustang with bullet holes in it? and his front is he has a good job in the avionics industry.(Wonder why he dont have a radical pickup or SUV or cadillac like most hard working guys in motorcycle clubs)?All most all of the story lines make no sense, All of the members that are supposedly these career criminals, and organized masterminds are all out of prison . ( I think that the book is not even a year old).Something is missing , he must of gave them drugs to sell, thats the feeling I had after reading it.

During his undercover career with the ATF William Queen lost his wife, saw his kids practically grow up without him, lost another girlfriend, and very nearly lost his life on numerous occasions. He lived an isolated life for two years while infiltrating the vicious Mongols motorcycle gang, during which time be bonded with them like family and brothers all the while enduring the draining emotional torture of knowing that eventually he would have to turn on them and send them to prison.99% of motorcycle clubs are made up of law abiding citizens. ATF agent William Queen went after the self-proclaimed \\"One Percenters,\\" the outlaw motorcycle gangs involved in the illegal gun trade, drug trafficking, extortion, car and motorcycle theft, rape, and murder. Undercover as Billy St. John, Queen infiltrated the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols, eventually rising to the coveted status of full member. He even became club treasurer, enabling him to build evidence in the case. Eventually the operation developed into the most extensive undercover operation into a motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement. Queen's undercover work with the Mongols led to the indictments of 54 people, of which 53 were convicted.Queen's background includes a stint in the Special Forces in Vietnam where he earned the Silver Star. He then became a Federal Agent with the ATF like his father and conducted undercover operations against Ku Klux Klan and Skinhead organizations. After the Mongols' investigation he was awarded the Federal Bar Association's Medal of Honor, but to tell his story Queen has paid the price by having to live in hiding under the Federal Witness Protection Program.Under and Alone is an adrenaline-filled read and a real page turner. Besides just documenting the illegal activity of the gang, Queen lives in constant fear having to worry about being found out and probably murdered because of it. There are instances of him being stopped by unknowing regular police who very nearly blow his cover on a number of occasions. He has to keep a close eye on things around him in case he has to break cover himself to prevent a rape or murder, and uses his diplomatic skills many times to talk his way out of difficult situations. He fights with the Mongols, drinks with them, drives the getaway car, and bonds with them in a way neither he nor we expect. In one telling instance Queen's mother dies while he is on assignment, and his Mongol brothers are there for him in a way that his co-workers at the ATF never are.Despite these unimaginably dangerous situations and conflicting emotions, William Queen maintains his integrity, a personal \\"line in the sand\\" that he will not cross. It is this integrity that makes Queen stand out as a Federal Agent and makes his account in Under and Alone stand out as a classic in its genera."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"My boyfriend is a die hard motorcycle anything fan.

Overall good story."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I'm apparently on a tear with undercover cop books, having read of \\"Donnie Brasco's\\" infiltration of the mob fairly recently and \\"No Angel\\" a few months ago. William Queen's \\"Under and Alone\\" is very similar to \\"No Angel.\\" Both track the story of undercover ATF agents penetrating outlaw motorcycle gangs - the Arizona Hells Angels (No Angel) and the LA-area Mongols (Under and Alone).In \\"Under and Alone,\\" William Queen is heroic for placing his life on the line in a successful effort to gather evidence and jail a band of motorcycle killers, gun and drug dealers. He did this as Billy St. John, a biker who worked his way up to a full patch (full membership) with the hard living Mongols. Although a back up team was always nearby, he was frequently alone with bikers who sometimes questioned who he was and had killed previously. Sacrificing time and any semblance of a normal relationship with his kids and girlfriend, Queen lived the life as St. John on a fairly full time basis for almost two years.This book details the personalities and activities he observed and participated in with the Mongols. The biker lifestyle is on full display here, and the voyeuristic aspects of the book make it a fascinating read alone (and often a chilling one - though there are many examples of the old adage that crooks are not the sharpest knives in the drawer). Queen also details his personal sacrifice as well as his feeling a little divided loyalty between bikers who finally accepted him as a \\"brother\\" and his role as an agent which would ensure a lot of his \\"brothers\\" went to jail for a long, long time.This is similar to \\"No Angel\\" excepting the fact that Queen went into the Mongols alone while the agent in \\"No Angel\\" had a small crew of loyalists who were with him during his mission. Also, Queen got excellent results - a lot of his targets went away for serious prison terms. Unfortunately, the cases were weaker against the Angels in \\"No Angel\\" resulting in rather disappointing conviction and term rates.\\"Under and Alone\\" is a quick read and offers a fascinating view of undercover work as well as the insides of the outlaw motorcycle club life."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Anyone who is a fan of \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" or has some romantic idea of what \\"brotherhood\\" should read this book! It puts things in a perspective that most other books about the 1% world lack. It was a great read and you'll finish it and be wanting more in no time. Awesome first book that had the feel of sitting and talking with the author over a beer."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book was a good read. I enjoyed the way he takes the reader through the entire investigation. The highs of acquiring intel and evidence and the lows of nearly being made. from being in terrible situations to having friendships inside the club he shows how hard it is to be an undercover agent. To know that there was no fabrication of the story is quite chilling to know that he accomplished what he was able to accomplish. Very good read!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It's a nice read.

Read it and pass it on."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I saw this book and was interested because of the insight into the 1%er MC subculture. The book did not disappoint and clearly gives you a look inside their world. I managed to read it in a couple of days and basically could not set it down. That said, the author uses a pretty straightforward style that at times sounds more like a police report than a story. But what he lacks in creativity and color is more than filled in by the fascinating subject matter. I highly recommend this book if you want to see what it looks like from the inside of an outlaw motorcycle gang."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book was well written and appears factual.

Mr. Queen has an excellent writing style, and he produced a very compelling account of his time as an undercover officer as a patched member of the Mongols in California. The story he presents demonstrates the wonton and unnecessary violence that characterized the people with whom he interacted, and the very real sacrifices he made during the 2.5 year investigation. Although I can't evaluate the validity of every anecdote he presents, the entire book reads as a plausible, reasonable account of actual events. The people are presented with great detail, even sympathy at times. Mr. Queen does not make them either saints or devils. He instead presents them as real humans.I must say that the Mongols strike me as a sorry lot. Although Mr. Queen starts the volume illustrating the incredible wealth gained by Hells Angles and other Outlaw Motorcycle clubs through drug running and gun running, Mr. Queen's story recounts the hand-to-mouth existence of even Mongol national officers. These guys come across as a pack of dysfunctional losers who are as incompetent in criminal enterprises as they are with real life. The only thing they apparently have going for them is their propensity for violence. They seem to be tough, but also very, very stupid. I guess that may have been the most surprising aspect of the entire book, to be honest. I expected them to be smarter than they were.I was also surprised with how the tale of brotherhood within the Mongols MC club resonated with me. I can understand how Mr. Queen became conflicted about his goals when these loser criminals showed real sympathy for the loss of his mother while his ATF buddies didn't even express their condolences in passing. An organization that allows men to meaningfully bond has a strength that it appealing and I wish that our society encouraged this in other contexts. It is unfortunate that some of the characters described in the book had to join an outlaw motorcycle club to find it.Regardless, this is an excellent book and definitely worth your money!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I really did like this book. It told the story short, sweet, and to the point. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that in my opinion it was way too short, sweet and to the point!

Queen's assignment was clearly one of the most dangerous ones to be taken on and he's lucky he lived to tell about it. You'll find yourself finishing the novel not long after you started it, it's a page-turner for sure.You can't help but feel for Queen when he's missing his \\"real\\" family, yet dealing with the low-life biker gang members on a daily basis. As another poster suggested, I suspect Queen left out much of the illegal activities he was involved in while with the Mongols, obviously b/c of his position. My only complaint about the novel is that it wasn't longer. I enjoyed his stories very much and I'm sure there were many he left out ~ considering he was with the gang for 2 years.Other reviewers are wrong, he did not give all biker gangs a bad name, merely the ones who run criminal enterprises."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I could not put this book down. It is a rapid, riveting read. Living quite near to where most of the book took place, I will now look quite differently at some of the drunken unruly people in bars! My one criticism (and compliment)of the book is that it is too short. It could be twice as long and still hold the reader captive. There are large gaps in time where I am wondering what transpired.After reading the book it is hard not to become emotionally involved. There are so many unanswered questions: Did William Queen ever hear any feed-back about the book from any of the characters featured in the book? Is he still hidden in Plano, Texas? How are his ex-wife and children doing? Are Rocky and Domingo still in jail?It is difficult not to get attached to all the people in the book; the good, the bad and the ugly. I came away with a soft spot for some of the worst criminals and after reading it felt the same confusion that Queen expressed about the mixed emotions he felt for his brothers in the Mongols."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Have an upcoming flight needed some reading material.

Red Dog has served his time and is a free man, Queen is still hiding, always under an ever threatning death sentence.And has the culture in the Mongols changed, doubt it. Maybe William Queen \\"Billy St John\\" made the wrong choice in the end, the Mongols were his brothers and \\"loved\\" him in times of grief, the Feds couldnt care less.Readers of this book will form their own conclusions but I think \\"Billy St John\\" probably regrets his chosen course."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I was very pleased to find this book again.

A MUST READ, IF YOU LIKE BOOKS ON TRUE CRIME"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"\\"Under and Alone\\" details the undercover life of William Queen, also known as Billy St. John of the San Fernando Valley Mongol Nation biker gang. The events are true crime, a change from the typical novels I read, keeping more to accounting factual events in the late 1990's than coating the mind with generous descriptions of the environment and people as found in the fantasy or science fiction genre.As a Special Agent in the ATF (Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms), William Queen becomes involved in an investigation that will consume over 2 years of his life affecting his person in more ways than initially considered. The internal conflict to identify and relate between criminal and law enforcement will become the toughest battle. Beginning as an associate and weaving his way into the upper echelons, he befriends those whom will hopefully be brought to justice spanning numerous counts of felonious crimes. Special Agent Queen embodies a true hero bringing the sacrifices home to us who simply hear a few lines in the news.At times, it is mildly difficult to determine whether the story has become a flashback or current event, chronologically jumps around at times. As with novels of this nature, events and people are vague for individual protection and might give the reader an impression of a fragmented story.Thank you."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is a book that will keep your attention from the first page to the last.

I even grew up a in Daytona Beach, FL and thought this Motorcyle Gang stuff was just made up. \\"Gangs are for young thugs with bad parents and no jobs.\\"I was not part of this culture, but it was all around me. Bikers were always nice, very willing to help out. Even the ones with the patched up vests and the half naked women at The Iron Horse on US 1. So yeah... they got a little drunk, could be a little rowdy, but overall were seemingly good guys that were interesting to look at and looked REALLY scary.We would hear about the Outlaws down there, as well as the Mongols and Hell's Angels - not to mess with them. But, what does that really mean? These guys are in their 40s, too old for trouble. Now I know. It means business. Now those are the 1%ers - The rest are just guys and girls with enough money to get a bike.Mr. Queen did such a great job taking the reader through the terrible things that most people don't know or see as well as the sweet emotional sides of these guys that are looking for family. It felt like I was right there, a witness to his experiences. Sometimes, harrowing, sometimes sad, sometimes sweet.I won't spoil anything, but I can only imagine how angry his ex-wife must have been.This is defintiely a great read - even if you've never seen a biker."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"this is a very interesting and informative book about how dangerous motor cycle gangs and the criminal activity they are involved in.Good job Mr Queen in taking some of these outlaws off the streets."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is a great book even if your not into MC's.

However it was, it is a great read."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"\\"Under and Alone\\" by William Queen is the memoir of an undercover ATF agent and his infiltration case against a notorious Southern California Biker gang. Although most OMG (outlaw motorcycle gangs) call themselves clubs, this book delves into the infamous \\"1%\\" of the biker world, who brazenly standout from the remaining \\"99%\\" of law abiding MC's. The 1%ers are known for involvement in nearly every type of organized crime imaginable, but they are principally identified through territorial violence against rival gangs and anyone who challenges or disrespects their organization.This book provides a unique look at what was the crowning achievement of author William Queen's career in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), his role as an undercover agent (UC) in the strongest Biker gang in Southern California, The Mongols. Though the Mongols only had 350 members in 4 or 5 states at the time of this investigation (1998-2000), they still ruled the roost in the biker world in the Los Angeles area, mainly through their affiliation with the Mexican Mafia, otherwise known as \\"La Eme\\" or The M. The Mongols are primarily a Hispanic biker gang; although there are a fair number of Caucasians in their organization, they were formed in the early 1970's as a response to the Hell's Angels, who were known to often exclude minorities from their ranks.The California war between the Angels and the Mongols is perhaps one of the most infamous in the annals of OMG's, but unfortunately, this book barely even mentions the Angels, which I thought was strange considering the war which lasted from the late 70's to the mid 90's really put the Mongols in the map, as they proved they could stand up to the strongest and most known MC in the world. Although I definately enjoyed this book, I felt it to be a bit thin for a two year investigation, especially considering Queen was required to write daily reports passed on to his fellow agent John Ciccone. For obvious reasons, a book about this type of gang investigation (the subject of which is still strong and active) would have to have some discretion in order to protect the people involved as well as ATF tactics for infiltrating OMGs. There is alot of interest here, yet the Mongols who Queen writes of appear more like strung out thugs, hustling to get high, rather than the practioners of a crime syndicate that would eventually expand over seas and fight against other OMGs for turf (the Mongols went global after this investigation).This is understandable considering it takes place in an \\"interwar\\" period, as there is only one MC beef in Queen's time with gang. These periods are usually the most significant in determining the status of a gang, but Agent Queen's investigation occurred at what could be called a down time in the history of the Mongols. That isn't to say that the book is uneventful, as there is drug dealing, weapons trafficking and macho violence galore, but for a viewer of FX's biker drama \\"Sons of Anarchy\\", I was expecting a bit more intrigue and mental finesse than was displayed by the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols that Queen \\"patched into.\\"I realized that \\"SOA\\" is a good show, but it is still a fictional drama series, as the events depicted in Kurt Sutter's show have a basis in reality, yet what occurs in 4 seasons of SOA might happen in the entire life of an old time biker in the Hell's Angels. The Sons of Anarchy are clearly modeled after the Hell's Angels, while the rival Hispanic gang is called \\"The Mayans\\", an obvious analogue for the Mongols. The chapter president who ruled over Queen (aka Billy St. John) was named Alvarez, which is also the name of the leader in the fictitious Mayans, whose gang has an on again, off again war with the Sons, just like the Angels/Mongols feud.The investigation that Queen and case agent (handler) John Ciccone conducted is considered one of the best on OMG's ever done, but Queen still admits quite frequently that the bikers who became his \\"brothers\\" were quite slovenly and strung out on meth and booze. Even on the club \\"runs\\" to various places out west, their bikes are so poorly maintained that many broke down. The SFV Mongol chapter was still very dangerous and Queen's life was constantly on the line, yet it is clear that they were not the best the Mongols had to offer in terms of having their act together. It could be a case of breaking the weakest link to destroy the whole chain.Ironically, the Mongols ranks swelled after this investigation, nearly doubling their numbers, which renewed the war with the Angels in 2002 and started a beef with La Eme over new president Doc Cavazos policy of using non biker hispanic gangsters to expand the club. There is a great episode of Gangland about the Mongols (which can be viewed on You tube), as their members seem as brazen as ever. It is probably no coincidence that Law enforcement made 60 arrests (including Cavazos) in 2008, furthering the battle that Agent Queen started in 1998."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Guess I should seek a shrink for counsel as I find myself fascinated with the Outlaw MC gang lifestyle.Hard to believe something like it can exist in today's high tech world with dominating anti crime forces.Pretend you're a biker, get in the gang, rat em' all out and come out alive.

This seems to be the case here: \\"Gimme Shelter\\" led to Sonny Barger's \\"Hell's Angel\\" which led to the \\"Gangland\\" television series and then to searching Amazon.com for books about outlaw biker clubs, starting with \\"Under and Alone\\".The first chapter of this book was such an effective teaser that it actually fooled me into believing the book was ghost-written due to the author not surviving his undercover assignment ... it worked, because I couldn't put it down.The thought of a law enforcement officer having the courage to take such an assignment is one thing ... to follow through with that assignment and actually become a full-patched member of such an organization is simply amazing. Even more impressive is the fact that Queen does such an excellent job of taking the reader along with him ... a true \\"fly on the wall\\" perspective throughout the book.Every chapter contains moments where you feel as if Queen wouldn't survive his assignment and you almost breathe a sigh of relief when oftentimes, a random moment of good fortune is all that saves him.What makes \\"Under and Alone\\" such a good read is that the action never lets up ... it is nothing but a continuous series of battles: the battle to hide his true identity from a group in which every member is a potential murderer, the battle to portray himself as outlaw biker material yet not participate in criminal activity, the battle of being a father to his kids and maintain their safety during/after the assignment, the struggle of actually developing a fraternal relationship with men who he will eventually be sending to prison and the constant battle with the expected ineptitude of the agency responsible for keeping him alive. The best battle of all, however, is the continuous grief Queen endures from one particular Mongol ... \\"Red Dog\\".I found myself constantly flipping to the pictures in order to place a face with the name of those Mongols he writes about ... even \\"Red Dog\\".The book left me with a feeling of appreciation that there are people out there willing to do such dangerous work voluntarily. My only regret is that there is understandably no \\"where are they now\\" chapter because I would really like to know how certain Mongols personally felt about Queen and the success of his undercover work."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I get that it takes a certain amount of ego and cockiness to pull off this kind of a sham, but how stressful a life like that must be! While I admire the undertaking Queen did, I did and still do keep asking myself why someone would want to do this. It seems like a heckofa lot of money was spent on this 2 year \\"investigation.\\" American courts need to revamp the requirements needed for putting bad guys away. Miranda is just too expensive. This is a very unsettling book for me as a \\"victim\\" of our American justice (?) system, as a taxpayer seeing how money is doled out to investigations of this type that may or may not reap results, and at the absurdity put upon ATF agents in the whole keeping up the demeanor, but-you-can't-do-drugs-lest-you-go-to-the-hospital requirement. What a joke! It's like the good guys WANT the bad guys to keep harassing and brutalizing innocent victims by putting absurd stipulations/rules on the very folks trying to protect them."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen was an ATF agent who spent two and a half years living under cover as Billy St. John, a member of the San Fernando Valley Chapter of the Mongols, an international motorcycle gang. In his two years working the case, he \\"patched in\\" (became an official member of the gang) and worked his way up the ranks to an executive position, gaining unprecedented access to the inner workings of the gang, including its finances and official records. His case eventually led to the indictment of 53 Mongols on counts ranging from illegal possession of firearms to drug trafficking and murder.While it's interesting to see how Queen worked himself out of predicament after predicament, weaving lies together to cover himself, you know he's going to make it out alright simply by the fact that he lived to write the book. So there's not a much tension in those moments in retrospect. To me, the interest of the book is in learning about the outlaw biker culture, and in the moral dilemma Queen faces when he has to testify against his \\"brothers.\\" While he knows he's doing the right thing, he's also grown close to many of his fellow gang members, and he can sense that they really care for him too.The writing sometimes lapses into the sort of gun-ho speak you find in war novels, but the story tears along at a ferocious pace and is in the end a quick, easy, fun read. And Queen should be commended for the sacrifices he made and the danger he repeatedly put himself in to serve his country."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Excellent book. It is well written. Few people know the difference between a motorcyclist and a biker. His book gives a view of motorcycle clubs from both the angle of being a police office and being a biker, a view that the public doesn't see. I have ridden motorcycles all my life. I have hung out with bikers and motorcycle clubs since I was big enough to walk. I am a retired police officer and a biker and have seen some things from the angle the author has seen it from. I have never worked under cover, and never cared to. He went much farther into his work than most police officers would care to, especially if they have a family of any kind to worry about. I salute the author in his boldness and daring in his work."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Besides keeping you interested until the end, this book does one other thing - it teaches you bravery. I know you know what bravery is, but do you know what bravery is?In this day and age when a word like that can only make sense when associated with far away lands of Arabic speaking people, deserts and terrorist actions, this book will bring you back to American soil, to the cities we live in, to the streets we walk on, the roads we drive on, our own back yard. Bravery exists here and is made of self sacrifice and duty.In the pages of this book you will discover what it takes a man to overcome the impossible, to expose himself to danger every day in order to accomplish his mission.This is the true story of a hero who sacrifices himself daily for two years as an undercover agent of the FBI to bring down one of the worst motorcycle gangs in the history of America. I guarantee it'll keep you thrilled and the story will touch you deep inside and leave a mark.-by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Under and Alone is a gripping, white-knuckle ride.This is the story of William Queen, an ATF agent who spent 2 years undercover inside the notorious Mongol motorcycle gang.Queen's tale is suspenseful, horrifying, funny and at times endearing. With gut wrenching honesty, Queen shows us the outlaw life of motorcycle gangs. It's not a pretty picture - violence and drugs reign. We are with him as he struggles in his assignment. Finding himself caught between two worlds, Queen is in a constant state of nervous tension, balancing his fear of being found out with his burning desire to put these cold blooded killers behind bars.Throughout Queen is honest with us. He paints complex portraits of the gang memebers - some he even remembers fodly. A must-read for everyone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book was well written, a great story about an HONEST law enforcement officer(in a world that often times doesn't think one exists),and the, day to day beyond the call of duty, perils of Billy Queen's time undercover as amemeber of the ATF. You will not be disapointed with this book. I finished this book in a day and a half( I never read any book that fast) because I couldn't put it down and I had to know what happened next.I can't wait to see the movie! The release date is in 2008. I, a deputy sheriff myself, recommend this book highly to anyone considering a career as a cop ad is thinking about wanting to go undercover, someone contemplating joining a biker gang,and everyone else out there for that matter! God Bless, Don"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I loved it. The writing is crisp and concise, and the \\"plot\\" (aka, real events) move along quickly.

I hope Red Dog stays in jail for a long time.Outstanding Book!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"From beginning to end I could not put this book down. This booked grabed me and would not let go. The only time I put this book down was to sleep. This is a great insight into a motorcycle gangs lifestyle. Billy Quenn is a modern day dragon slayer. Very intense!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Even if you know nothing about Motorcycle gangs or have little interest in them (like myself), this book is absolutely addicting. I just read on the internet that Warner Bros. has already got a movie deal w/ Mel Gibson as the main character- Billy Queen. Fuqua to direct.READ THIS BOOK! You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book is about an undercover agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, William Queen, worming his way into full membership status of the vicious Mongols motorcycle club in an attempt to shut it down through convictions stemming from purchases of illegal weapons and narcotics. Although Mr. Queen's bravery is unquestionable, the end results just don't seem to justify the extreme time, effort and expense involved.Although I thought the author left some questions and situations unanswered and unresolved, the book was entertaining and might make a good movie. What I especially enjoyed about the book was that it was not a one-sided affair. It was not a black-and-white good-vs-evil story. The book describes well the comraderie and human side of some of the Mongols as well as those of Mr. Queen. The best example of this was when Mr. Queen's mother died. The Mongols expressed their sympathy and showed respect to William en mass, while not a single ATF agent, even those with whom he had the strongest bonds, expressed an ounce of concern.The book also showed the ATF's bureaucratic BS that William had to contend with while trying to remain undercover, do a job and stay alive and healthy. All this certainly depicts William's courage and focus. It's a shame that he did not receive the support from his own agency that he needed. To his ATF managers, William was nothing more than a number, a pawn to be thrown to the wolves if the investigation proved fruitless or went otherwise bad. His dedication and courage speaks volumes about his character.The book is hard-hitting, direct and full of human issues. It describes well the danger and violence brought forth by gangs such as this as well as the innermost thoughts and feelings of those who try and stop them. It's a good read and one that you'll not want to put down."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"As one who has LIVED the LIFE for over 30 of my 53 years, I can personally testify that the OMG lifestyle description in this book is right on, good or bad, this is pretty much the way it is.My main problem with this book is that Agent Queen could really make it from Hang-around to Prospect to Patchholder Mongol in this daily environment of violence, crime, drug & alcohol abuse, and sex and maintain his ethical and moral legal criteria. The man definitely has some big stones, but are they THAT big.I personally had a few brief brushes with the Mongols & Vagos both back in the early '80's, and it sounds like things haven't changed, but I believe there's a LOT of this tale that got left out."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Great book, with a large amount of information. One thing in particular I liked was how the emotional and psychological impact of the undercover assigment was expressed. Excellent, fast reading."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"SA William (Billy) Queen's 2 1/2 years of investigating the Mongols motorcycle club as an undercover ATF agent is pure guts, grit, and courage. Of the many things Billy proved over the course of his investigation perhaps the most important was that such clubs CAN BE infiltrated by dedicated and well supported law enforcement officers.This is a well-written, fast-paced page turner that once started simply cannot be put down until finished. Queen reveals both the Mongols and other outlaw motorcycle clubs for what they are behind all the media-hype romance...brutes on bikes whose only regard is for their own well-being and whose only respect is for their club patch.Kudos to Billy Queen for riding the hard trail and bringing down some truly bad guys - his book is a testament to Honor, Loyalty, and Duty of the highest order in the circles of professional law enforcement."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Forget all other books about fighting the always growing problem of crime. This book covers it all. You are taken very deep undercover and exposed to the real crime world. ATF Agent Queen does an outstanding job at expressing everything that he was feeling during his investigation. His fears, his determination and his concerns for all those around him are just unmatchable. I couldn't put this book down and I guarantee that you won't be able to either. I give it 10 stars!!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Doesn't get bogged down in a lot of details; however, because of this, it feels a little 'bare bones'...but this is probably because of disclosure issues and confidential materials."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen spent 28 months undercover with the Mongols motorcycle group - feared more than Hells Angels. His bravery and \\"street intelligence\\" are incredible. Drugs, illegal weapons, gang-rape, witness intimidation, brutal beatings, and motorcycle theft were the gang's most common unlawful activities.Introduction to the group was via an informant who wanted to get back at the Mongols; unfortunately, the informant also let the Mongols know what she wanted to accomplish, leading them to suspect Queen. To gain stature and prevent being exposed as an ATF agent, he had to fake snorting meth, and appear ready to participate in a gang rape (luckily the intended victims did not show up). Final acceptance required passing a background check using his Social Security #, VA records, last five years' W-2 forms, criminal records, high-school records, and relatives - in this case all made up by the ATF.Queen reported several instances of the gang's criminality and brutality: 1)A fellow prospective member who changed his mind about membership had to play Russian roulette to get out. 2)Members wanting out had to have their Mongol gang tattoo burned off. 3)One member had been convicted of child molesting his sister's children - because she turned him in he was plotting to kill both her and the children. (Queen managed to thwart those crimes.) 4)Another member, unable to redeem his pawned motorcycle, wanted to kill the pawn shop owner (again Queen was able to avoid this crime).Shortly after becoming accepted, Queen became chapter Secretary-Treasurer, replacing the functionally-illiterate incumbent. This afforded Queen (and the government) detail about the group's activities that otherwise would not have been available.Queen paid a steep price for his undercover status - not only did he have to risk his life daily and subject himself to a highly destructive lifestyle (drinking, fighting, fast riding), his girlfriend dropped him, he missed many opportunities to be with his sons, and ultimately they were moved far away from him as part of a protective relocation.The prosecutorial rewards, unfortunately, were not commensurate, in my opinion: Seventy illegal firearms, two kilos of cocaine, significant amounts of marijuana and meth, and 53 convictions. (Queen only elaborates on one sentence - \\"Red Dog\\" - one of the worst members - received only a three year sentence.) This is not a criticism of anyone - just the depressing reality of how difficult it can be to attack organized crime.Two years later, the Mongols and Hells Angels gangs met in Laughlin, NV - and two people died. Unfortunately the Mongols did not go out of business - no fault of Queen's. I only wish we had applied his talents to anti-terrorism!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I have read several books on this subject. This is the very best!! Some have complained about the writing style, but this book was written by a former undercover agent, not an author. It is a very easy read and gives good insight into both sides of the law. The good on both sides, and the bad."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I found this story very entertaining. A hard book to put down! However, there are points where you have to question if there is some fiction thrown in the story or weather Queen is being completely truthful about his involvement in certain circumstances. None the less, it is a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book is the true account of an undercover cop who infiltrated a motorcycle gang and became a full-fledged member. The action is nonstop; the things this man endured to bring this group to justice is amazing! He must be an incredibly strong-willed person to have stuck this out for over two years and retained his sense of purpose. Thanks to men like Bill Queen, we are all safer."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book was an awesome read, I couldn't put it down. I have much respect for William Queen and the life he lead as an ATF Agent. He does an excellent job in taking the reader into the deep seeded underworld of the Mongol Nation. Special Agent Queen risks his life as Billy St.John in order to put some of America's most violent thugs behind bars. This is a must read for anyone interested in the happenings of the 1%er world."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"One has to admire the guts of William Queen - delving into a horribly violent and crazy Motorcycle Gang for two years to collect evidence to use against them. The writing is fast paced and the book is a quick read (4 or 5 hours tops). I found it a fascinating look at a totally different culture - the biker mafia culture. It was sometimes very scary and I can't believe that William Queen last two years. He made a great sacrifice (more than I would have asked for) to clean up the streets. Overall, a must read."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"There are few if any books that I've read in one afternoonj/evening sitting, but I just couldn't put this book down. William Queen, aka: \\"Prospect Billy\\" tells a hair raising narrative about life in the Mongols motorcycle gang as an undercover ATF agent. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire read. \\"Riveting\\" would be an understatement. Probably one of the most dangerous undercover assingments ever attempted. I can't wait until this story is made into a movie. Well done, William Queen!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who spent two years undercover as a member of the LA-centered Mongol Motorcycle Club. The Mongols were/are one of the most violent gangs in the country, motivated not by profit but by sheer mayhem, blood and beer. Queen becomes Billy St. James, grows his beard, and slowly makes his way up from Prospect to fully-patched member, then to Vice-President, of his chapter. Along the way, he gathers evidence about the many crimes planned and executed by the members of the Mongols (whose colorful names include Rancid, Panhead, and Red Dog). The book is a fast read, and Queen, thankfully, avoids any pop-psych analysis of the violent men with whom he rode. Nevertheless, he comments on some interesting aspects of human nature: he found his Mongol brothers far more sympathetic to the death of his mother than his fellow ATF agents, and he feels pangs of guilt as he records the conversations of men he knows would give their lives to protect him. The motorcycle life is a hard one, especially for women, who are considered property of the men and are frequently beaten. Queen describes one incident where he sowed up the broken, bleeding face of a beaten woman (he was a trained medic in Vietnam). The toll on Queen's family is high, and one gets the feeling that after writing this book, Queen himself will always be in danger. Even though the reader knows how the book will end - with Billy St. James turning back into ATF Agent Queen and testifying against his former brothers - Under and Alone remains suspenseful. Like the lion-tamer who defies death time and time again, Queen / St. James was able to keep his secret longer than he and the ATF ever thought possible, and risked death almost daily doing so. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Although as a cop in Chicago I moreso work with street gangs, I found this to be a realistic and fascinating book.

It was fantastic. The book is engaging in that it provides an \\"insider's peek\\" into the world of the nation's most dangerous motorcycle gang. Under and Alone is a riviting page turner. I found myself chewing on my nails as I read tale after tale of Queen's numerous brushes with almost certain discovery of his true identity as a cop--discovery that would lead to his instantaneous death. Finally, it has heart as Queen shows how he became close to the Mongol members and began to see them as his brothers. Queen was often torn between his growing loyalty to the Mongols, who often showed him more love than anyone else in his life, and his duty as a cop to convict criminals. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is an astounding work.

To do that by immersing yourself in a culture of brutality requires fearlessness and total dedication.I found this book fascinating. Queen holds nothing back as he recounts the two years he spent with the Mongols, who are one of the most violent biker gangs in the U.S. We see his struggle to maintain his sense of self, while living as someone else. I was particularly struck by his inner battle with turning on these people who had become friends. Few people are inherently bad or good. Despite the violent and often horrible acts these bikers committed, they shared a stronger bond than many families and spouses ever experience. They truly loved one another.Queen's dedication to this case is astounding. By telling his story, he exposes the truth behind the overly glamorized biker world."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It all started with a show.

I wanted to read something that would allow me to understand what being a biker is like. I picked up this book since it had such high ratings and I loved every page of it.Years ago, I had read Donnie Brasco, and I hate to say it but Under and Alone was better.

This book takes you deep inside the life of a 1% motorcycle gang. William Queen must have balls of steel, you fear for him throughout the book. The twists that go along with leading a double life of a law enforcement agent and a 1% patch wearer is enthralling. For what Billy St John does to endure the probation period, to rising through the ranks is beyond incredible. The lifestyle of the 1% biker can be romantic from the outside, but the things in this book prove they are a criminal empire. The inner turmoil that Billy St John feels for his Mongol brothers and the need for Agent Queen to get the evidence needed is what makes this book so good.

Not to mention, I'm not much of a reader!

I have to admit I read the book wanting to get an \\"inside\\" look at the daily life of the Mongols.The one thing I will always remember about the book is when Billy Queens Mother died. He stated in the book NOT ONE SINGLE person with ATF offered so much as a kind word, when he left for the funeral or when he returned.That was his Mother for Gods sake !! And they called themselves friends? Apparently that was all they did was \\"call it\\".The ones supposed to be so evil walked up to him and hugged his neck and said \\"I'm sorry about your Momma Billy, I love you brother.

Not that I would want to be."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"In any civilized society, most individuals play a productive part in that society. Some people have a greater impact on society than others. However, sometimes it is easy to forget about the sacrifices one makes, especially when their sacrifices are as transparent as with the life of an undercover law enforcement officer.Under and Alone is an excellent story about an undercover BATF agent named Billy Queen. Agent Queen, a Vietnam Veteran and a motorcycle enthusiast, has the opportunity to go undercover to try and infiltrate the Mongol Motorcycle gang. Agent Queen does so under the alias Billy St. John. The book is an excellent account of the operation from the planning steps right through the trials of the various motorcycle gang members. Agent Queen does a great job telling the story of the tense moments being introduced to the gang by a confidential informant, the harrowing months as a probationary member of the gang, the triumph of becoming a \\"full patch\\" member of the gang, and finally the mixed emotions of testifying against his friends in the gang. However, what I think made the book special was the glimpse it offers the public of the sacrifices law enforcement officers make. The life of Billy St. John/Agent Queen was at the mercy of the gang. When the gang said they were going to a rally, that meant Agent Queen went as well. In the end, this meant too much time away from his family. When he was with this kids, he wasn't the clean cut Agent Queen, he was the filthy biker Billy St. John.Before I picked up this book, I really expected an action packed true crime story. I was quite surprised at the emotions involved in this story. The writing in this book is quite excellent. Agent Queen was able to write the story so that you felt the same highs and the crushing blows that Queen/St. John felt. The book was a easy read that I had a hard time putting down.One of the great things I liked about the book is the fact that Agent Queen did not paint the Mongols as the scum of the earth. There were some that were portrayed in quite the negative light, but for the most part, he portrayed the Mongols as good people who walked on the opposite side of the law than he did. These men and women that he rode with were his friends. This is evidenced in a scene in the book where Agent Queen's mother dies. The reactions of the Mongols and fellow ATF agents shocked me.I found the ending of the book quite anticlimactic. I do not fault Agent Queen with this. It is just sometimes the truth isn't that exciting.If you want a great story about life as a law enforcement officer or you want to see the inside of a Motorcycle Gang, this is the book for you. Overall, I have to say this is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book is a very gripping and compelling look at undercover law enforcement work. It outs you in the boots of a veteran ATF agent who sacrificed his family life for over 2 years to hang out with one of the most violent motorcycle gangs around.His close calls of being found out and tests before being fully \\"patched in\\" will keep you on the edge of your seat. This shows an inside look at undercover work and how it can play with your emotions and second guess your true identity. The struggles of interacting with his family and regular society and other police looking like a gangster and trying to keep his true identity hidden from his own gang keeps this story intense emotionally.I looked forward to reading this book and finishing it each day at lunch but at the end of the book I didn't want the action to end."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Billy Queen is clearly an amazingly smart and tough guy. His tale of inflitrating the Mongrols, moving from 'Hang Around' to 'Prospect' to Treasurere and then Vice President of the local chapter is fascinating and well written. And it will quickly disabuse you of any notion that the the Mongols are OK guys have chosen their own path. While some people may have been OK when they joined, Billy makes clear the gang and its members are all to happy to hurt and kill with little or no reason.Things the book does really well: Give a feel for day to day life in the gang, outline historical background to the Mongols/Hells Angels feud, give a sense of Billy's double life- knowing his gang friends would kill him at the drop of the hat, and that a large chunk of ATF would rather see everything he'd risked his life for throw away then chance the smallest public embarrassment.The things I found lacking: Would have to liked to know even more about the gangs structure and the relationship between the head chapter (Mother) and the local chapters, would have liked to see more detailed sketches on even more of the members. Still, these are pretty trivials issues.If you are interested in motorcycle gangs this book is required reading."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I'd bet from reading this book that alot of these Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs have been and are currently being infiltrated at various levels,by undercover police.There seemed to be in the book, alot of paranoia among the Mongol members from government agents in their ranks.I'm glad that there are still police out there that will take such dangerous assignments.It took Queen about a year and a half to build up the Motorcycle Clubs' confidence and he actually rose to the position of Mongol treasurer.I noticed however how alot of the poverty stricken Mongols rapidly gravitated toward Agent Queen and his \\"deep pockets\\" which would have aroused the suspicions of smarter type criminals,(if there even is such a thing)even considering Queen had been in the group for a year and a half.Too much money coming too fast that buys into about any criminal enterprise equals \\"STING\\".When something seems to be too good to be true it probably isn't.I admired the way Queen used the Mongols greed against them.Queen became sort of a \\"daddy\\" for them and their criminal enterprises and toward the end ,the Mongols seemed like kids asking for their allowance thus adding to their well deserved jail stints.You'd think one of the Mongols might have asked,\\"Wait a minute,Queen(or St. John) sells high-tech electronic equipment for an Avionics firm,maybe he's using some of it on us\\"But also remember how many stores are robbed right in front of a security camera with full lighting and witnesses.Greed is almost never rational though?Most of the victims of these Motorcycle gangs are other motorcyclists(loner types) too often non-affiliated with a gang and therefore wide open to be a victim of groups like the Mongols.It greatly deflated my image of the fearless tattoed lone wolf cyclist, who challenges the world and its ideals.Probably from reading this book his\\"mission\\" ends rapidly as he is found dead or unconscious along the road and his bike confiscated by gangs like the Mongols.His hot-Harley honey also confiscated by the Mongols.Everyone talks about doing something about \\"bullies\\" but few to none ever do anything about them.Queen definitely did and it's good to know there are people like him out there."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I have always been fascinated about biker gangs and this book was easily the best book I have read about undercover operations and the information about one of the worst biker gangs ever. The detail by the author made it hard for me to put it down and I am not a huge reader. I was truly riveted. I highly recommend this book over other biker gang books that I have read by far."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Being a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang myself, as defined by the State of California, I loved this book. Finished it in one day.Did you know the State of Calif. thinks every group with three patches on their vests is an outlaw? That means Police (Blue Knights), Firemen, (Red Knights), and the Christian Motorcycle Association are all outlaws. And we let them make decisions for us????????????? Great book!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen has great big brass ones, to have not only associated with these criminals, but to have patched in to one of the most notorious and violent motorcycle gangs this side of the Hell's Angels. As a special agent of the Beaureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, he managed to fake his way to the top of the ranking officers in the Mongols Motorcycle Club without actually having to snort coke or methamphetamine, or commit murder, which are usually required before one achieves full patch status. The emotional turmoil he had to withstand while testifying against the brothers who's respect he spent over two years earning will put a lump in your throat."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"A very interesting story of a different nature. I couldn't put it down! There were a lot of holes, though, where the author was unable to fill in the blanks due to a security kind of nature, I am sure. This book did give me an insight into the gang culture, and it is not a pretty sight. It also made me see that my job isn't as bad as I sometimes feel it is! To do what this cop did is a true act of incredible bravery. If you like reading true stories that show a different kind of life than most of us can imagine, this is it."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This man is truly a hero. This book tells the story of how he penetrated one of the most dangerous motorcycle gangs in the world (even became a full patch member and holding an office in the club) and brought many of them to justice. This story is phenomenal because it shows not only the bad side of these clubs, but also the love and loyalty that club members show each other. He could have portrayed his \\"brothers\\" in the Mongol gang as 100% evil. But he didn't. He was with them long enough to realize that some of them were really no different than he was. Some of them were closer to him than the people he worked with at the ATF. Bottom line, very very good book. Well written and extremely personal. I highly advise you to pick up this book. But once you pick it up, you won't even think about putting it down."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. It tells the true story of an ATF agent infltrating the most violent outlaw motorcycle gang. The story of the effects of this operation over the time period are compeling. THe devistation that it brings to his family and his social life are heart breaking. This comes as a highly recommended book for anyone who likes a story about the violence and love that can be had among people who are violent, even this story shows that people truely have hearts."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"The most important thing that can be said is that the reader is almost sure to be entertained, even to the extent that he will be unable to perform other tasks until he has finished a chapter. The writing style is straightforward and believable and describes the kind of sensational gangsterism and criminality that American pop culture constantly tries to synthesize.Eventually you start feeling like subject Billy Queen, as the constant criminal activity, violence, and drug/alcohol abuse start to wash over you and hardly register. But Queen manages to make each episode fresh and exciting, building to his being fully patched in as a member of the club despite several near-deadly misses.The only quarrel I have with the book is that Queen is reluctant to admit mistakes or indiscretions that he committed during his 28 months in the club. Spending that much time in such a hardcore criminal organization was sure to entail some drug use, gang beatings, etc. that he was forced to participate in. And also, as hard as he tried, he must have made some bad decisions. He mentioned many dicey situations, but he always seemed to miraculously escape from having to do anything illegal or immoral. If that was actually the case, then he truly had a guardian angel watching over him.Although I wish he had been more level in his reporting, \\"Under and Alone\\" still is a fantastic, believable read that gives a real glimpse into the criminal underworld that we love to romanticize."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I often go on tour with bands and every year I'm on the lookout for a book that will keep me riveted as I try to read in noisy and distracting situations. If your needs are similar, I cannot recommend a book more highly than William Queen's harrowing, white-knuckled account of his adventures infiltrating the Mongols motorcycle gang. The storytelling is tense and often pretty coarse (maybe even a little sensational) which kept the pages turning for me. The book is filled with the most unbelievable array of characters that seem crazier than any even Hollywood could dream up and the events unfold at an increasingly breakneck pace.But aside from all the vicarious thrills to be had by reading about the outlaw ways of Queen and his Mongol brothers, there is a real emotional core to this book that was just as compelling for me. The conflicting feelings of loyalty the author developed over the course of the investigation made for powerful reading and I couldn't hold back the tears when he spoke of the toll the whole situation took on the well-being of the children of the gang members in addition to his deteriorating relationship with his own young sons. This is a first-rate nonfiction potboiler with heart."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen, ATF agent goes deep undercover into the Mongols motorcycle gang as Billy St John. Queen recounts his time as a prospect, getting full-patch in into the Mongols, holding Mongol officer status as secretary-treasurer and even vice-president of the San Fernando Valley Chapter. He does his best to steer away from committing crimes and has to come up with excuses on the fly as to why we can't participate so as not to jeopardize his standing as a federal agent. All the while putting up with early abuse and secretly recording conversations and gathering intel into the crimes committed by such clubs.Queen becomes so entwined into the gang, that he begins having a hard time personally telling which life he wants, Billy St John or William Queen. After two and a half years, Queen finally has to drop the hammer to save his own descent. He's deeply touched by the events following his aunt's death in which the Mongols show more concern, condolensces, and care about Billy than any faction of his fellow ATF agents, even his partner Ciccone.Unfortunately, while the book is very good, there is organization and topic coverage that is just too messy to warrant a higher rating. Do we really need to be inform that he \\"back his straight pipes up to the curb\\" every time he went somewhere? The first few chapters are just terribly disorganized and all over the place rather than using a better thought out background into the operation. You get tired of hearing him debate internally about throwing out the assignment when certain situations arise because it's a conflict of his law enforcement training (and rightly so).Overall, this is a great story and should be read. However, the format of the book is low and needed better organization. I'd like to have learned more about certain gang friends of his and possibly more on the aftermath of the court cases on individuals like Red Dog and Evel. Great story, bad formatting. Good selection of photos included in the middle of the book too. Former Mongol member Ruben Cavazos' bookHonor Few, Fear None: The Life and Times of a Mongolis easily counteracted by this telling of life as a Mongol."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I absolutley loved this book. I could not put it down. It was incredible to be able to read the very thoughts of someone who went through the things that William Queen did. I am also amazed at some of the things that he had the nerve to write, like about the ATF and how they were unsupportive of him at times throughout the assignment. He did not hold back how he really felt and if he is still employed by the ATF, the things he wrote about them could have been career altering. Of course, the things he wrote about the Mongols couldn't have scored him anymore points either. I'm just picturing the guys sitting in their prison cells, reading his book. :)The one thing I wish he would have put more in about was how it affected his family however it is possible that he wanted to keep them out of things as much as possible. The poor kids had to move and assume new identies as a result of this whole thing."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is a book difficult to lay down.

Don't these guys know that to be cool on a bike you need to be 50, have a white color job and spend more time on skin moisturizing then drug procurement. Anyway this is one heck of a book. It is not because the author does such a good job, to be fair he many have the bravery of ten men but he has some difficulty in the written word. This small quibble aside, this was a good old fashion page turner. The exploits he describes in the book are worthy of a Hollywood rendering.The one thing I did wonder about was how did he not engage is some unlawful or maybe just sorta unlawful acts. I mean how can you be taken seriously by a bunch of hard core criminals and not partake in some of the action. Outside of this, I just could not put the book down. The life that is detailed is one that I completely did not think existed today in the U.S.A, how does this type of criminal gang go around without more public attention? If you are interested in non fiction or true crime then you will just love this book. Go ahead and make his day."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"What an excellent book.

I do believe that if discoverd he would have been killed. I don't believe for a second that he did 28 months with out ever doing drugs seeing how drugs were such a HUGE part of this chapter's life style. I also believe that IF the HAMC really wanted to, they would have wiped out the mongols just like they took care of the Rock machine in Canada. It seems to me the chapter he was with were a bunch of total loosers hell.......most didn't even have a decient motorcycle. I dont think that chapter would have survived anyways with Drugs distroying them.But like I said for an enjoyable read it is well written and I would recomend it, but dont think for a minute you will walk away with knowledge of 1% workings"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"When i first heard about this book it piqued my interest. subject matter being somewhat close to home living in southern california and knowing some of the Mongols. what impressed me was the immersion into the life complete isolation from friends and family.i sat and read this book today, it was not a long or complex read. the plot moves quickly and i found it extremely hard to put down. i felt for queen and the choices he had to make. i question his drug usage and involvement in violence and wonder what really happened. i also find it hard to believe that somebody with his background and history is so opposed to getting his hands dirty for the sake of his undercover persona. i feel that he probably toned it down so as not to look like a psycho. however whatever the motivations it is a compelling and worthwhile read and definitely suggested for any biker or some such."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, Queen easly takes us through his life while under cover. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"A truly fascinating book that takes you into the lives of some of America's most dangerous criminals. Well written and filled with intense moments you feel like you're there with Billy Queen as he goes through all the steps to infiltrate the gane. At the end you feel his emotion when he testifies against his former friends.Note: This book is not recommended for children. Treat it like a PG-13 movie"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"From the minute I read the first page, I knew this book would grab me and not let go. There aren't that many books that do, but this one sure did. Billy \\"St. John\\" Queen is an amazing guy - what fortitude it took to ride with the Mongols, \\"patch in\\" and live to tell about it. For those of us that know nothing about motorcycle clubs, it was an eye opener to hear about the club's goings on - from the hang-around stage to the prospect phase to actually \\"patching in\\" as a full-fledged member. The stories Billy tells are mind-blowing - It would have been some ride to have been a fly on the wall through all of it. The most amazing thing about this book is the human element to it - Billy's deep feelings for his brother members - both Mongols and ATF - and the mind conflicts that racked him constantly, not to mention the havoc it played on his personal life with his sons, his girlfriend, his family. The best line in the book is on page 258 which sums up the entire human aspect of it - Billy writes, \\"I'd not only witnessed it and lived it - I had FELT it.\\" Billy writes very well and the book is thoroughly understandable from a layman's point of view. Billy - if you ever read this - God Bless you always. Ride on brother!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I heard about this book through a review in a magazine I had read. I went out and bought the book right before I left to Colorado to look at schools with my sister. This is book truly a work of art. The reading is so easy and it captivates you from the minute you flip to the first page. The book does an excellent job of setting you in the exact moment and it conveys feelings the author is having as well. It is almost impossible to believe that this is a true story. The events encountered in this book are truly unbelievable. This book is nothing short of entertaining and amazing. You will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I could not put this book down. It is a rapid, riveting read. Living quite near to where most of the book took place, I will now look quite differently at some of the drunken unruly people in bars! My one criticism (and compliment)of the book is that it is too short. It could be twice as long and still hold the reader captive. There are large gaps in time where I am wondering what transpired.After reading the book it is hard not to become emotionally involved. There are so many unanswered questions: Did William Queen ever hear any feed-back about the book from any of the characters featured in the book? Is he still hidden in Plano, Texas? How are his ex-wife and children doing? Are Rocky and Domingo still in jail?It is difficult not to get attached to all the people in the book; the good, the bad and the ugly. I came away with a soft spot for some of the worst criminals and after reading it felt the same confusion that Queen expressed about the mixed emotions he felt for his brothers in the Mongols."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"What a great read. The amount of courage it took to infiltrate a violent gang is just incredible. To become and function as a \\"Patched\\" member is on the borderline of insanity, Mr Queen did both and walked away to tell about it. I read this book in one sitting, not being able to put it down. His many confrontations with gang members where his life is on the line keep the pages turning and wondering how or if he'll make it through."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I couldn't put this book down! An insightful look into the life of an undercover cop and the violent ways of motorcycle gangs. I praise Billy Queen for what he did and am thankful he didn't come away with a split personality. What he did would drive an average man mad!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"If there is one word to describe this book, it's wow. This book is intriguing, eye-opening, exciting, touching, and mesmerizing. One of the best books I've ever read.Billy McQueen, ATF agent, joins the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang as Billy St. Jean, giving up his personal life, living in certain danger, and even fighting ATF bureaucracy in order to prosecute the toughest and dangerous motorcycle gang around (the only gang to humble the Hell's Angels).This has all the qualities and excitement of any action movie. What separates this from a movie is that this was all real. The sacrifices this man made are amazing.He details the pain of initiation, the side stepping of the issue of drug taking, the constant harassment of the police, the constant threat of being outed, and climbing the ladder of the Mongol hierarchy. He delves the life of Mongol outlaw, the surprisingly strict Mongol organizational structure, the violent crimes they initiate, their history, their significance, their rituals.He transforms the reader, as he explains his own transformation, to a full-fledged Mongol officer. He shows the extremely volatile, yet sometimes sympathetic nature of being in a motorcycle gang. He both explains the dichotomy of people who both love Mongol Billy St. Jean, but would not hesitate to kill ATF agent Billy McQueen. He personally tells of the bonds he formed with some of the members. One could tell the pain he experienced in prosecuting his fellow gang-members at the end of the book.This is truly one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read - one I could not put down."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I cant say enough good about this book. Fast paced. A quick read. Great photos to match names with faces. Anyone interested in true crime or outlaw motorcycle gangs should read this book. The author is obviously honest and authentic. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It is one-part historical, with a look at some of the most notorious motorcycle gangs in the world, and the crimes that they commit. It is one-part sociological, with an interesting view of war veterans and the different paths they choose in society, the stereotypes that society places place on all bikers (not just the \\"one-percenters\\"), as well as the fascination some have with these outlaws that often result in tragic consequences. It is also psychological, as some aspects of the undercover operation are truly mind-provoking - how does Bill Queen maintain his sense of right versus wrong when he feels more acceptance from the Mongols than his own department? How does Bill Queen cope knowing that any chance in demeanor from any one of his fellows Mongols might bring his unsuspecting demise? It's a book that you can't put down, and it will raise the hair on the back of your neck more than once.Bill Queen, his children, friends and family all made sacrifices, so that other children like Rocky Jr. and Easy's sisters' children can grow up safe and enjoy future birthdays, without the senseless violence, drugs, and poverty around them."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Like a lot of red blooded guys I had fantasized (well, daydreamed anyway) about riding with an Outlaw Motorcycle Gang.C'mon, who out there hasn't?After this book I am glad to put that fantasy away for good. And you will be too...but boy, what a voyeuristic ride you are in for.The author puts you right there where you will smell the blood. Right there where you will feel the blows to your face and jaw. And right there while you quiver with fear as you are instructed to stab a poor fellow who just happened to walk in the wrong door - that of a biker bar.You will also be suprised by the emotion the author conveys toward these people he stalks, yet finds himself feeling parental towards. Thru the author you find yourself rooting for the bad guys to somehow see the light.But most of all the book will let you lay that outlaw fantasy to rest. So next time you pass a biker bar in Tujunga or East Los Angeles, just keep going...I will see you down the road at the Dairy Queen."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I am female sixty five, Not sure I would like this. I had heard the author of No Angel talk on a radio show, and was going to buy that one. Then I saw Under and Alone and decided to buy that because it was less money. I wanted to see if I was really interested. Well what a pleasant surprise. I could not put the book down. It is really great and so interesting. The writer just keeps the story flowing and you want to keep reading. I was really sorry when it ended. I highly recommend this book regardless of gender or age. I would read this one before you read No Angel by Jay Dobyns."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"As the ex-wife of one of the main characters in the book, I can tell the readers that William Queen told the whole truth and nothing but the truth...it was 100% accurate and in no way exaggerated. Only on a few minor occasions did his recollection of events differ slightly from mine, but only the smallest and most unimportant of details. This book was amazing and well written - good job Billy! I cannot describe the feelings that ran through me as I read this book, as I read page after page of events that I remember like yesterday. I was also taken back to the phone call I got from Billy on May 19th, 2000, telling me who he was and what was happening. How I didn't belong with those people. Even though I had to re-live all the feelings of hurt and betrayal I felt the day my life changed forever, I am thankful now to be out of that life and where I am today. Not only was this man a hero in the eyes of many, but he changed my life. Billy, in the event you ever read this review, I just wanted you to know that."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Motorcycle clubs have been romanticized in this country for over fifty years and while 99% of them (and my brother-in-law is a member of a club) are decent, hard-working everyday guys and girls, it's that 1% that has always piqued the interest of the general public and the reason there were so many movies dealing with gangs like the Hell's Angels in the 1960's and 1970's. The public has an infatuation with them much like with the Mafia.Bill Queen is nuts...has to be to do what he did and live amongst these people for over two years, doing drugs and commiting crimes just to prove his worth to the gang. And he didn't just risk his life then, but even now he is a target for those he helped bring to justice. It is most interesting how Queen notes that these men are so much like the Mafia in that there is true love and friendship among the members, and yet they wouldn't hesitate to kill their own if they stepped out of line. It's a kind of almost hive relationship that most people just cannot fathom.Wow, what an incredibly riveting tale. Bill Queen certainly gives new meaning to the word guts."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"A \\"great\\" book written by a true American hero. Queen exposes these bikers for what they are, criminals, family men, brothers, motorcycle enthusiasts and, most of all, too human. While some are absolutely evil, most seem to be guys who have been lured by the outlaw lifestyle and all its rewards without willing to accept its punishments as well. Remember, the motorcycle gang came into being primarily with true American heroes of WWII, looking for adventure after losing the pumped up lifestyle of war. William Queen goes under cover and remarkably infiltrates the Mongrol MC. Ultimately he becomes \\"patched in\\", a full fledged member of this criminal enterprise. The stories he tells are heartbreaking at times, brutal at others, but all the while Queen never lost sight of his goal of exposing them for what they do. He experiences what has become the all to often dilemma for these type of law enforcement agents. These are indeed his brothers and he is knowingly working to put them in prison for the rest of thier lives. Queen taps into his own sense of betrayal, outrage, sadness, and fear, as the investigation continues. Quite a remarkable investigation and a remarkable book."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Bill Queen, whom I knew personally, has captured the essence of working undercover against outlaw biker groups. I also did numerous criminal cases against them, albiet much less deep undercover, long before Bill's brilliant effort. ATF management was even harder to work with back then. Many managers came from the old 'still bustin'\\" days of Eliott Ness with that same mentality. Bill's successful prosecutions are a tribute to the tenacity of he and the case agent, John Ciccone, who both overcame not only the obstacles of the criminal case, but overcame the obstructive \\"numbers\\" driven management.This book is a \\"must read\\" for law enforcement, their families, and anyone interested in going into the field. It's insight, honesty, and accuracy make it unique in a field often cluttered with \\"wannabes\\". Great job, Bill.Erik R."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"If there's a lesson that can be drawn from Queen's lengthy travels through the rough part of town, it's that life as a Federal Agent isn't what it's cracked up to be. As a people, we're bred on a steady diet of flashy police dramas (CSI, NYPD Blue, Law and Order, etc.). They do little to prepare the average cadet for what they're going to confront in the criminal tar pit that Billy Queen wades into.Undercover work, in general, is a fine way to ruin your marriage, wreck your nerves, and lose your sense of identity. Be prepared to sacrifice the life that you once had, and sadly witness the fallout that results. It's almost as if Queen suffers more than the people that he help put away. This is the fine print that the recruiters don't want you to read.Speaking from direct experience, undercover work is essentially an act of betrayal. You live with these people, eat with them, party with them, and then testify against them in court. An agent might take years to be accepted into the fold, and then have to dump it all over the side of the ship in the blink of an eye. It's bad enough that you lose contact with your old friends, now you've got to give up all of your new ones. Guess what? Now you don't have any friends.As Queen observes, it wasn't easy. There were actually times when he considered giving up his role as an ATF agent and crossing the line to the other side. I can't say that I blame him. His Mongol brethen often treated him with more respect, and genuine love, than his ATF handlers (who, more likely than not, saw Billy as an expendable \\"resource\\").You're on your own, surrounded by a group of individuals who, by the standards of modern society, aren't much more than animals. It takes a very strong individual to survive the rigors of this sort of undercover work.Billy, man, I don't know where you are, but I have a feeling that you might read this review some day. Many thanks for pouring out your memories, and heart, onto the printed page. People like me will try very hard to pass on your words to the younger folks, so that they might understand, and appreciate, the plight of the under-paid government employee known as the ATF agent."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Thank God for William Queen!!! I just finished his book -Under and Alone - and am amazed at what this man went through to get the bad guys. What a great human being! I loved that part at the end of the book where he writes about knowing that these were serious bad guys that needed to be put away - but there was another factor - after living with them for 2 1/2 years he had witnessed it, lived it, felt it, and understood the love that these guys felt for their brothers, him included. That gave me goosebumps. There was a thin line there for him. Not everything is black or white. Sometimes there is that gray area. I hope that he remains safe and can have happiness in his life. He certainly deserves it!!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book is easily a 5 star review save for a few minor things. It is a shame Amazon does not have 1/2 stars you can add. This is a really interesting book above an undercover agent that infiltrates and actually gets patched into the Mongols(an outlaw motorcycle gang). What makes this unique is how far into the gang he actually got, and that it involves a gang other than the Hell's Angels who have had more than there share of books written about them. This is a quick and easy read, which is good in one way, but it left me wanting for more. I think this could have been fleshed out a little more. I would have liked to hear more about how his deep undercover mission affected his kids and family. Aside from a few paragraphs, the author breezes over the subject. It is a minor quibble, but the story was so interesting, I would have loved to have more."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"The author, a retired ATF agent, goes undercover with a southern California chapter of the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang that comes off as even more violent and dangerous than the better-known Hells Angels. Queen draws compelling portraits of the psychopaths who populate this world, men who would have supposedly killed him in an instant if they ever discovered his true identity. Still, these guys couldn't have been all that treacherous because Queen managed to maintain his double-life for more than two years, living nearby and always trailed by his boss lurking somewhere in a shadowy unmarked car. How hard would it have been for a Mongol to follow him to his real home some night? Where this tale really fails is after Queen decides to end his charade and start making busts. We never get the perspective of any of the Mongols whose criminal portraits come to life before their arrests. What did they think after they learned they were riding with a cop all that time? This most dramatic aspect of the story is given short shrift in the final few pages, and we never really learn too much, either, about how his undercover act destroyed Queen's marriage and hurt his relationship with his young kids. Readers will be left with questions, but this is still an entertaining book."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I can only imagine what kind of situations Mr. Queen went through that were not in the book. Both touching and sad, these guys really cared for their brothers and I can see where Mr. Queen had a difficult time with the operation. It is too bad everyday people can't create bonds like these guys had. I ended up wishing they didn't go down the way they did. I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"As gripping as any well written crime novel this real life account of an undercover ATF agent's infiltration into a terrifying motorcycle gang is the type of book you just can't put down.The book offers unique, almost anthropological, insights into a modern day motorcycle gang while at the same time exploring the toll the assignment took on the author himself.I recommend this book to all fans of true crime as well as those who enjoy and intense white knuckle ride.Destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I have read several \\"Biker\\" books and this one has to be the best so far.For all the content that could have been included, this book was too short. I wish there was an Under and Alone II or III.Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It is immediately clear upon reading this book that Queen is a straightforward, honest and intellectually pragmatic man who has incorporated military thinking into his thought process. Under And Alone reads like an After Action Report, filled with meticulous detail which is to the point, simply written and is home to some unnecessary profanity ejaculations. Queens casual writing style is enjoyable but also entirely forgettable, writing as he would probably speak in person. The author doesn't strike me as a particularly talented or intelligent writer - but the content of Under And Alone more than make up for these nearly irrelevant shortcomings.I read Under And Alone in one sitting - it was surely a page turner! You will be brought along on the dark epic journey of Queens transformation from clean cut ATF agent to bearded Mongol gangster. During the authors odyssey he begins to question his loyalties to the bureaucratic, cold and indifferent ATF administration and when his adopted mother dies finds no solace in the latters company, instead siding with his biker brothers who unanimously support him. At several points in the book we readers begin to wonder if Billy St. John, the authors biker alias, has replaced William Queen. While Queen never admits to committing any capital offenses and manages to hang onto his baseline of morality he increasingly becomes estranged from his supposed law enforcement brethren and hints at the possibility of simply fleeing with the Mongols.Essentially this crisis of identity is what the story is about moreso than supposed heroics and the criminal investigation itself: as the book drags on more and more words are dedicated to commenting on the authors sense of inner turmoil and indecision. The final chapters of the book read like a sort of apology to the Mongols and it is clear that Queen performed his job of testifying against them with no joy or sense of pride but rather sadness and confusion. Ultimately Queen does hold onto his identity, declaring in the final lines of the book:\\"Would you state your full name for the court, and spell the last name, please?\\"It took me a moment to regain my composure. \\"Yes, Your Honor. It's William Queen. Q-U-E-E-N. Special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\\""},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"A interesting read, but makes you wonder how much was actual fact and how much was embellished.

Anyone would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It's been a long time since I read a book in one day. Couldn't put this one down. Bill Queen's compelling tale of life undercover with an outlaw motorcycle gang keeps you on the edge-of-your seat from cover to cover. The author does an excellent job detailing the conflicting job of a long-term undercover agent, from the relationships he reluctantly formed, grew to value, then ultimately betrayed. The Mongols come across as a intermittently violent, often haphazard band of outlaw brothers -- not into crime for personal gain or a lavish lifestyle, these guys seemed largely dirt-poor (they could barely keep their bikes from falling apart) and only seemed to engage in enough crime to support their lifestyle.To the one critical reviewer who complained that the book didn't provide enough follow-through with the gang members after the undercover operation was disclosed, please remember that the book is non-fictiion. It's not a (yet) a movie and is told from the author's POV. It's unlikely that Bill Queen was privy to the reaction of the Mongols after the jig was up. Other than seeing them in court (for those who didn't take a plea), I doubt he saw any of them again."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Awesome book. It was hard to put the book down. William Queen made many personal sacrifices and physically put himself at risk to allow arrests to be made to safe guard each of us. We take for granted the risks and work of our law enforcement staff."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Read this book in one sitting which for me is very hard to do! I am not a big fan of motocycles or their gangs, but once I picked this book up, I couldnt put it down! Read this plus Jay Dobyns - \\"No Angel\\" about the hells angels."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Written from a man who, fighting in Special Forces and doing gritty police work, must always live on the edge, William Queen, divorced with children and a girlfriend, sacrifices his salvaged life to go undercover. He infiltrates the country's most violent motorcycle gang, The Mongols, and earns his stripes by faking drugs and acting as tough as the barbarians who are scrutinizing his every move. One of the most harrowing elements of the book is the author's ability to profile the motorcycle gangster mentality. These are men who devote their whole life to purging whatever goodness they have in them out of their system and to becoming as evil, sociopathic, and violent as possible. Why? Because, the author points out, they worship one thing only--power and the way to achieve that power is to instill fear in others. The sampling of grotesqueries the author describes is frightening enough, but all the more terrifying since any second we fear that William Queen will be found out and killed. One thing that makes the book so suspensful is that throughout the book Queen maintains a dreadful tension between the gangs' love for him and their suspcicion of him. You never know if and when the facade is going to crack. I'll let you read the book to find out how it ends. One thing for sure, this book will be made into a film. I'm sure the movie rights have already been sold. And what a great movie it will be."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"...but Queen doesn't let us in all the way. Just as his being under and alone among the Mongols alienates him from his children and his friends, it alienates the reader to large degree as well. He spends a lot of time telling us that he's feeling alone and conflicted, rather than really describing the incidents and stories that make him feel that way.For every tantalizing, slice-of-life detail and description from his time with the Mongols that are included, there is far more rote description and purely mechanical narration. I strongly suspect that if Queen had collaborated with a more experienced writer, the stronger points of his very engaging story would be allowed to surface.As it is, the excellent material struggles a little in the care of a man who has spent so many years writing field reports. If you're interested in the story of an undercover agent infiltrating a motorcycle gang, it's a good, quick read, but don't expect much more than a workman-like skill in presentation."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"William Queen aka Billy St. John is a agent for the Bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms and the veteran of a few successful deep undercover operations so when he is approached by his boss who has a confidential informant that is willing to help get a agent inside of is described as the most violent motorcycle gang in america. when the author and agent is approached with the opportunity he jumps at the chance and is introduced to the bar that chapter of the San Fernando Mongols hangs out in the story really takes off. Of course it goes without saying that it helps that william queen has quite a passion for motorcycles one that he has had for most of his life.William Queen takes on the undercover name of Billy St. John and starts out as just a hang around and over the period of 28 months he works his way all the way upto full patch member which is pretty amazing considering the lengths that the motorcycle gangs go through to check on the backgrounds of prospects in his case for the Mongols he had to fill out a 4 page application. He was able to make it to different officer positions with in the San Fernando chapter and along the way gather info on all the different criminal activitys which ran quite wide from witness tampering to murder.But all through the book once he became prospect upto full patch member he had to deal with the pressures on family and surprising the feelings with knowing that he was going to have guys arrested who surprisingly had strong bonds in their brotherhood and and actual true love for their fellow brothers the one instance that really stands out when he had family member pass away and he left the Atf and Mongols for a short time when he came back his fellow agents hardly expressed any sympathy or to let him know that they were there for him they Mongols whereIf you really want to see what the motorcycle gang life is like this will diffently give you a real feeling for it this a book i wouls recommend 5 Stars for sure"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"An excellent read. A true inside look into the inner workings of the Mongols MC. This book truely captures the 1%er lifestyle, their traditions, their feelings about society, and each other. I look forward to the screenplay. Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Good read but I couldnt help but feel like the author left a lot of stuff out. It just seemed like everytime a dangerous situation came up, there was this very simple way out. too simply and hard to believe. Im expected to believe the atf agent never did any drugs during his 2 1/2 yrs. undercover. I recommend Hells angels into the abyss by Yves Lavigne. Its more realistic and way more interesting. I think the fact that the majority of the book has to do with a informant gave the book a deeper look into what most motorcycle gangs are like."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Mr Queen's book is the best I've read on this subject. It was a real page turner that was impossible to put down after I started it. Not only is William Queen a dedicated law enforcement officer and biker, he is also an excellent writer. I enjoyed every page.I am a member of a law enforcement motorcycle club myself and I recognized many of the conflicts Mr Queen experienced as he went through the process of becoming a patched member of an outlaw motorcycle club. He did this and was able to maintain his personal identity as a member of the ATF. All the while evading discovery by the club itself.Great book and a great service rendered by Mr Queen. William Queen has real guts."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I bought this book because receintly I met a Mongol member. I had no idea what that meant, so, I bought this book. The book really gave me the inside story of everyday life inside of this outlaw motorcycle gang.It is like watching a train wreck you know it is horribly wrong, but you can't look away. Or in this case stop reading."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Great book and a fast easy read. I was sad when I finished it because I wanted to read more."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"It isn't well written, but the story is tough. William Queen/Billy St. James really put his life and his family's life in peril to bring down some real-deal criminals. This will make a great movie some day."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is the first book in years that kept me up at night reading, it's like your caught up in the undercover rush from start to finnish."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Easy reading...didn't want to put it down. Honest and heartfelt, yet equally brutal and disturbing. A courageous account of an intense undercover case."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"Wow William Queen...I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. An amazing man who is brutally honest. A must read!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is an absolute MUST READ and I could hardly put it down!! I've been on the Admin side of law enforcement over 25 years and my son is a cop, so for my sanity I normally stay away from books like this. But a friend of mine heard Billy give a speech at a gang seminar several years ago and she happened to mention something he said and it caught my attention. I decided to look him up and I'm so glad I did!! Billy makes you feel like you're right there with him as he tells you all about his experience with the Mongols and his ability to 'adapt' to their lifestyle. After reading this book it put uc work in a whole new perspective for me. I realized that their life as they once knew it no longer existed. They're forced to live a double-life and in some cases, they leave their old lives behind until the assignment is complete. Their lives and their families lives are constantly in danger. The UC's family ends up suffering because of their absence. It saddens me for what Billy & his family went through to put these criminals behind bars. I just hope his sons read this book and realize the sacrifices that he made and how much pain and suffering he was going through by not being able to see them as often as he wanted to.GREAT JOB, Billy!!! Can't wait to start your next book."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I attended a seminar by Billy Queen then decided to get the book. A great read. Thank you Agent Queen for what you did."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I don't normally read books in this genre, but it popped up in my \\"recommended items\\" (not sure why?) and I thought, why not? I don't regret my decision.I am impressed by Queen's honesty. Though sometimes his voice was slightly macho, particularly when he described \\"action\\" scenes (and I note, along with other reviewers, that the action was often ambiguous and suggestive, a trifle \\"watered-down\\" yet vaguely over-the-top dramatic), he wrote truthfully about the parts that mattered: his struggles with his betrayal of his \\"brothers\\", keeping perspective when things were tough that this was, at the end of the night, a job and he was playing a persona and finally, the bittersweet relief he felt at the end of the operation.It would have been easy for Queen to write an inflammatory and negative book about OMGs, particularly after his many tension-filled encounters with Red Dog. He could have easily hidden behind bravado and written a book about being a hero and catching \\"bad guys\\". Instead, I walked away from this book with the feeling that he recognized and connected with the humanity in the men and women that he met and befriended -- at least, most of them. The fact that he had to keep reminding himself that these people were \\"outlaws\\" testifies to their humanity as well as the difficulty of his job. I like that I got the sense that these people were real people and, violence and bad choices aside, in a way I, too, am envious of the strength of their bonds. Like Queen, when a close relative of mine passed away, my co-workers said nothing and even my closest friends simply said \\"I'm sorry\\". There were no bear hugs, no \\"I love you, sister\\".I only have a few, semi-criticisms. First, I wish we'd gotten a few more details: how exactly did Queen manage to lead a double-life for two years? How did he manage to sneak off and see his children at all? Did he have any slip-ups and accidentally mention his kids? Secondly, Queen's writing is, at times, a bit clumsy and vague in a way that was frustrating to read. I realize this book was not intended to read like artful and profound prose, but I think the editor could have helped polish it a bit more. Finally, I'd like to hear more about how he dealt with the aftermath of this operation. Feeling guilt and betrayal seems like a natural consequence, even though this was all in the parameters of a job and yes, many of these men were behaving in ways that were unlawful. I guess I wanted to know a bit more about how he did it, and how did he deal with these feelings afterwards. Again, these aren't necessarily criticisms, per se, just things I would have liked to have read more of, or seen handled just a little bit differently.I highly recommend this book for a compelling, insightful and absorbing read!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I really enjoyed this book and Mr. Queen's recollection of Events. At times, it's hard to believe that all of this actually happened! It's unbelievable. This is a book about a true hard working law enforcement officer."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This book keeps you on the edge the entire time. It is a great glimpse into the world of motorcycle gangs. Great read!!"},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"This is a very well-written true story about deep cover infiltration into one of the most notorious Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs in the world.I bought it as a download, and read it from \\"cover to cover\\" in one day. It is hard to imagine the fear and courage present at virtually every moment for many years until the op was done.I highly recommend this book, Under and Alone, for a riveting and totally absorbing read. You will be surprized as to what your thinking is, regarding cops and bad guys, as it morphs through the book."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"The Mongols MC is most famous for their brawl with the Hells Angels MC in Laughlin, NV during the River Run in 2002 as well as for their notoriously disliked former international president Rueben Covazos. I picked this book up after seeing this ATF agent interviewed in a documentary regarding his undercover operation against the club. I figured it would be another Jay Dobyns style exaggeration of a failed operation at prosecuting a motorcycle club. I couldn't have been more wrong. McQueen not only convinced the Mongols MC he was a legitimate biker, he became a full patch Mongol and was eventually promoted to an officer's position within the San Fernando Valley chapter. Over the course of his investigation he was able to gather enough evidence to send several Mongol's to prison through his testimony or simply their guilty plea's.The only strange thing is that at some point McQueen became so emmersed in his role as a Mongol he seems to actually have found some sympathy for the people he was trying to catch and prosecute as well as gained a bit of animosity for the Mongols MC's main rivals the Hells Angel MC. He describes how another undercover agent that was working undercover to infiltrate the Hells Angels was an \\"Angels aficionado\\" which makes you wonder how focused an agent can be with a strange admiration for the target of his undercover work. However, McQueen does end up testifying against the Mongols in open court and sending them away to prison, unlike his Arizona counter part Jay Dobyns who failed miserably."},{"Title":"Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang","review":"I really liked this book. Mr. Queen does a great job of telling the story of how he came to become a member of the Mongols in an non-egotistical fashion.He keeps the readers interest by telling about his day to day dealings with some dangerous individuals and actually earning his patch in the club without always trying to place the spotlight on himself. It's too bad that Jay Dobyns did not read this book before he wrote his. This is a book that anyone who has an interest of learning about the Mongols will have a hard time putting down.Highly recommended reading."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],C={key:0},B={key:1};function x(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",C,"See more"))],8,E)):b("",!0)])}const P=d(H,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-a8e9098e"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/19.md","filePath":"people/19.md"}'),O={name:"people/19.md"},R=Object.assign(O,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(P)]))}});export{F as __pageData,R as default};
