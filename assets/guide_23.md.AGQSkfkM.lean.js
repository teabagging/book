Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy was never one to refrain from controversey in his writing, as is evidenced by his decision after the negative reviews that \\"Jude the Obscure\\" received to never write novels again but to devote himself entirely to poetry. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" opens with perhaps one of the most unique plot devices in Edwardian/Victorian literature, when Michael Henchard, a young haytrusser becomes drunk at a country fair and sells his wife and daughter to whoever will pay five guineas for them. What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Mayor Henchard was drunk when he sold his wife and child. This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph. He will never be heard from again. (The will is on the last few pages of the book.) Fading into nothing, it challenges the reader to find a term for death.

He talks of man's selfishness and desires. He presents his theory, which states that man's destiny is no more than the product of his character and fate. In the wake of the industrial and intellectual revolutions, he gives us an idea of what man's guidelines would become. It such a wondeful novel, that is full of insight and wisdom.

The story revolves around Michael Henchard who, under the influence of alcohol, sold his wife and child. This is enough to demonstrate that one mistake can lead to a life of utter misery. Although Henchard thrives and becomes mayor, his past comes to haunt him when his wife returns. Hardy's description of Henchard's downfall is unrealistic. However, what I found most unconvincing was the manner in which Donald Farfrae completely replaced him. The ending is moving, especially his will, and the book is beautifully written; but I shall always find the parts I found unrealistic the most memorable."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"When one finishes \\"Casterbridge,\\" one is immediately struck by its place in the development of the novel. Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Mayor of Casterbridge is a tale about a man named Michael Henchard and the mistakes he makes in life. It is really well written, Hardy has a skill for great storytelling.

Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting.

There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Rather than repeat tired platitudes about this established literary classic, I'll simply describe my reaction to 'The Mayor of Casterbridge'. It made me nervous and stressed, dreading the next awful event that would follow the painful scene I had just finished, and sure enough, another calamity would promptly occur. Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life. I thought I had read this book in high school fifty years ago, but if I really did, it affected me less then than it did now. Finishing the last page with a sense of relief, I gratefully turned to Anthony Trollope for my next read."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"\\"For my part I don't see why men who have got wives, and don't want 'em, shouldn't get rid of 'em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses.\\" ---The Mayor of CasterbridgeAnd with those words (and the act they inspire), Michael Henchard brings a lifetime of misery down on himself. The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era. Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different.

That aspect of the story is timeless."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"this is the first book ive read out of thomas hardy's many works, and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. he uses his perceptive insight into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalites.each scene he describes is filled with vivid imagery that leave your senses tingling.i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a well-written, easy-to-understand classic."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets.

It came just in time."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected.

In relationships, he is cold when his nearest and dearest wish to be close to him, and then seeks them out after it is too late."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas. The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival. Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This 1964 Heritage Club Edition is a treasure! The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line. However, there are hopes that your interest has been peeked and that you will give this book a complete reading. Also, there are DVD's of this story which can be accessed on Amazon. This writer watched a DVD initially and then read the book.

Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing.

In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I loved the book!

Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'?

Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature.

The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This was an ok novel. It has many plots and twists and is a little hard to follow. The cliff notes make the book much easier to follow."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This book was astounding. Never have i read such a wonderful piece of literature. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The notes on the back of my copy of this book describe it as a &quot;Sophoclean&quot; tragedy. This is a very apt description. Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I loved the irony. I mean, how much worse could life get for the Mayor? After selling his wife, and swearing off drinking, what was left for him? When he meets his wife again, it becomes to turning point of his life once again, including his &quot;daughter&quot;."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I was nearly put off reading this by friends who termed it \\"depressing\\". This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair. Subconsciously feeling his wife, Susan, is holding him back from success in this world, he awakes to sobriety the next morning and realizes that, in a foolish fit of pique, he has auctioned her and his daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, off to a sailor. Despite his frantic efforts to find them, they have disappeared. Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure. If there is one thing I can say to you, it's this: read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It would be a great injustice to one of the most profound stories of our time."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel. Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Opinions on this novel seem to be a bit polarized to say the least. The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read. Additionally, it represents the transition between the more emotional, passion-centered Romantic era (Henchard) to the more mechanical Victorian Era (Farfrae), and that in itself is a pretty interesting concept."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The story twists and turns and Hardy takes the reader on a journey exploring the hopes and shattered dreams of the book's central characters.This is a masterpiece.I, like many reviewers above, had to study this text aged 16 for school exams. At the time, I remeber thinking that the long winded descriptions of the countryside irritated me. Perhaps now, aged 28, I would appreciate this book more. I feel that those who criticise it are entitled to do so - but the criticisms (if genuine) ought to be more constructive than those above - which are just bitter and inmature!As a story, this is first class and a must. Read it and savour it."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"If I were ever to be an English Literature teacher, The Mayor of Casterbridge is the first book I'd start with. Not just because it's filled with themes of major gravity or features extraordinary descriptions of England and its culture, but simply because it's a damn good read. One reads it at a breakneck pace, occasionally stopping only when plot twists have one's jaw dropping on the floor. This is one of the most truly amazing books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance. Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret. He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read! The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice!"},{"Title":"Mayor of Casterbridge, the","review":"Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall.

However, that book did not have enough practical ideas or skills to guide me decode our old agreements/emotional garbage, how to be aware and how to transform. This book has a practical guide to teach us how to live in the four agreements. It teaches us how to become aware and how to transform.1. Bring the Awareness to Surface so We Can Let Go of the Parasites, the Old Agreement, the Judge, the Victim, the fear2. How to transform by the second attention (become aware and not act on or judge too fast), action-reaction, attach-detachDon Miguel Ruiz has a very playful style of writing when he was telling us the above skills. I think in essence, the above skills suggests us to slow down our thinking process to give us enough time to steer our feelings and actions to apply the four agreements and to enjoy life intensely within the moment. His dialogue about the four agreements and other people&iexcl;s stories about applying the four agreements give me hope that I can live my life with what he has suggested. The dialogue helps us to decode certain emotional garbage and the dialogue helps me to break the old agreements. It is definitely a must-read if you have read the four agreements.

But I'm not waiting around for everybody :-)This book carries through on the original book's promise to liberate the human being by realizing how we can MAKE our own reality instead of just accepting (and suffering through) the one that is given to us by the dream of the world. I'm just beginning to use the workbook and I can tell that it is just what I need to put Don Muguel Ruiz's ideas into practice. The original book plus The Mastery of Love ought to be read first.I will let you know how I fare in this quest for mastering the dream of MY life.

You can see that from my grades of other his books. But this book is dissapointment for me.I read some other experiental and companion books that were much better, for example Teachings of don Carlos or Celestine Prophecy - an experiental guide.In all these books the diary writing as a method is included too, but in the Four Agreements Companion Book the writing in the diary or notebook is the only method. In very short time it becomes boring.Maybe if it was not a book of Miguel Ruiz I would grade it with greater mark, but because Ruiz is so briliant writer, I'll give 3 to this book.My opinion is that last part of Four Agreements, last part of Mastery of Love and the book Beyond the Fear are much better experiental guides for Miguels teachings."},{"Title":"The Four Agreements Companion Book : Using the Four Agreements to Master the Dream of Your Life","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone.

Like &quot;The Four Agreements&quot;, much of the content in this book is based on Eastern philosophies and attaining personal freedom and happiness. This book expands upon &quot;The Four Agreements&quot; by indicating one's life is a dream, a dream that is often dictated by others. In this light, &quot;domestication&quot; is seen as the root of human suffering.There is much to be learned from the Toltec way, and I highly recommend both this book and &quot;Awakening the Buddha Within&quot; by Lama Surya Das.

I imagine a lot of people would have liked some basic guidance on where to go with this great code of conduct.So, in comes the /Companion Book/. Sure enough, it does include a lot of exercises and advice. Kudos to don Miguel and Janet Mills for covering the practical side. But the book is remarkably redundant and even manages to sometimes contradict or cast a little doubt on itself and /The Four Agreements/. If you've read the original book, 70% of the material here is a severely disorganized rehashing of the ideas you already learned. Honestly, it feels like the Companion Book was the first draft of /The Four Agreements/.However! The book *does* include a lot of exercises for self-inquiry that can illuminate things in ways you may not expect. Those exercises are valuable, and I think they can help you find a place for the Four Agreements in your life.My basic opinion on the book can be split into two parts:** If you've read /The Four Agreements/: skip the blathering parts and go straight to the exercises in each chapter. They're worth serious contemplation and exploration -- and you'll have plenty of time for said exploration, if you don't waste your time re-reading all the stuff you already learned in the first book.** If you haven't read /The Four Agreements/: you could just buy this book by itself and you'd basically get a refresher course on what the other one covers... However, I would actually recommend against that. /The Four Agreements/ is the superior book, and it covers everything much more coherently and concisely than the rehashing treatment you get in the /Companion/.This book could have been about 50 pages instead of 200+ if it didn't include so much doubling back on what the original /Four Agreements/ already talked about. The practical exercises are worthwhile, the interview with don Miguel is fun to read, and the \\"true stories\\" of people's experiences with the Agreements can be encouraging (though they are a bit two-dimensional). I just wish the bulk of the book was not an inferior imitation of /The Four Agreements/ itself."},{"Title":"The Four Agreements Companion Book : Using the Four Agreements to Master the Dream of Your Life","review":"With only four stars on the average review for this I had to add a review of my own!

Honestly, the Four Agreements are wonderful points to live by, and I do every day. However, it seems quite bizarre to me that one would need this book (or any other) to explain what these four simple sentences mean:1) Speak your thoughts clearly2) Don't ASSume3) Don't take things personally4) Do your bestFolks, these are NOT hard things to understand, and you definitely don't need books to figure this stuff out (well, ok, maybe some of you do :-).

Peace."},{"Title":"The Four Agreements Companion Book : Using the Four Agreements to Master the Dream of Your Life","review":"I've never seen new age spirituality as exploitative as Ruiz's. The \\"First Agreement is \\"be impeccable with your word\\". Do you think the Toltecs even had a word for impeccable? They had glyphs, not syllabaries or alphabets. The Toltec empire died out roughly 800 years ago, and the Aztecs and Mayans kept the memory of them alive until the Spanish came. Ruiz would have been much more believable if he claimed to know the secrets of Aztec philosophy. People long for exotic, esoteric spirituality when it seems like traditional religions aren't enough. So, Ruiz comes along to exploit the spiritual and moral insecurities of modern society. He believes he has this \\"nagual\\" \\"eagle knight\\" heritage to enlighten peoples' minds. Did he have this title confirmed on him through through a Toltec or Meso-American chieftan? No, he just decided he was more enlightened than everyone else because of a car crash with a near death experience. You have to get a kick out of neo-shamans who give themselves self serving spiritual titles to manipulate people and make money. Stay away from this huckster. Better yet, skip over to Carlos Castaneda. At least his work isn't filled with platitudes and self-help garbage. Ruiz is just a big conman. If he were such a great guy, maybe he'd stick up for the rights of Central American people and try to bring them out of poverty. In other words, he should pay back some of the ancestors of the Toltecs for his blatant exploitation. Instead, he travels the world first class, has a yacht, probably owns a few mansions and homes, maybe a cocaine habit, some prostitutes, who knows. Maybe he puts Jimmy Baker to shame. He even looks far more Spanish than he does Native American like he claims to be. To top it off, he has a, \\"belief in the legend of Atlantis; his belief that the sun entered its sixth age on January 11, 1992, which should lead to a new age for humanity\\". Gee, I remember 1992. Everyone started acting more peaceful. Yeah right. Don't fall for this guys snake oil. You're better off going to church. \\"Self-Help Book\\" is an oxymoron term itself. How are you helping yourself if you're reading someone else's writing? Anyway, stay away from this quack. Learn to think critically. Study various forms of philosophy/social science/humanities/religion or some other subject where the truth is in your interpretation. Not in some hucksters. In other words, stay away from this guys' works and other New Age bullcrap. Learn to think critically.

I just loved reading as she transformed from a petulant, selfish brat to a person who put the good of her family and community before her own needs. &quot;The Beaded Moccassins&quot; does not simplify this transformation by making judgements about Europeans or Indians, instead it shows this transformation as something that occurs out of sense of maturity and a desire to belong. A coming of age story as well as the story of an Indian captive.As I said before I wish it had been longer. It only covers the first year or so of what turned into a six year long captivity. It would have been great to see the person Mary became among the Indians at age 18, and how she and both her families, white and red, reacted to her return to the whites.I grew up near the area where most of this book takes place.(I am a native of Cleveland, Ohio.)

Well you would find these details in the book The Beaded Moccasins.This historical fiction was about a girl named Mary Campbell. She was just turning 12. She loved her family but they would bug her sometimes. Mary came from Fairfield, Connecticut and was made to move west to Ohio. Her dad called it westering. I think she was brave and courageous. Mary always wanted to be outside and never work hard. She was kind of selfish until she was captured. For example when she was made to work in the garden and last in that cold winter with just a dress and leggings. She really started to feel that she did something that she could never fix and she should have not ran out into the field and disrespect her mother and that where she lived before was much better than where she is now.There were many good details and interesting settings. For example the Campbell's farm was set on fire by the Delaware Indians just to capture Mary. Also Mary felt very lonely and afraid of life. She needed to be more courageous. The Delaware made the boys jump into the ice covered river to make them stronger so she tried it and her Grand father whipped her so hard. I didn't like one part of the book because the Delaware killed Mrs. Stewart's baby because it would not stop crying.

Sometimes, she would struggle with herself about her Delaware &quot;family&quot; and whether she loved or hated them. She changed her mind so often that it was hard to know what I was supposed to think. I also thought that Mrs. Stewart's character was hard to follow. When her son Sammy was first killed, she had no desire to stay with the tribe, but she stayed with then even so. She also went mad in the middle of the story, when she thought that a log was Sammy. Strangely enough, she soon recovered when traded to Sequin, a Frenchman, even though she did not love him.

My granddaughter is five and very interested in ballet. The book has inspired her."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"When my youngest was about five I desperately tried to find this book-this was in the pre-amazon, pre-ebay days. Somehow I found the authors' phone number and called her...she was super nice, but informed me that all of these books had been discontinued. Very sad, as they make wonderful gifts, and I was so hoping to give it to my youngest for her birthday.I am hoping that the publisher re-issues these wonderful books...please??? I now have some new nieces who are the perfect age for them....but it is hard to find them in pristine quality."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"Okay, this is seriously the best book EVER!!! This was the first A Very Young... book Jill Krementz wrote and photographed, and definitely the best. The girl the book is about, Stephanie, is a classy 10-year-old girl in the '70's. She attends the American School of Ballet and throughout the book you see her classes and the positions they do, the auditioning for the Nutcracker (she gets the part of Mary), the play itself, and my favorite pictures were of her in her bedroom (the '70's were SO cool!), the picture of her and her sister Andrea (who is my age in the book, and has the cutest clothes) on toe shoes, Andrea doing her makeup, and when she's wearing this cute dress and a scarf tied in her hair (:Also, this book made me really want to take ballet, and now I started and I love it!So, if you weren't sure whether to get it -- you should DEFINITELY buy it!!! And if you bought it already, you're going to love it!"},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"My husband recently bought this book for me as a present, it was gently used but pay you no mind to that! When I received it I instantly was transformed to my 8 year old self and remembered this book as my favorite. I checked it out of the library every chance I could as a young girl wishing to go to NY and become a ballerina. Ms. Krementz finds a way through beautiful photography and words to bring those of us who probably never would have had the chance to have a starring role in the Nutcracker, to experience a bit of a dream."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"While Jill Krementz is a talented photographer, what my daughter and I really loved about this series was the very detailed text. She was fascinated to learn that each level at the School of American Ballet wears a different color leotard. She sympathized with the dancer who wants a new role in The Nutcracker, but gets the same casting. She learned the difference between a class, a rehearsal, and a performance - all opportunities to dance, but each with a specific purpose.The original Jill Krementz books, like this one, were printed in black and white. A few later books (\\"A Very Young Skier\\") are in full color. But while the color photos look more contemporary and appealing, the later books are \\"dumbed down\\" - the text is very short, more like picture captions than narrative.For the wonderful sense of detail you need the classic titles like \\"A Very Young Dancer.\\" They make a dancer's life so real, a young reader can easily picture herself (or himself) doing the same. And that's the real power of this series: instead of being a passive spectator, the young reader becomes a participant. My daughter is now dancing in The Nutcracker for her ninth (and last) year. I think \\"A Very Young Dancer\\" was a big help along the way."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"I am a ballet dancer. I have been dancing for 15 years now, and this is still one of my favorite books. I was introduced to it when I was about 5 and it facinated me. The whole story seemed true to what I knew about ballet and Stephanie, the main character, lived my biggest dreams! For years, I only borrowed it from the library, and soon it was one of the most worn in their collection! Finally, we moved away and the next library didn't have it, but Mom found it at a used book store and bought it for me. I ended up meeting David Richards, a teacher in the book, at a ballet competition and he signed it for me. He told me that Stephanie doesn't dance any more, and I don't think she ever made it into New York City Ballet company or any other ballet company. Like I said earlier, I've been dancing 15 years and this book, to me, is even more a true embodiment of what the every-day life of a ballet dancer is! I've known this book so long that I can quote it forwards and backwards, and almest every sentence is or has been true for me! I just finished a run of Nutcracker and, \\"I tore a little pink ribbon off the pantaloons that I wore in the party scene to keep for a souvenir.\\"-to quote page 118. I am positive that current dancers, former dancers, future dancers, and sancers in their dreams will absolutly love this book, especially because it is so true to what they feel!"},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"I am very partial to this book because it was one of my favorites when I was a little girl. I do believe this book is an absolute must-have for any young girl who takes part in the performing arts, particularly ballet. A VERY YOUNG DANCER is about a beautiful little girl named Stephanie who is a student at the prestigious American School of Ballet. We see her learning technique with her fellow students under the direction of David Howard. Eventually, we see her live the dream of many little would-ballerinas as Stephanie is chosen for the part of Mary (or Clara in many versions) in the New York City Ballet's production of the Nutcracker. I think the most important aspect of this book is the message--hard work, determination, and a good attitude are essential for making dreams come true."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift around 1980, I believe. I cannot tell you how much this book meant to me as a girl. I must have read it about 200 times. My mother recently moved and was going through all our childhood things and found the book packed away. She gave it to me. I was so delighted because I thought I'd lost the book years ago. I sat down immediately and read it again. And yep...its still as good as it ever was."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. A Very Young Dancer was one of her picks.This is a story of a girl, Stephanie, who has the starring girl's role in The Nutcracker at age 10. The book is full of wonderful photographs that show ballet as it is experienced by the dancers. The story is written as though by Stephanie, so you see the world from her perspective.My daughter loved this story so much, that she would beg me to keep reading. I would keep going until my voice was so hoarse I could not continue. And I loved the story, too.Almost all little girls become interested in ballet at some point. This book is a wonderful way to encourage and expand on that interest while your child is too young to actually begin training. The material in this book can help sustain an interest in ballet later on, either as a dancer or as a fan. It will certainly encourage everyone who reads it to see The Nutcracker performed again this holiday season.Although the story is focused on Stephanie, she also dances with eleven year old Stephen in The Nutcracker. Other male figures include Shaun O'Brien who plays Drosselmeyer and Stephanie's teacher, David Richardson. So boys who are interested in ballet will also find role models here.Overcome your misconceptions that being a child star is bad for children with this heart-warming book about learning, growing up, beauty, and sharing with others."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"When I was a little girl I took this book out of the library every chance I got. If I thought I could have gotten away with it, I would never have given it back. It reminds me of everything I dreamed about when I was about 9 or 10 years old. Fantastic book."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"I first read A Very Young Dancer when I was about seven years old. I only took one term of ballet, but I have always loved it, and made it a tradition to check this beautiful book out from the public library every christmas, right through high school. After reading long memoirs by such NYC Ballet dancers as Edward Villele, I always came back to the photographs in this book...Jill Krementz is wonderful, all of her &quot;Very Young..&quot; books are highly recomended for children, who will probably reread them as adults and remember wanting to be in the circus, or win ice skating championships, like the talented children in this series. A Very Young dancer, however, is the best of the lot. Stephanie, the young narrator and star, feels like a friend...I memorized the photographs of her rehearsals as the lead in The Nutcracker, and scorned small town productions of is as a older child, saying it wasn't the same as the NYCB one...though I had never been to New York.This book is a treasure, for a child of any age with an interest, however passing, in ballet.(Some pretty big ballet characters appear, as well, from Peter Martin to George Balanchine himself.)"},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"Jill Krementz has triumphed once again in her &quot;Very Young&quot; books, this one about a young ballarina preparing for her role in a children's production of &quot;The Nutcracker.&quot; Krementz' beautiful black and white photography and simple- but-not-sappy text is wonderful. This book is especially appropriate for 5 to 10 year olds but will be treasured for a lifetime. The children in the &quot;Very Young&quot; books are all real. &quot;A Very Young Ballerina&quot; can open the door into the world of dance for a young person by showing what another young person has acheived. It can also open the door into the world at large and show that their dreams are attainable. I highly recommend this book for any young person or the young at heart who still believe the world is a beautiful place."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"When I was a kid in the late 1970's I checked this book out of the library as well as others from the \\"Very Young\\" series frequently. The kids in these books were all wealthy New Yorkers who had opportunities that weren't available to kids like me in rural Maine - reading these books allowed me to experience their lives in an isolated kind of way. Of all of those books, this is my least favorite. It takes the reader through a year in the life of a 10 year old ballet dancer in New York City. We see her en route from her private school to the ballet studio for lessons and at home in her bedroom doing homework. The book culminates in a lead performance in the Nutcracker. As much as I believe she was talented and worked hard, I couldn't help but feel she didn't really love ballet or perhaps she was uncomfortable being the subject of a book. The kids in A Very Young Skater, Rider and Gymnast seemed to genuinely love what they were doing and that enthusiasm really came across in the text and the photos. In this book, that enthusiasm was somehow lacking.I recently purchased a copy of this book and the other books mentioned from the series for my 7 year old daughter. She likes them and flicks through them often, but they don't have the same impact on her as they did on me. Perhaps that's because she has done ballet since she was 2 and has had many other opportunities like the kids in the books, so to her their lives are not considered extraordinary. I've enjoyed reading the books again after so many years & even though they are dated, the message is still relevant. If you love something, are willing to work hard at it and are lucky enough to have the emotional and financial support of your family, you can live your dreams."},{"Title":"A Very Young Dancer","review":"I am currently 44 years old and own a dance school.

I just can't believe I'm the first person to review this movie; hasn't everyone been haunted by Dracula's Dog?"},{"Title":"The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit","review":"The unapologetic underlying message in this travelogue of forbidden fruits is a resounding libertarian one: don't ban stuff, instead, let intelligent adults make up their own minds about what they put in their bodies. And it has to be said that the book makes a fairly convincing case for the notion that free will should trump governmental decree (at least when it comes to what we ingest). Each of the nine chapters takes Canadian journalist Grescoe to a foreign land in search of a forbidden experience (only some of which are food-based), and his wonderfully assured writing takes the reader along for the ride.First we visit Norway in search of hjemmebrent, which is essentially moonshine. There he finds a government willing to let junkies literally die in the streets while filling state coffers with massive liquor taxes. Naturally, this means there's a booming smuggling industry and as a corollary, many people who indulge in distilling their own spirits. It's a very curious dichotomy, the country has the world's 2nd highest GNP per capita and the most restrictive alcohol laws outside the Islamic world. This affords Grescoe the license to examine the history of prohibitionist movements and alcohol consumption trends around the world. Next up is Singapore, where he tests the prohibition on poppy seeds, chewing gum, being naked with his window open, downloading porn, and other such activities. This chapter doesn't really fit so well into the book's framework, as he's not actually seeking any particular item out, so much as he is testing the concept of prohibition in general. It's also rather irksome because although his behavior is essentially \\"research\\" for the book, he is fulfilling the stereotype of the Western tourist who ignores local laws and customs because he feels like it. Fortunately, we are soon whisked back to the world of gourmandry in the next chapter, which visits small French villages in search of \\"Epoisse\\"s cheese, a raw milk cheese banned for import into the U.S. by the FDA. Grescoe's investigation pretty much demolishes any scientific basis for this ban, and provides a wonderful example of how perception can trump fact in policymaking.Madrid is the next venue, where Grescoe tramps from tapas bar to tapas bar in an attempt to scare up a plate of bull testicles. This provides the chance to delve into the politics of meat safety and the European Union, not to mention sampling other Spanish oddities of fare such as baby eels (at $10 a forkful). Then it's back to North America, where he hits San Francisco and New York in an examination of public smoking bans. While I'm a huge fan of smoking bans in general, it's hard to argue with his proposition that bars could choose to choose to be non-smoking or not, and letting the market decide. The notorious liquor absinthe is next on the list, and Grescoe's historical review of the drink is somewhat surprising. Around the start of WWI an alliance of wine merchants and temperance advocates combined to ban the drink in most European countries based on little more than hype. The symptoms of the \\"madness\\" it supposedly induced can more readily be attributed to high alcohol consumption than any active agent in absinthe. Here, his quest for \\"authentic\\" absinthe takes him through into small towns along the French/Swiss border where arguments rage over what \\"true\\" absinthe is.The subsequent chapter opens with a history of caffeine and discussion of what constitutes addiction before ending up in the Basque town of Bayonne. Here Grescoe briefly samples the town's famous chocolate and points out how the chocolate trade was hijacked by the town elders from the Jews who had made it famous. In Bolivia, Grescoe checks out the coca leaf, in both its brewed and chewable forms. This allows for a scathing discussion of America's so-called \\"War on Drugs\\", highlighting its simultaneous futility and hypocrisy. The globe-trotting ends with the ultimate nightcap, a trip to Switzerland to meet with a firm which offers assisted suicide services to those living in other countries where this is not permitted (aka suicide tourists).The topics are covered in Grecoe's trademark engaging blend of personal experience, reportage, interviews with social science researchers, scientists, and government officials, all well-laced with statistics from authoritative sources such as the World Health Organization. He's a very good writer, able to switch smoothly from travel magazine style descriptions of place and customs to interviews with stuffed shirts, all spiced with bursts of indignation, bemusement, and wit. While armchair travels and gourmands will find much to enjoy, libertarians will love the message that governmental restrictions are usually based on either bad data, hypocritical morals, money, or a combination of all three. A fun and thoughtful book."},{"Title":"The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit","review":"The Devil's Picnic is a fascinating, engaging collection of stories about what we put into our body and why governments try to stop us. It is a joy of a romp, one man's tireless pursuit of the history of prohibitions and their failure around the world. The author looks at the big question of why we must be protected from ourselves, while showing how individual prohibitions reflect the history or society where they are in force--and who can make a buck by keeping something off the shelves.It's a lively and fun adventure, with more questions than answers in the end. There's the philosophical dilemma of how a banned substance becomes more desirable, except when maybe when you're talking about cigarettes or something else that will obviously kill you. There's the question of why countries like Norway would rather have distillers making their own booze for home use than make it easier to purchase the legal stuff at a reasonable price.The extensive pure research is presented in a compelling way, but is enlivened by an impressive number of interviews with key players in a variety of countries, from important government figures to people on the street. A strong dose of self-effacement helps also, as the author gamely drinks Norwegian moonshine, gets tanked on absinthe, and starts chain-smoking again to see life from the perspective of a smoker in the city. He ingests plates of offal that would make even the most hungry carnivores retch.Along the way he touches on nearly every prohibition and its consequences throughout the ages, from the Opium Wars to the banning of absinthe to the current debate over assisted suicide. The issues are always a bit gray of course. \\"As a species, Homo sapiens has always been in need of some restraint,\\" he notes and in modern-day New York City, \\"maintaining a pack-a-day habit would cost a New Yorker the same as a round-the-world plane ticket.\\" But then again, \\"What a society ends up stigmatizing is often more revealing of its own phobias and prejudices than the inherent nefariousness of the substance in question.\\" In other words, we ban what we're afraid of--and often we're just afraid of each other."},{"Title":"The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit","review":"This is a very informative and interesting book about prohibited substances. I was really surprised by how much this book captivated me. The facts, history and current status of these substances are cleverly woven together with wonderful writing, colorful interviews and great travels. Well done, Taras!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit","review":"If it's banned, Grescoe wants it. This means he has to bend rules and break laws. These are risks he's prepared to take, purely in the name of journalism, you understand.Canadian journalist Taras Grescoe's risks allow us to experience second-hand such exotic and forbidden delicacies as unpasteurized cheese from France and tea made from coca leaves in Bolivia. Actually, those delicacies aren't illegal in the countries where he samples them. So it's a bit odd when he goes to Singapore to eat poppy seed crackers. They're illegal in Singapore but not in Canada or anywhere else. Aside from that out-of-place chapter, The Devils' Picnic is a lot of fun. Grescoe has his hobby horse, which is that none of these forbidden items should be illegal and he makes a good case for that argument. But the best part of The Devil's Picnic is Grescoe hunting down the forbidden items and then sampling them. Sometimes it's worth the trouble, as with the epoisse (stinky cheese), but usually the forbidden fruit is a let-down (absinthe). And sometimes, he doesn't quite find what he's looking for, as when he inadvertently samples pig's testicles rather than the bull's testicles he was searching for.Along the way, Grescoe tells us the history of the comestible in question and interviews experts and it's all very informative in a magazine article manner. Grescoe tries to keep it light, but he seems inclined toward the dark side of things, so he ends with another slightly out-of-place chapter, in which he visits a clinic in Switzerland where you can end your own life with pentobarbital sodium. So be warned."},{"Title":"The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit","review":"The reviews for this book (including the one on the cover) compare the author to Anthony Bourdain, so I was expecting detailed descriptions of exotic food experiences. Instead, like Michael Pollan, the author uses his own experiences and explorations as a jumping off point for extensive research and discussion of public policies and how they affect our food and drink -- especially drink. The substances discussed are primarily intoxicants; only a few are foods. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating exploration of the effects of prohibitions in many countries."},{"Title":"The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit","review":"any author who starts by saying they are the traveling aliester crowley with a backpack is alright with me. grescoe takes us through a traveling journey around the world, trying out local food/drink that most of us would find as unsanitary, incomprehensible, and just plain disgusting. the stinky epoisses cheese made with raw milk, casu marzu cheese that is matured when it is infested with live maggots, moonshine from norway and much more gastronomic delights. grescoe interviews many people involved in the industry to find out the politics and history of the foods. and he is comfortable in challenging customs as he smuggles gum, pornography and poppy seed crackers into singapore. what's more than a culinary journey, grescoe goes into detail on the nature of prohibition. prohibition of drink, food and smoking. this is a highly recommended book if your are an extreme foodie."},{"Title":"The Complete Terrorism Survival Guide: How to Travel, Work and Live in Safety","review":"As a counterintelligence director with more than 25 years experience with a major international news organization, I have read scores of books and government documents pertaining to the terrorist threat and how to combat it. I have reviewed, with great dissatisfaction, the material provided by the Homeland Security Department, a multi-billion dollar federal bureaucracy with tens of thousands of employees. It is in this context that I read Mr. Aviv's masterful book. The Complete Terrorism Survival Guide is perhaps the best layman's guide to personal, family and business security in this age of great uncertainty and terror threat. Mr. Aviv neither overstates nor minimizes the threat, provides the average citizen with a set of practical tools for minimizing the risk, and provides a compendium of invaluable information, that would take a professional many months to compile and organize in one location. This book is a true public service, and one that deserves the widest possible circulation. For the average businessman who travels abroad, this is a must-pack item. For the housewife, worrying about security at the ultimate homefront--the home, the neighborhood, the school, the shopping mall--this is of equal value. Even though Mr. Aviv has written a book that is thoroughly readable, and comprehensible to the average citizen, he has also provided the insights that can only come from decades of on-the-job experience in the tough world of government and private security. As someone who frequently writes and lectures on international terrorism and related subjects, I can say that I truly found The Complete Terrorism Survival Guide to be a worthwhile read. I learned a great deal!"},{"Title":"The Complete Terrorism Survival Guide: How to Travel, Work and Live in Safety","review":"I thought I was pretty savvy about safety.

Who knew the dangers of divulging your mother's maiden name on a web site? Or sewing a US flag to your backpack? Or buying prescription drugs online? Not to mention the hazards of looking an abductor in the eye. Don't do it!Aviv's book is clear, comprehensive, and full of easy-to-digest (and vital) tips -- whether you want to know about protecting your pets, or surviving a nuclear attack.

I didnt want to miss anything and figured that a planner would keep me on track.My thoughts: Dont waste your money on this. I hardly used it. If you have a sister or friend, etc. who has been married in the past, just have then help you instead. All this does is give you a bunch of extra stuff you need to do. It is not necessary to do all the things this book tells you. I saw that most of what was in it, was a given. Book reception hall, priest, etc. get your bridesmaid's gifts, etc. Just basic knowledge.It is nice in that it gives you a timeline. For example, it will say \\"6 months prior to wedding\\" get this done. Or this done, etc. But if you just give yourself a year to plan, you will be fine. Just remember to book all the big things first. The hall, the food, the music, the priest. All else is just do it as you go along.This book is also in the form of a 3-ring binger. It is bulky. I didnt really even use it all that much. Very little. So if you are looking for a planner, get a smaller and simpler one maybe. You dont need this one.

I found his interpretations to be a bit far reaching, and at times absurd. Reed often goes on into his own &quot;poetic&quot; rantings and all too often describes what he see's to be comparisons between his own life and that of Rimbaud.

Maybe not in the sense that the author had intended, but in terms of its unadulerated representation of the chaos that is the source of all poetry, it is a promethean breakthrough. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Delirium: An Interpretation of Arthur Rimbaud","review":"&quot;delirium&quot; is nothing less than a work of creative genius, and i personally would be reluctant to criticize it for being 'self indulgent' when reading it is the linguistic equivalent of dropping acid or shooting up. it is that intense. after you finish it you immediately want another book by reed, or at least i certainly did. the source of poetry is free subjectivity and imagination, and there are parts in this book that are truly transcendent poetically. reed is interested in rimbaud when he was the 'god of adolescence', the period in his life of total rebellion and artistic frenzy. he does a near flawless job of showing that while verlaine and his somewhat cruel and hateful companion may have had a physical and shallow emotional bond, rimbaud was far above him on the spiritual and intellectual plane. this is a necessity for any admirer of rimbaud and surrealism."},{"Title":"Delirium: An Interpretation of Arthur Rimbaud","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It's all artsy and rebellious, possibly like Rimbaud himself. But oh, it is pretentious! It's like Reed took a straight-up Rimbaud biography, a lot of half-baked hippie rants, some political and social arguements which would have probably left the real Rimbaud scratching his head, and stuffed it all in a blender. (Set on puree, dry to a paste, spread it on paper. Voila, this book.) This is more the author's screaming than anything relevant to Rimbaud. If you want an artistic representation of Rimbaud's life, watch \\"Total Eclipse\\". If you want a Rimbaud biography, pick any other; they're all better than \\"Delirium\\"."},{"Title":"An Attorney's Guide to the Collection of Bad Debts","review":"This is more like an introduction and overview than a guide or a reference. Having read the book, I'm still not sure that the author means a guide for attorneys, rather than a guide by an attorney.The upside is that it is a quick read and contains a lot of sensible-sounding advice. The downside is that it is poorly edited and lacking in depth. The forms at the end are badly labeled, badly laid out, and nearly illegible. Also, they are specific to New York Courts and would be difficult to translate to other states. Part of the problem is that the New York statutes and rules the forms are designed to satisfy are, for the most part, not identified. Advice for collecting out of state is mostly just &quot;hire local counsel.&quot;Still, I would have paid to have lunch with the author to get his perspcetive on collections, and the book gives more than that for about the same cost in time."},{"Title":"An Attorney's Guide to the Collection of Bad Debts","review":"I agree with Mr. Keller: book reads more like a practical guide.It doesn't resemble a traditional treatise like Siegel's \\"New York Practice\\".

Terkel has collected stories from just about every conceivable category of people: teachers, politicians, clergy people, business people, young people, and old people, you name it, the group is probably represented in this book. Each oral history tells the story of someone who has maintained hope in a challenging or difficult moment. The situations vary, but each is meant to help us navigate in these very trying and uncertain days after September 11, 2001.In his introduction, Terkel says that \\"Hope never trickles down. It always springs up.\\" This book will certainly help people see that hope does spring up in third world countries, in violent city streets, in classrooms, churches, and just about everywhere else. This book will be helpful for just about anyone, whether facing a challenge or not. Teachers and clergy people will find the book very helpful since so much of the work of educators and members of eth clergy is keeping faith alive."},{"Title":"Hope Dies Last: Keeping The Faith In Troubled Times","review":"Terkel's system of personal stories told through the voices of his interviewees can be a bit disconcerting-just when you feel you are warming up to the person, the interview ends and we're off to someone else.

In this work, the answer is that we each have to fight the good fight and stay true to our ideals, regardless of our circumstances or backgrounds. As with his other works, there are ups and downs in these, but well worth the read--I particularly enjoyed the intro by Studs himself."},{"Title":"Hope Dies Last: Keeping The Faith In Troubled Times","review":"once again studs has nailed it inspirational timely and speaks to me today as it did years ago how i miss him but his words are still alive today"},{"Title":"Hope Dies Last: Keeping The Faith In Troubled Times","review":"Studs Terkel's interviews are always incisive and entertaining but this collection, at this particular moment in American history, is especially welcome.

Finally, Libya is accessible for foreign travelers - and, not less importantly, reasonably safe. Yet, given the relative lack of infrastructure, and as the volume of tourism is still low, travelers are unlikely to really experience Libya unless they are in a group, which may not always be pleasant. In order to truly get to know this wonderful nation, the independent traveler needs some help. And indeed, in this wonderful guidebook is contained plenty of useful, if not invaluable, advice, on what to see in Libya, how to move around, and how to have a great time altogether. The author has clearly put an incredible amount of time and great effort into researching all and any information that can be useful to the traveler, and has done a great job overall. To my knowledge, this is the best travel guide to Libya, and I would strongly recommend to pack it in your luggage before setting off. Yet, one aspect on which this guidebook is rather weak (compared for example to Lonely Planet guides), is on Libyan people and society. This means that the guidebook is a little better suited for those wishing to visit historical sites etc, rather than those wishing to get into Lybian politics, society, culture, and Lybian life in general. Yet, it is still a useful tool in that respect too."},{"Title":"Footprint Libya Handbook","review":"It is basically black & white plus in color three pages with 4 photos on each, one \\"big\\" country map on 2 pages, and one small on one page.

I am a researcher in this field and I find this book extremely valuable as the author explains everything in jargon-free language with examples to support his arguments.

I am tired of so many successive and more or less similar books full of photos that speak about the same historical facts, happened a lot of time ago (the World War II finished more than 60 years ago!!).I was looking for a coherent, modern and systematic explanation to the different battles that were telling me. Last book I found of this kind was Fuller's The Foundations of the Science of War (about war's principles -or \\"what to do\\" in war) wrote 80 years ago. It was reprinted in 1993 by the Marines, so must be excellent.I approached this new book with the own prejudices whom distrusts of finding already something of this type. With a look to the Index, you can see there is something interesting inside. In an unusual fashion, it is divided in many chapters, which are connected but can be read separately to deep in a theme you prefer.Its reading is pleasant and fluent, but it IS NOT a book for new comers in Military History."},{"Title":"On the Nature of War","review":"I took a look to the book and saw that it was about numerous land battles: Cowpens (Morgan in the War of Independence), Austerlitz, MacArthur in Inchon and North Korea, the rescue of the Duce by Otto Skorzeny, the assault on Eben Emael's Belgian fortress on May 1940, Walther Model's Operation Seydlitz on July 1942, Patton counterattack in the Ardennes on December 1944 and January 1945 and so on. When I read it I saw that its approach on them was special, not only a description but an explanation of how and why it happen.And this way it was deducing a theory of the war, synthesized in the \\"operational systems of maneuver\\". But I believe that they might have been called simply \\"operational systems\\", because not always they are about only maneuver.Additional the book is about the strategic, operational and tactical aspects of the asymmetrical irregular warfare with high insight and extension. In the first part of the book there is also a little but enough extension on generalities of war, to fix a frame to work out."},{"Title":"Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance: A Case of Transatlantic Bigamy","review":"Two worlds collide from across the Atlantic Ocean when a well-respected man is charged with the dishonorable crime of bigamy. The defendant, Francisco Noguerol de Ullua, is a true man of his time striving from humble beginnings to shake off the weight of his birth and claim glory in the Americas. His crime is the consequence of unfortunate circumstances of miscommunication, strained familiar relationships, and the resurrection of a dead wife. The Cooks chronicle these true events providing a peek into 16th century Spanish life and culture in the New World with commentary that is helpful and revealing. This book is crafted in a light that truly makes the events of 400 years ago come to life-an excellent choice for students of Latin American history, legal history, or social history. Maps, glossary, and a chronicle of events included."},{"Title":"Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance: A Case of Transatlantic Bigamy","review":"Not difficult to read, provides a look at many aspects of life in the Colonies and Iberia. Useful (especially for those who don't speak Spanish) references and maps in the back. I didn't give it five stars, however, because I think it was a bit choppy in the writing, jumping from place to place. I also think--even though I could be totally off the wall on this one--that the authors tried too hard to hide their bias for one of the women. I'm not much of a social historian, I'm much more of a structuralist, so I do recognize my own bias while reading this."},{"Title":"Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance: A Case of Transatlantic Bigamy","review":"I noticed another college student felt this book was a waste of their time, but I want to disagree. First off there is much to be learned about the Spanish legal system by reading this biography, and this book was on a recommended reading list our professor gave us for writing a mini-research paper for a colonial Latin American history course. Anyone who wants to learn more about Transatlantic communication in colonial Latin America would be interested in this volume, there is a lot to glean from it. This might not have been a book I would have discovered on my own, but it is certainly a book I enjoyed since the authors use descriptive detail and realism to bring long gone people to life. There are other books I have read for courses that might not have been enjoyable, but I always learned something. One big thing you can learn from reading this book is just how miscommunication often occurred as little as a hundred year ago, when people had to rely on letters for correspondence. Even though there is some evidence Noguerol may have known his first wife Beatriz was still alive after he married dona Catalina, for the most part he only had the letters his sisters wrote him to go upon. Today we live in a world where we are inundated with text messages and the 24/7 news cycle, so I believe people can learn a lot by realizing just how sparse and precarious communication was in the not so distant past."},{"Title":"Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance: A Case of Transatlantic Bigamy","review":"The title pretty much expresses my feelings about this book.

Chasing a dream, he completely loses touch with reality. Although on the surface it may seem that he is a white man gone native, Almayer hasn't got a clue what he is dealing with. He is blind to the schemings of his Malay wife and equally oblivious to the fact that his daughter is drifting away from him.Admittedly, the book has 'orientalist' overtones but, then, Joseph Conrad is both a man of his time and a master of poweful prose, not a politically-correct scholar. The stereotypical mystique of Asia and the inscrutable oriental are exploited as a literary means to descend into the deeper levels of man's psyche. Just like the 'true heart' of Borneo and its inhabitants is hidden under layer upon layer of deceiving images, so is the core of each and every individual. The scariest place to travel is not the interior of an Indonesian Island, but the inner reaches of our own soul.Almayer's Folly is one of the best novels ever written. Not only because of the author's masterful portrayals of character, but also due his astounding command of English. It is hard to believe that Conrad's first and second language were Polish and French: he only learned English as an adult. It is this combination of psychological understanding and extraordinary use of language that make him into a literary genius."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"This was Conrad's first novel, and I think it's an underappreciated jewel. It's written with a typical Victorian plotline, and one part of it has a romantic couple seeking their own happy ending, but don't be mistaken - it's real Conrad, so there's the glorious Conradian gloom, fear and descent into madness, too. It's a tale about a Dutchman in a business-gone-bad stranded in the Indonesian boondocks with his witch-like Malay wife who wishes him all the ill in the world. His only hope in life anymore is for his beautiful daughter and he dreams constantly of getting her educated and married off back in Amsterdam so he can wash his hands of his island nightmare and go back to normal life in Europe. But she grows up, grows distant to him, and he's clueless about the reality that she's adopted the local style and wants to be there. A handsome Balinese prince seeks her hand and the plot cranks into motion, spinning to a thrilling climax. It's an interesting study of problems of interracial, intercultural interaction, as valid today as it was in the late 19th century. The visual picture it paints of the old Dutch East Indies - the rivers, the tangled jungle flowers and the wildlife is another of its finest points."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"I was surprised to find out this was Conrad's first book. I expected an awkwardness of a writer refining his skill, but what I found was a captivating, accessible and satisfying story. It has suspense and romance as well as the tragedy that Conrad is known for. I think the young characters and themes make this book far more accessible to a young person than the standard required Conrad novel--Heart of Darkness. Almayer's Folly is an excellent introduction to Conrad's work."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"Almayer's folly is a powerful beginning to Conrad's second profession, writing. Since the story was written so close to Conrad's adventurous youth (the spring for his most powerful works), it provides the rawest expression of Conrad's views. Almayer, the prototype of Tuan Jim, takes the &quot;leap&quot; when he marries the Malay captive for promised wealth. This transgression drops his character into contact with the cold truths of nature; truths which dispel any artificial illusions or meanings. For Almayer, these illusions entailed sucess and fame in Europe, a place that he had never visited but only heard about from his mother. Superficially, this journey towards inner truth involves a journey into the wilds of Borneo, but,like in future Conrad works, we quickly realize that the journey is inward into the pysche of Almayer. Overall, an excellent introduction to Conrad."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"Almayer's tragedy is that he has become mired in an enterprise which has not paid off. His supply station just doesn't make him rich as he had hoped. In the meantime he has taken a wife, a Malay, and they have a daughter. So Almayer is mired in Malaysia in more ways than one. Almayer dreams of Europe but it is unlikely he will ever return. His fate is to rot in the tropics. Conrads tale of a hopeless colonial exploiter is interesting for its unsentimental, unidealized view of the whole colonial enterprise. It is seen as being a losing situation for both sides. Both cultures suffer. The most tragic figures are those whose heritage is divided between both cultures, exploiter and exploited. (This is something this years Nobel Laureate 2001 V.S. Naipaul, who is often compared to Conrad, writes about.) Conrads book has an appealing exotic side to it as well though. The descriptive writing of the winding rivers and foliage and the entire tropical setting is tempting as it attracts interesting types and seems to offer a life of indolence and easy riches and forbidden pleasures but of course there is a backlash. The plot itself is a winding river with many turns. Not a perfect book but an interesting book to read after having read many of Conrads later books. Conrad in his autobiographical A Personal Record describes his meeting with the character who inspired the fictive Almayer as being the beginning of his writing career. The whole colonial enterprise seemed to be embodied in the attitude and fate of that one isolated figure for him. I guess for that reason we can thank Almayer for existing."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"I refer to the Wordsworth Classics printing that contains the short stories 'Tales of Unrest'. 'Almayer's Folly' is an engaging novel that kept my interest despite being read in a haphazard way during travel. My favourite quote from the novel is: 'But a man busy contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready.' I enjoy the convoluted paragraphs that Conrad constructs that are surprisingly transparent for the reader - an extraordinary achievement for a man with English as his second language. He really does show the power of the language to richly counterpoint ideas of place and people. What, I wonder, was Conrad's skill with his native language? 'The Return' is a story of such mundane environment that I wondered if I was reading Conrad, but the unfolding of the narrative soon restores my impression. is there some Anna Kavan here? (or is Conrad in Kavan?)."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"Though overshadowed by his later work, Joseph Conrad's Almayer's Folly is one of the most impressive debut novels - excellent in itself and fascinating to fans and scholars in how it has in embryo so much of his later greatness. When we consider that he lacked literary training and did not learn English until his twenties, the accomplishment is near-unbelievable. All fans will of course want this, and its relative straight-forwardness makes it a good place for neophytes to start.Like most Conrad, the book can be thoroughly enjoyed on a very simple level as an adventure tale in an exotic locale. This story of nineteenth-century Borneo has much exciting drama: smuggling, international political intrigue, internecine rivalry and fighting, and much more. There is even a very moving and somewhat unconventional love story as well as a focus on domestic matters to which Conrad rarely returned. His depictions of the little-known landscape are also lush and memorable; he truly seems to bring to life a world very few Westerners know anything of even now with all its excitement and danger. These are the elements that initially got most attention, much to Conrad's chagrin because they were not his real point. However, they are still notable, and we can now enjoy all elements in proportion.The others are indeed noteworthy; it is truly nothing less than remarkable how much food for proverbial thought Conrad injects into this early work and how many themes later dealt with in more detail were already here. He would of course write many more stories featuring the sea and out-of-the-way locations, but these are only trappings for his tried and true themes, the most immediate being colonialism as well as the clash between Eastern and Western cultures, racism, and other ensuing factors. The story is set at a time when the Dutch and English both had interest in Borneo, dramatizing their profound and often destructive effect on the indigenous culture with stirring realism. The colonialism condemnation is not as overt as in later Conrad, but he spares no detail in depicting the havoc it wreaked. This debut novel interestingly focuses more on the native perspective than later works, giving a nuanced view and earning considerable sympathy for the oppressed culture. Indeed, in a true blow to Western ego, non-whites eventually triumph, and their constant cries against the \\"infidel\\" and benedictions of Allah's merciful Providence ring true.More important, though, is the tragic vision that all this symbolizes. Few writers - nay, few human beings - have been as pessimistic as Conrad, and he began at least as darkly as he ended. The appropriately named novel focuses mostly on its tragic title hero, who is not without admirable qualities but is simply unable to overcome his flaws. His dreams are big, but self-delusion, prejudice, greed, and narrow-mindedness ensure continuing failure and miserable destruction. The novel is a grand vista of individual tragedy; loathsome as Almayer is in many ways, he is arguably more sinned against than sinning. His truly wretched fate arouses much pathos, as does the emotion-drenched book generally. It paints a very grim picture of human ambition and the efficacy of communication - a truly moving tragedy to which many can unfortunately relate.As always with Conrad, the prose itself is also of great note. At about 130 pages, the story is very concise, and the prose is extremely precise yet highly evocative; Conrad's vocabulary is simply incredible, and his descriptions are profoundly memorable and often affecting whether about landscapes, love, or blighted hope. There are more signs of not being a native speaker than later, as he had yet to master the language, which will fascinate fans and scholars, but he already had a greater command than nearly all natives in the areas that make great literature.All told, while this does not make Conrad's very top tier, it is tantalizingly close; it is not only an incredible debut but would be nothing less than most writers' masterpiece, which is probably all that need be said.As for this edition, it is important to realize that, like others in the Dover Thrift series, it is bare bones - only a short headnote other than the text. Anyone wanting extra will need to look elsewhere, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"This was Conrad's first novel, first published in 1895. It is the start of a series of novels and stories set in South East Asia. He had first hand knowledge of the region due to his own work as a merchant sailor. He also knew a lot, obviously, from Alfred Russell Wallace's travel account The Malay Archipelago.Main themes of the story are the greed of colonialism and the racism of colonial routine. The story: a young colonial Dutchman, grown up in Java, takes a job as a clerk in a trading firm in Makassar, on the island of Celebes, keen to get rich. A legendarily rich merchant captain picks him as son in law for his adopted Malay daughter from pirate background, offers him a job as station manager in Borneo, with prospects of a huge inheritance.All goes wrong. The business fails over the years, not the least due to Almayer's lack of social intelligence. The fortune of the father in law dwindles. The station is unable to compete or even coexist with the local ruler and an Arab competitor. The marriage fails, partly because Almayer is a racist, partly because the wife has other ideas of the world, as one would expect from a Sulu pirate. He invests his emotions in a beautiful daughter and dreams of settling in Europe with her, after striking it rich. He dreams of a Borneo El Dorado. He understands nothing and nobody, certainly not his daughter, who can not see the charm in the prospect of settling in Amsterdam. She prefers to fall in love with a Balinese prince, betting on the local half of her heritage.The historical background is the Dutch consolidation of their rule in the region that later became Indonesia. Borneo is yet hardly under control. A definition of British and Dutch interests and boundaries was still to come. Aceh was rebelling against Dutch rule, as they would later against Javanese rule. Bali is still independant and fiercely determined to remain so. That's why the Balinese prince shows up in Borneo, he is looking for gunpowder. Which in turn quickens Almayer's downfall, since the colonial rulers see him as an unreliable subject who trades with insurgents.A problem with the novel is the total lack of redeeming features in the damned fool Almayer. He is so much not a positive hero, that his failure fails to touch us as tragedy. But the man is real. The world is full of such people.Conrad's start into the writer's career was not the top of his achievements, but for me, it is one of my favorites among his works. This is partly due to a personal relation to the locations."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"Although not to be compared with his major works, this is nonetheless a most impressive first novel. Perhaps because he was already well into his thirties when he wrote and published it, the book contains all the major themes that one associates with Conrad. If one has not read any Conrad at all, I would recommend going to his great masterpieces first (VICTORY, NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, THE NIGGER OF THE 'NARCISSUS', or LORD JIM). But for anyone who enjoys the work of Joseph Conrad, this book can hardly fail to fascinate."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"As this is Conrad's first novel, it is not fair to expect the sort of power that illuminates his later works. However, Almayer's Folly is a good, solid novel which shows the potential for Conrad's later greatness. A love story at its heart, Almayer's Folly also provides a last look at classical imperialism and the crossroads of multiple cultures. A short novel, I would heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"Though overshadowed by his later work, Joseph Conrad's Almayer's Folly is one of the most impressive debut novels - excellent in itself and fascinating to fans and scholars in how it has in embryo so much of his later greatness. When we consider that he lacked literary training and did not learn English until his twenties, the accomplishment is near-unbelievable. All fans will of course want this, and its relative straight-forwardness makes it a good place for neophytes to start.Like most Conrad, the book can be thoroughly enjoyed on a very simple level as an adventure tale in an exotic locale. This story of nineteenth-century Borneo has much exciting drama: smuggling, international political intrigue, internecine rivalry and fighting, and much more. There is even a very moving and somewhat unconventional love story as well as a focus on domestic matters to which Conrad rarely returned. His depictions of the little-known landscape are also lush and memorable; he truly seems to bring to life a world very few Westerners know anything of even now with all its excitement and danger. These are the elements that initially got most attention, much to Conrad's chagrin because they were not his real point. However, they are still notable, and we can now enjoy all elements in proportion.The others are indeed noteworthy; it is truly nothing less than remarkable how much food for proverbial thought Conrad injects into this early work and how many themes later dealt with in more detail were already here. He would of course write many more stories featuring the sea and out-of-the-way locations, but these are only trappings for his tried and true themes, the most immediate being colonialism as well as the clash between Eastern and Western cultures, racism, and other ensuing factors. The story is set at a time when the Dutch and English both had interest in Borneo, dramatizing their profound and often destructive effect on the indigenous culture with stirring realism. The colonialism condemnation is not as overt as in later Conrad, but he spares no detail in depicting the havoc it wreaked. This debut novel interestingly focuses more on the native perspective than later works, giving a nuanced view and earning considerable sympathy for the oppressed culture. Indeed, in a true blow to Western ego, non-whites eventually triumph, and their constant cries against the \\"infidel\\" and benedictions of Allah's merciful Providence ring true.More important, though, is the tragic vision that all this symbolizes. Few writers - nay, few human beings - have been as pessimistic as Conrad, and he began at least as darkly as he ended. The appropriately named novel focuses mostly on its tragic title hero, who is not without admirable qualities but is simply unable to overcome his flaws. His dreams are big, but self-delusion, prejudice, greed, and narrow-mindedness ensure continuing failure and miserable destruction. The novel is a grand vista of individual tragedy; loathsome as Almayer is in many ways, he is arguably more sinned against than sinning. His truly wretched fate arouses much pathos, as does the emotion-drenched book generally. It paints a very grim picture of human ambition and the efficacy of communication - a truly moving tragedy to which many can unfortunately relate.As always with Conrad, the prose itself is also of great note. At about 130 pages, the story is very concise, and the prose is extremely precise yet highly evocative; Conrad's vocabulary is simply incredible, and his descriptions are profoundly memorable and often affecting whether about landscapes, love, or blighted hope. There are more signs of not being a native speaker than later, as he had yet to master the language, which will fascinate fans and scholars, but he already had a greater command than nearly all natives in the areas that make great literature.All told, while this does not make Conrad's very top tier, it is tantalizingly close; it is not only an incredible debut but would be nothing less than most writers' masterpiece, which is probably all that need be said."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"This tale, set in the colonial-era East Indies, narrates the brief rise and slow descent of a man's search for fortune and adventure. Quite simply, the treasure never appears and Almayer is left to ponder what could have been. His woes are intensified by the departure of his daughter, one of his few links to &quot;civilised Europe.&quot; Classic symbolism occurs late in the novel, as Almayer erases the footprints of his daughter the day of their parting. While &quot;Almayer's Folly&quot; doesn't reach the heights of Conrad's longer (read: better) works, this effort still captures the romantic essence of the Far East in the classic Conrad style."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"Almayer's Folly was Joseph Conrad's first novel. I have nothing to compare it to, as I have not read his signature work, Heart of Darkness, nor any of his other lesser known stories and novels. I came into the possession of Almayer's Folly by chance; one of my friend's mothers had taken the book from the DISCARD pile in the library and urged me to take it from her.I'm glad that fate has brought me this book. It's the story of Almayer-- a Dutchman who has been born and raised in Colonial Indonesia. He spends his life idolizing Europe and Western ideals, scorning his homeland. Yet he never once ventures to Europe. In fact, most of his interactions with Europeans often find him the butt of their jokes. He doesn't fare much better with the Malay natives and Arab merchants--while often treated as a superior by virtue of his race, they still regard him as a fool.Almayer has nothing but haughty contempt for the native Malay culture of Borneo. Even with his Malay wife and half-Malay daughter, he keeps a Imperialist's distance from the culture which surrounds him. Feeling no true kinship with his European heritage, and scorning the one with which he is most familiar, he's a case study in the pathologies which arise from Colonialism.Essentially, Almayer is a semi-sympathetic buffoon. His life is full of grandiose wishes and little reward. He yearns for great treasure, yet is no warrior and a mediocre businessman. He lacks the cunning and courage of many other characters--A Malay Rajah, a slave, an Arab trader, and a swashbuckling British compatriot, are just a few of the characters who outshine Almayer.Yet, its his weaknesses which make his placement as the central character one of the most endearing aspects of the book. Because he is such a fragile, inept person, we become more comfortable with the savageness, intelligence, and verve in the other principal characters.Almayer's undramatic life serves as the backdrop for the love story between his daughter and a handsome Balinese Prince. Her choice to eschew a comfortable European upbringing and to align herself with the romantic, savage culture of her Malay mother is the emotional keystone in the novel.I was often astounded by Conrad's rich evocation of the setting and characters in colonial Indonesia. I'm not much for florid, lush descriptions, but Conrad sets himself above the heap of dilettantes and impostors: his ornate narrative holds together, forming a monumental, often breathtaking vision of Colonial Indonesia. The dynamic characters, expansive forests, and socio-political themes all receive the same rigorous, beautiful treatment.One drawback is that, because Conrad's talents are so visible and easy to explain, the mystery and magic in great pieces of art is obscured in this work. Furthermore, his characters seem to vacillate unnaturally between mythical, cliched representations of themes and truly organic, dynamic beings. That being said, the novel was a thoroughly enjoyable read and I am excited to soon discover some of Conrad's more well known works."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"\\"Almayer's Folly\\" adequately introduces the theme of culture conflict, an angle that is expressed more fully in Conrad's later works. I would certainly recommend this to anyone familiar with Conrad's body of work, which is not to say that readers new to his work should avoid this novel."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"This excellent short novel is very representative for Joseph Conrad's work. Its main theme of the foolish, dangerous and deadly dreams of colonialists was also treated in his short story \`An Outpost of Progress' (in 'Tales of Unrest') and in his masterpiece \`Heart of Darkness'.The main character in this story dreams of finding a mysterious treasure in order to be able to return to his homeland and live for the rest of his life in \`untold wealth'.For the indigenous, he is not more than another \`white man that comes to us to trade, with prayers on his lips and loaded guns in his hands.' He shows \`the same manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing the uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes.'He is bitterly confronted with \`the savage mood which civilization could never destroy'.For Conrad, \`no two beings understand each other', so certainly not the \`savage' and the \`white man'.More, the \`uncompromising sincerity of Malay kinsmen' stands in sharp contrast with \`the sleek hypocrisy of white people with their vivid but foolish dreams'.This novel has not the same high standard as \`Heart of Darkness', but should not be missed."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"This book by Conrad is a love story and a tragedy. The tragedy of Nina's father, Almayer--and the love story of Dain and Nina.But Almayer's Folly is not as great a book as Lord Jim or Nigger of the 'Narcissus,' which are among the great masterpieces of literature.There are several problems with Conrad's novel. For one thing, Almayer is not sympathetic enough to be a tragic hero. He just comes across as a real jerk. For another, the love story of Dain and Nina is so overblown and romantic as to be almost laughable, comic, and ridiculous. The characters and settings are hard to keep straight, as are the motivations of some of the doings.Frankly, I found it quite difficult to take any of it seriously. It may be that we are just too distant from Conrad's Borneo in time and place, but this is not a problem in some of Conrad's other novels.This is an inferior piece of literature. (Why the three stars in that case, you ask. Conrad's writing is so skilled in detail, and the setting and some of the other details so interesting, that the novel is absorbing--and mercifully short.)"},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly (Modern Classics)","review":"An alternative title for this novel could be Amayer's rut.For that is the situation that the main protagonist in this novel finds himself in. Almayer is a European trader living in atrading post somewhere in Indonesia or Malaysia with his daughter,a product of mixed marriage.Almayer dreams of escaping to Europe after making himself wealthy and bringing his daughter with him also.But as time drags on it becomes obvious that he is going nowhere with his life. He is not getting richer nor is he getting any younger. His own daughter ends up deserting him by eloping with a native who takes her to his own village.Not being a pure European by blood she realizes that she would never be accepted as an equal among Europeans or the whites.For this reason she chooses instead to live with the natives.As for Almayer he remains as he was.He is an example that one can find everywhere in the world.Someone stuck in a situation going nowhere but always dreaming of getting out and changing his life."},{"Title":"Musical Acoustics","review":"This book is a welcome addition to my technical library; & I'm using it in basicresearch for a monograph on \\"Sound\\" that I'm writing.It's gratifying that older books are still available, at a modest price.I would appreciate a list of technical books, especialy Dover Reprint Paperbacks.My other interests include Music & Amateur Radio."},{"Title":"The Harmony Guide to Aran and Fair Isle Knitting: Patterns, Techniques and Stitches","review":"As a knitter for eight years, I found this book a valuable resource for designing afghans and baby clothing for my family.

It is a useful textbook but offer little challenge to the religious precommitments that the reader may hold.This volume is a bit dry as it covers religious antiquity, classical times, and modernity. It lays out in a straightforward manner the religions of Egypt, China, India, Greece, Near East, Far East, and the West. The volume finishes with the great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. There is a lot of discussion of essential doctrines, rituals, and culture within this acceptable introduction to comparative religions.Herein one will learn about vital elements of:- Prehistoric religion- Tribal religions in Asia- Early Australasia- Traditional Africa- Aztecs and Mayas- Andean religion- Northern Europe in the Iron Age- Mesopotamia- Ancient Egypt gods- Ancient Greece pantheon of gods- Ancient Rome- Ancient Iran- Hinduism in its diversity- Jainism- Sikhism- Buddhism- Judaism- Christianity- IslamI as a stout Christian do not endorse its assumptions. I affirm an exclusive view of the person and work of Christ. Carroll noted: \\"If you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there\\" (Lewis Carroll).-------------------------------------------------------I would add: A tale is told of a very artistic spider that built a beautiful and awe-inspiring web; it was a wonderful work of art. Many came to see its magnificence and symmetrical splendor. It was engineered with great precision and complexity. The little spider was glad that his work astonished so many. This motivated him to keep good and exact maintenance over it. Correspondingly, he would tighten a cord here and there, and then strengthen a string on the other side. One day, he noticed a large thread that didn't look useful. So, he cut it with his fangs, and as he bit through it, the whole web collapsed; and the little bug fell to the ground. The thread that he had just cut was the one essential thread that the whole web depended on. Once cut, it collapsed. Similarly, the Triune God is the grounding thread for a coherent web of beliefs (presuppositions). Those who reject Christian theism will tumble down into absurdity. The God of the Bible alone provides the foundation to attach a worldview that is both beautiful and enduring.I contend that Christianity alone provides the rational and moral necessities for intelligibility. That Christianity must be presupposed to make sense out of human experience. The non-Christian world religions deny Christian truth and leave the adherent into irrationality and disapproval. All men behave in rational and moral ways. However, only Christianity can account for the laws of reason and moral absolutes on which morality depends.The only ground for the necessary pre-essentials of the transcendent, atemporal, universal, and immutable laws of logic would have to be able to account for these pre-essentials by furnishing a ground, as Yahweh does, that is transcendent, atemporal, universal in knowledge, and immutable. A capricious monad god, Vishnu within polytheism or Poseidon within the college of gods do not offer these pre-essentials; and all the false deities fail to provide the rational and moral preconditions that Christianity delivers.\\"What do I love when I love my God? Not the sweet harmony of song, not the fragrance of perfumes, not manna or honey, but when I love my God, I love a certain light.\\" (Augustine).An epistemological ground that contains universals, changeless forms, and moral law cannot be overturned by appeals to experience. It deals with the required pre-environment to make experience intelligible. Since the laws of logic and fixed moral law are necessary to make experience intelligible, one cannot appeal to experience that is in constant flux to undermine them. Intelligible experience presupposes the laws of logic. Thus, A is A (Law of Identity) and A cannot be A and Non-A at the same time in the same manner (Law of Non-contradiction). What can supply the preconditions for these laws? Yahweh alone. No other deity has the attributes, the ontological essence, and epistemic credentials to supply these preconditions.\\"I believe that all roads lead to the same place. We're taking different ways to get there, but we all end up in the same place. It's kind of like Kinky Friedman's statement, \\"May the God of your choice bless you\\"' (singer Willie Nelson).\\"Ned, have you thought about one of the other major religions? They're all pretty much the same (Lovejoy from\\" The Simpsons).The vital task of the thinking person is the task of criticism of falsehoods and rational inconsistencies. Many in the West believe that all religions are wacky myths or that they are all basically the same. This is prima facie not true and is self-refuting. Even the ultra-tolerant Newsweek magazine in 2007 admitted that \\"it is a fantasy to imagine that the world's two largest faiths (Christianity and Islam) are in any meaningful sense the same.\\" Hindus, Newagers, Buddhists, and multifarious atheists believe that all religions are essentially alike; on the contrary, the religions disagree on almost every religious question. Christianity teaches that one is a sinner in need of a Savior and one is saved by grace through faith alone. Buddhists and Hindus believe that this world is an illusion. Buddhists focus on liberation from suffering and the self. Islam believes that the Trinity is false and that one must obey Allah to gain Paradise. Religion and anti-theism have fueled many wars and conflicts in history. Most multiculturalists deny that religions and cultures are dissimilar and incompatible. They insist that tolerance is the key to everyone \\"getting along.\\" Some aspects and doctrines in diverse religions are similar. The entire field of world religions, but one (Christianity), profess that one has to work to merit his salvation or religious goals. It is believed to be possible through God's grace conjoined with the contribution of religionists. Christianity is the only religion that denies this proposition. The Christian faith alone contravenes the notion that salvation is grace plus works. One is saved by grace alone inasmuch as Jesus died on the cross for His people's sins and rose from the dead on the third day. All of the architects of various religions died and stayed in their graves, except for Christ. Newsweek added that it is a shibboleth that \\"all religions are the same.\\"This magnificent volume explains the doctrines, myths, symbolism, and rituals of religions past and present."},{"Title":"Cupid Calling (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"A titled gentleman, without an heir, usually re-marries.

The descriptions of Puritanical life are quite well drawn, and -- as a Native New Englander -- somewhat familiar. I can see how my view of the world has been shaped by my Puritanical New England ancestors. This characterization, more than anything, is probably what made the book so compelling for me (and not surprisingly, not obvious to my daughter). I can highly recommend this book -- unless you are 9. :-)"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; when I was fourteen.

In fact, this novel replaced my longstanding favorite book, Jane Eyre, as it slowly but surely crept its way up to number 1. I loved it; it's awesome; what else do I need to say?

Kit dislikes the life of the pilgrim; she finds refuge at the house of an old lady at Blackbird Pond. The book does a great job describing the history of this time period which is probably why it won the award.However, I was seriously disapointed with the story itself.One of the main problems being that there is no plot of which to speak. Kit goes the U.S., nothing else happens, FINALLY, at long last the story ends. Also, while I'm sure the author envisioned Kit as a strong willed character, they do not show it very well; also there really isn't any character development either, unless you count the last three pages.Wondering why I chose to read this if I hated it so much? I didn't choose, it was assigned for school reading.Oh yeah, there is no actual \\"witch\\" of Blackbird Pond (lady, but not witch). So, in conclusion, only read this if you want to die of boredom."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The book \\"The Witch Of Blackbird Pond\\" was a book that I wouldn't read again. The author, Elizabeth George Speare, could not get all the details in a way that could keep my attention, or my imagination running wild. Towards the middle the author made kit seem like a beauty queen, she had about three guys wanting to court her, John Holbrook liked her on the ship along with Nathaniel Eaton. When she finally got to Wethersfield there was a guy named William Ashby was courting her and came to her house after seeing her in the Meeting (church) and then William asked Kits uncle (Mathew Wood.) Although I do not like how magnificent and marvelous the author made Kit Tyler seem, I did like the two characters Prudence and Mercy. Prudence was a little girl that was not allowed to see or speak to Kit Tyler. Prudence's mother thought that Prudence was a child that was too thick or dense to go to school and learn. Mercy was Kit Tyler's cousin. She was crippled. Mercy was a sweet girl that taught small children how to read in her kitchen. I would not recommend this book. It is not very well written for young adults for the 21st century."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book was one I read in sixth grade and it was dull and slow. Not great and I usually love books about witches for I am very interested in the topic and it is not unusual for I live in Massachusettts and as you know in Salem, Massachusetts was where they hanged witches. But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England.

So it is with reluctance that I give it one star.If you want to read a historical fiction book that gives our founders an UGLY and untrue stereotype, THIS is the book for you. It is categorized as imaginary and it certainly is. There is no truth to it and does NOT represent the times it writes about. It is a pity that young people are being exposed to \\"historical fiction\\" like this.The Puritans were \\"strict\\" people but with loving hearts. They worked hard and had high moral ideals. Their high standards were Bible based. These two facts repulse people today. The Puritans were also well educated people. In fact they had better educations than kids have today! Puritans were \\"prejudiced\\" against sinful behavior as we should all be but we aren't in todays society. The oppposite of this is what is endorsed in our society today. Today what is right is wrong and what is wrong is right. You'll get more of the endorsement of what is wrong is right thourgh reading this book. In the near future, I expect authors like this to be writing about the \\"social justice\\" of Marxism and having kids and adults LOVE it!As an original source historian, it is clear that this author has no knowledge of the time she writes about and is giving kids and \\"adults\\" a false view of history. The book is slow and often boring. The plot is predictable once you realize that the author HATES any form of Christianity. The author is adamant in getting across her lowly opinion of Quakers and Puritans.I am also not surprised the academic LEFT loved it and awarded it the Yearling Newberry - it helps trash America's beginnings and makes them out of be irrational extremists. Unfortunately that is very much in vogue today. So if you have an axe to grind with Christianity, specifically Puritans and Quakers, you'll love this book! It will feed your hatred of those Christians. It was very disappointing and definitely very BIASED with UGLY inaccurate sterotypes.Homeschoolers - pass on this. It's a waste of time. Yes, it's imaginary all right but using the ugliest of Christian sterotypes to try to keep your attention and hav eyou believe this is how it was in those times - WRONG!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book is about some girl from Barbados named Kit Tyler who has to move to Wethersfield, Connecticut. First of all, the characters are the most boring people in the world. The plot stinks. There barely is a plot. I like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way. This book, there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground (just to let you know I'm being metaphoric here) and then go up a little hill. The only reason I actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where Kit is running away is kind of suspenseful. Just don't read this book it isn't good."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"A thoughtless and spoiled girl thrusts herself uninvited on her poor relations, then pouts and simmers in hostile resentment over the unintended consequences of her hasty actions. She scorns the virtue and work ethic that give her uncle's family the edge to survive in their harsh colonial environment, shirking her chores and remaining dispirited. Truly, Kit Tyler is a poor example for graciousness, duty, or manners.Time and again, we see Kit run away from her responsibilities, leaving the bulk of the hard work for her lame-in-one-leg cousin. She is too immature to understand the knife's edge her newfound community walks, trying to stave off famine. Only the pitched effort of every able-bodied person can ensure that the crops are planted and tended, the clothing is made and mended, the children are taught to read and write and cipher, the harvest is brought in before the frost. These villagers have no buffer; it is either work now or starve later. Their culture has sprung up as a way to reinforce the discipline and self-control that is needed. Kit is oblivious to these community norms; even the ones that are explained to her she shrugs off as ridiculous.But all is not lost, because there are outsiders in town, and Kit befriends THEM. The service she performs for Hannah and her patient teaching of Prudence make Kit almost likeable. Almost. The townspeople accuse Kit of witchcraft because of her inability to fit in, and finally she realizes the goodness and decency of her uncle's family as they try to shield her from the peril she has brought upon herself.Along the way, Kit gains insight into the beauty of simplicity and order. She feels the exhiliration of the seasonal changes in New England. We rejoice over the love she discovers.Happy ending to a silly book. Good vocabulary, and good for conversations about rushing to judgment."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Kit Tyler traveled to Connecticut to live with her aunt and uncle after the death of her grandfather. She had to contribute to their family farm. This is very hard for Kit because she is used to having slaves do all of her work for her. I don't really know what it is like to have chores like hers but I do know that change is very hard. After a few weeks Kit feels unwanted and as if she can't do anything right. One day, she meets an old woman. Kit's aunt and uncle tell her never to go back. The people in the town believe she is a witch. Kit disobeys her uncle and goes back to the old woman. A disease descends on the town and the town accuses the old woman of witchcraft. They also accuse Kit of witchcraft because of her association with the old woman.This is a short summary of the award winning \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\". This isn't my favorite book. I have read a lot of books, good and bad. Although this is a well-written book, I don't really like the idea of witchcraft. Also, the most suspenseful part is when she is in court and being accused of witchcraft. But this part is very short. I like books that have long suspenseful parts. This way, you have to stop in the middle of it, predict what might happen, and hold your breath until you can find out what happens the next time you pick up the book.The part that I do like about the book is that it really shows you how Kit feels. I feel really bad for her. She is accused of things she didn't do and she has to change her ways and that I know is very hard. It is even harder when your family doesn't even care.You should read this book if you like stories about girls who struggle to fit into a new life and you don't mind that it's not so exciting."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch Of Blackbird PondThis novel was not the best I have read. Sure, it was OK, but I have read books that are much better. It had parts that I liked to read, but the majority of the book was slow and hard to understand. It might have been better, had the author made less filer and more storyline. I got the key portions of the plot, but it was hard to understand most of the minor characters in the story. The main parts I understood I liked, but during the important parts I usually did not understand what was happening. There are books that are much better, so go and read something else. For the average reader, this is a very hard to understand book that I would not recommend. Basicly, this book had some parts that were good that I enjoyed, but most of the time it was hard to understand. Now, this is my view of the novel, and other people might have a different opinion than I, so if you have read other reviews and choose to read this novel, hey, I'm not stopping you.

Some of the things I didn't like about this book are that it talked a lot about political things and their religion. One part I liked the most was when Kit and Hannah were being accused as witches. Another part I liked was when the little girl thought that her doll was possessed and she threw it out then she wanted it back.

That is how I felt while I was reading this book about a 16 year old girl who has to move to the unfamiliar Connecticut colony to live with her relatives because her father has died and she has nowhere else to go. Everything is so different from her sunny Carribean home where she has lived most of her life.This book takes place in 1687 in a small town in Connecticut called Weathersfield, a stern puritan community. Kit Tyler, the 16 year old, comes to live with her Aunt and Uncle after her father's death. Even after she settles in to her new life, she starts to feel caged like a bird. She is unhappy and unliked by the townspeople because she acts so differently. For example, she wears expensive silk dresses, knows how to swim and becomes friends with the local witch. She meets the local witch, named Hanna, in the meadows, by the swamp, the only place Kit can feel completely free. Her association with Hanna and the fact that Kit is different form the townspeople cause her to be accused of witchcraft. Can she prove to them she is not guity of witchcraft before it is too late?The reason I like the book was because of the strong, action-filled plot. I also liked reading this book because it had portrayed the time period in which it took place accurately. The book seemed very plausible that a town in those days could panic and accuse a stranger of being a witch. I also liked the book because I liked the main character. Kit is someone that I would like to have met because she is independent, and wants to be accepted for being different. One thing I didn't like was the town's atmosphere. The atmosphere was dark, and strict, and loaded with witch hysteria.I would recommend this book to people who like the genre of historical fiction, and particularly the time period of witchcraft. This book would appeal to those in sixth to eighth grade who are studying this time in American history. This book is more for teenage girls than boys given it female main character and narrator. There is also a love story in the subplot that would appeal to those who like romance. If you have read and liked the novel \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", this is another good book to read.The climax of the story is when the main character is tried for being a witch. This review is not going to give away the outcome of the trial, but it is a strong finish to a well told story that will not disappoint the reader. I guarantee it! The conclusion will leave you feeling that almost anyone could be found guilty of breaking strict traditions in this stern peritian community where this book takes place. Can Kit escape the town's accusations and find happiness in this cold region, so unlike her native home?"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I thought that the Witch of Blackbird pond was a fairly boring story.

And also, if you're going to read this book, I don't recommend that you should read it if you are under the age of 10.

If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong.

I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet.

I guess if you're into olden times, witch hunts, arguments, and \\"romance\\" I guess it would be fine, but it wasn't my favorite book.I'll just kinda give you a brief telling of what the book is about.It starts out that a girl named Kit is sailing from Barbados which is in the West Indies and is headed to stay with her Aunt and her family in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Then she just is really outof place. She has different customs and just doesn't fit in. Her uncle isn't glad she's there and neither are other important people in the township. It's kinda just a lot of mishaps and bad things happen to Kit. Then she befriends a \\"witch\\". It's just aboutr her I guess gaining trust and her beginning to fit in.The end was just kinda like \\"blah\\". It's just kinda like Kit falls of the face of the earth, although wshe does live \\"happily ever after\\". As most books do unless they're horrors.I think that i8f you just wanted to relax it wasn't a good book to read because you had to thyink about what you were reading.

The feel of the time period is pervading, and the book's lure lies in it's unusual storyline and the fast-paced, constantly twisting plot.Kit Tyler is a young girl from Barbados who is orphaned and must leave her paradise to the cold comfort of her Uncle's Puritan farm. She feels out of place, until she discovers the Meadow. She soon becomes fast friends with Hanna, the Quaker woman who lives by Blackbird Pond, and is accused of witchcraft by association.This book is stunning. The characters and events are so real that you can see them. Everything is so vivid, from the first words of the book to the suprising conclusion. This book makes my top ten list!!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book about a girl adjusting to a new environment is a very warm touching book. If I was Kit, I probably wouldn't have been able to survive going to Lecture, mass, and enduring all the hard work. i felt really sorry for kit because she had to do all the work that her slave used to do. One thing good about that is that she learned to do a lot things during her life in Whethersfield. I think that kit was pretty lucky, however, because she got a lot of support from her &quot;family&quot;. She had found friends that stood by her. She also had proved to others that she was useful. I think that in the end, it was really nice the way it turned out that Judith got to marry William, Mercy with John Holbrok, and Kit with Nat. They were all nice matches and I am sure they would turn out to be all happy because that's who they wanted to be with."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Don't let 249 pages scare you because once you have read past the first few the book's length won't matter: You'll not stop for anything! Suspense will grow to the unbearable, filling you with emotions: anger, love, sadness, fear, and relief. The old woman, Widow Tupper, was said to be a witch, but she has mysteriously disappeared. And strong rumor has it that sixteen-year-old Kit has taken her place as a witch. And what happens to witches?

I thought it was excellent! The story begins when Kit, an orphan girl from Barbados goes to Connecticut. She lives with her stern aunt and uncle there, and eventually becomes friends with her cousins. At first she has a lot of trouble fitting in. She's not used to hard work and living in a cold climate. She can't wear her old clothes either. Then one day she meets the Quaker widow, Hannah, who lives on the marshes. They become friends and soon she meets up with Nat, the son of the captain of the ship she came on. She winds up going to Hannah's cottage more and more, even though her aunt and uncle have forbade her to because Hannah is thought to be a witch. She becomes friends with Nat and gives secret reading and writing lessons to a neglected little girl. Meanwhile, at home, Kit and her cousins Judith and Mercy are having their own problems. Kit dreams persistantly of going home to Barbados. You sort of have a love triangle with Judith, Mercy and John. Then, a rich young man named William wants to marry Kit. Nat gets caught illuminating William's house with Jack o' lanterns, for obvious reasons to everyone but Kit, and is put in the stocks. It all comes to a head one day when people start accusing Hannah of practising witch-craft on their animals and children. Kit overhears and runs to get Hannah safely away on Nat's ship after the mob burns her house. Later the next day, she is arrested because people think she was the witch's apprentice. How will she escape? Will she see Nat again and mend things between them? And most of all, will she get her happy ending by going back to Barbados, or something much different?

Being the Heiress to your grandfather's sugar cane plantation would mean no work, all play. Life would be great, swimming in the warm waters all day, being free to read one of the many books that your Grandfather owns right? You wouldn't have to clean either, with your many slaves. In most homes in the 1600's, a 16 year old would be expected to perform many tasks like cleaning, sewing, and cooking. This is how Kit Tyler's life was, perfectNever in her life did Kit have to do backbreaking work. She would soon find out what it was like on the other side. Due to an unfortunate situation, Kit is forced to leave her home on the Dolphin, and head toward her aunt Rachel and uncle Mathew's home in Connecticut. Kit, and her cousins Marcy and Judith work all day, doing the work that Kit considered slave's work.Everything Kit did was the wrong thing in this house. She was even stirring the soap wrong! She was forbidden to help a sweet old widow named Hanna Tupper with anything because the woman was a Quaker. Kit had gone to see her anyway. Because of this she was accused of being a witch. Hanna Tupper was also accused of witchcraft, but Kit managed to help her get away from the angry mob. Hanna's home was burnt to the ground, so she went to live with the mother of Kit's friend Nat.For anyone that's wondering why this Book is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond, it's because Hanna Tupper lived at the edge of a pond, Blackbird pond. In my opinion, this is a great book. If you like realistic fiction books, or books that take place long ago, than you will love this book too."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I was looking for good book to send to my sister's children. I loved Elizabeth George Speare work, not just \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" but also \\"The Bronze Bow.\\"I was shocked at some of the recent reviews. Why worry about your kid using marajuana, a constant dose of Hollywood is far worst.I read this book in the early seventies, also \\"The Bronze Bow\\". This was an inspiration for me to investigate history. I have since gotten my Master's in History. No, I haven't made any money with my degree. It seems that writing about the way it really was isn't PC.Personnally I think I would rather be accussed of being a witch than being PC."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Spears was a great novel. I think it was very heart touching and reflects many peoples lives today. It has life morals and teaches about friendship, courage and love. The book also shows how people lived in Colonial times.Spears did a wonderful job bringing her characters to life. They each had there own personalities and feelings. For instance, Kit was very wise but stubborn throughout the book. She came to America to live with her Aunt and Uncle and was at first rich. She had many fine clothes and could swim. A very different character from Kit would be Matthew Wood. He was very serious about everything and doesn't believe in nonsense such as witches or Hallows Eve. He was also very fierce and political man. He fights and tries to get everyone to do or believe what he does. He sticks to what he believes in and does not give up until he has proved everyone else wrong. For example, he will never change his religion and people against are forbidden from the house.Spears also had a good plot and kept the novel full of suspense and action. It was also very adventurous. In one event, a plague gets the village people angry, causing chaos and a witch-hunt. They go and finding the witch not there burn down her house. Where was the so-called witch? Was she really a nice old lady like Kit made her seem? Who saved her from the village and brought her to a safe place? Read the book and you will know the answers to these suspenseful questions. Another great event was in the courtroom. While burning the house a lady finds a hornbook belonging to Kit with her daughter's name, Prudence on it! In the courtroom, they decide the punishment and if Kit is really a witch. Does her Uncle stick up for her? Will Prudence come help Kit? Did Kit really write the name?I hope that after reading my review on The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Spear you will read the novel. It taught me lessons on friendship, and bravery. It was filled with happiness, sorrow, and love shared by all of the characters and the reader. Thus, read the novel and prepare to be taken into the novel yourself!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book is good.

It's not really about a witch, its about people & how easily people can simply make superficial judgements of others. The main character is displaced from her home & has to start a life in the colonies & thus hangs a tale. There is also some Jane Austin storytelling going on which doesn't feel out of place at all. Although this book may be aimed at young readers, I found it simply wonderful. Not to be missed & one that can easily be read over & over again."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I wanted something short that was considered a classic. I must have picked this book because of the Newbery Medal. I like to purchase books for my grandchildren, and since I hadn't read this before (for some reason), I bought it. The writing was tight and well done. The title and the picture of Kit on the cover threw me off; I was glad the witch wasn't her--until later. One can read the story outline in other reviews. Suffice it to say, I am tremendously glad I read this book--finally--I graduated from college in 1958. So it's not just for young adults, as many of the reviewers have noted.

Actually, I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but I've re-read this book about ten times in the past year. I just can't get enough of it!

It has been on my to-read list since I was young. I've enjoyed the other novels written by Speare and was glad to finally get a chance to read this Newberry award winning novel for adolescents. Thoughtful and precise with fiesty characters, The Witch of Blackbird Pond is exactly the type of book I hope that I can encourage my own children to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Although this book was published over 50 years ago in 1958, the story and writing are as accessible as ever to a new audience.Kit Tyler is a sixteen year old orphan who has grown up under the loving care of her wealthy grandfather in the Caribbean isle of Barbados. Kit's youth is freewheeling and carefree until her grandfather dies and she is startled to discover that he was heavily in debt. After settling the estate, Kit is forced to leave Barbados and impetuously decides to board a ship to Wethersfield, a Puritan town in Connecticut, where her Aunt Rachel lives. While on the ship, Kit begins to realise that her upbringing and ways of thought are not only strange to the Puritans, but are considered unwelcome and downright dangerous. Her ability to read and swim, her luxurious silk dresses, and her lack of piousness startle her shipmates - John Holbrooke, a shy young man studying to be a minister, and even Nat Eaton, the quick witted and fiery first mate.Kit arrives in Wethersfield and is aghast to see how small, provincial and colourless it is compared to the fine towns in Barbados. She arrives to a startled but warm welcome from her Aunt Rachel and her cousin Mercy, but her dour Uncle Matthew and beautiful but sulky cousin Judith are leas welcoming. Kit struggles to find her place in her new surroundings, which seem to block her every effort at forming connections with others, whether it is with young Prudence Cruff, or with the mysterious woman who lives in the Great Meadow. Kit persists on creating her own world and puts her new family at risk when she is accused of witchcraft by the increasingly intolerant and fearful townspeople. This book has enthralling adventure, family tension, and even a bit of gentle romance. The secondary characters spring to life and their stories are followed as well. For those of you worried about the witchcraft or magic themes, there is no actual magic practiced in the book. Characters are accused of being witches, but at no point is it ever portrayed or even suggested that any of the characters were actually either able or desirous of performing witchcraft. Witchcraft is depicted in a historical light as an example of scapegoating and intolerance. There are no fantasy elements.The Witch of Blackbird Pond has been treasured by young readers for over 50 years for its timelessness and and superb writing. This book was truly deserving of its Newbery Medal and the author's other books including The Sign of the Beaver and The Bronze Bow continue to captivate new audiences. Enjoy and pass this on to a new generation!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I originally read this way back in jr. high and sadly only remember being entranced by it--not recalling any of the plot. I finally got around to the rereading and recalled why I had the original feeling of enchantment. This is one good book.Kit Tyler is a sixteen-year-old girl who leaves Barbados after her grandfather's death for the more austere world of Puritan New England to say with her aunt's family. But Kit is completely unprepared for the ways of these people. Even so, she manages to grow in unimaginable ways as she connects with people with whom she would have never seen herself.And it's not a simple moralistic book. It's a book about a girl coming of age. Unlike other books of the Puritans, there are no villains, just those who are different and it's amazing to see Kit come to understand that.The characters are entrancing and dimensional, the setting is described in an honest prose that only shows Speare's love of New England.It deserves its Newberry."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book is definitely worth reading several times.

It is a great book for all to read!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read this great, great story as a kid, and I'm not sure I've ever learned more from one book.At that age, seeing the protagonist (a good girl!) consider marrying for social reasons, not romantic ones, was revolutionary for me. This portrait of the English colonies, the Puritans, the tropical plantations, the slavery, the daily life in 1600s New Hampshire were a very entertaining education.This book is a little girly. Romance is a major theme.In addition to history, this book teaches a lot about getting along with people vastly different from yourself without giving up your identity."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is one of the best children's books I have ever read. Elizabeth George Speare's superior writing pulls you in from the very beginning and never lets you go until you read the last words in this book. She has made a rather vague period in time come alive with vivid colors and life. The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a must read for all ages."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I had to read this book for school and I kind of liked it. Some of it was entertaining but a lot of the words were hard and it was confusing because of the way they talked. It was hard to understand. But mostly, I liked it.The book takes place in 1687 and is about a teenage girl named Kit Tyler. She lives on her grandfather's plantation on the island of Barbados. The weather is always sunny and nice and she can swim and play all day and doesn't have to do any work. One day, Kit's grandfather suddenly dies and she is left with no money so she has to go on a ship called the \\"Dolphin\\" to live with her aunt and uncle and her two cousins, Mercy and Judith in a Puritan colony of Connecticut. Life is a lot harder because she has to work all the time and the weather is not nice like it was in Barbados. The people are very religious and strict and she feels like she doesn't fit in. She takes a job as a school teacher but the schoolmaster doesn't like the way she is teaching so he fires her. One day, she meets a kind woman named Hannah Tupper who lives in the meadows. Hannah is very nice to her and she likes to visit her. But when Kit tells her aunt and uncle that she is seeing Hannah, they tell her that she can't see her anymore because she is a witch. Kit disobeys her aunt and uncle and decides to keep seeing Hannah. One day, when she is at Hannah's, a man comes and it turns out to be Nat, who she had met on the boat coming over and they became good friends. During the cold winter, many people in the town get very sick, including Mercy. The people think that Hannah has put a spell on everyone and that's why they are sick. The people go to Hannah's house to arrest her and put her on trial for using witchcraft. Kit gets to her first and hides her and the townspeople burn down her house. Kit gets Hannah on the \\"Dolphin\\" and she goes to a safe town. Her aunt and uncle and the people of the town find out that she has helped Hannah and think that she is also a witch. They arrest her and during the trial they accuse her of witchcraft. Her friend Nat comes to help her and gets her out of trouble. Nat leaves for the sea again and Kit is very homesick for Barbados. She is thinking of leaving and going back there, but she realizes that it's not Barbados that she is homesick for, it is Nat. She realizes that she loves him. At the end, Nat comes back and says that he loves her too."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"it was a very good romantic historical book that was full of adventure and exitment.

I think just the fact that I came back to this book as an adult some 20 years later speaks volumes. It is, of course, written for young readers, so don't expect it to delve deeply into themes it brings up of cultural transition and democracy.

BOTTOM LINE: Worth reading."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond deserves 5 stars because Kit always surprises the reader. For example, most readers would think Kit is going to like Wethersfield but when she arrived it was a major dissapointment to her. Another case is when Kit did not marry William, one of the most eligible bacheleors. The following reasons are why this book deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book is a classic. The main character, Kit, is a strong role model for society today. She shows that through perseverance, she can overcome life's struggles. Through her struggles, she shows others around her that prejudice is unacceptable.Looking at Kit's struggles to survive in a society she is not used to, a young adult can easily relate to her. Young adults struggle with all sorts of issues growing up. Even though Kit's problems are inherently different than those of young adults today, there are many similarities that young adults can relate to, such as fitting in.It's a shame that because a book is written well and depicts the life and times of people from over three centuries ago, it's considered horrible and boring.I read this book over fifteen years ago, and read it again in college, and the book still has the same effect on me. It's still a favorite book, and as a teacher, I will recommend it to my students as a mandatory book."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I tought this book was ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC!

This book is about a girl who moves across the world in the 1600's and is accused of witchcaft. there is also some romance between some of the characters and all of the love is sorted out by the end of the story.

It's compelling, but yet some parts are dull. It portrays the tradgedy of a young girl in a situation where she is forced to leave her beautiful island home of Barbbados, as an orphan, and live with her aunt, uncle and cousins, whom she has never seen. It expresses her trials and tribulations of adjusting to New England life with full detail, but little irony.

The author gives you a good perspective of how life was in America, 1687. She also explains characters well; like Nat's mocking eyes, or Mercy's quick hands. Kit has so many suitors, that you don't know who is really her true love until the last few sentences of the book. I would recommend this book to any middle school student of either sex."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I really liked this novel and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.

Having recently lost her grandfather, she's come to the colonies to live with her uncle and aunt. But her new town is completely different from her old life in Barbados. Not only does she have to do the chores she used to have servants do, but her Puritan relatives are much stricter then her previous upbringing has taught her to be.But her life isn't all bad. There is the interest William, the most eligible bachelor in town, has shown in her. And there's the refuge she's managed to find in Hannah, the town outcast suspected of being a witch. But will she ever truly adjust to her new life?I found this book in Jr. High, and have read it four or five times since then. I recently reread it again, and was completely drawn into the story. I couldn't put it down, and I already knew how it ended. The characters are sympathetic and interesting, especially Kit. You can help but root for her to find some happiness in her new life. The plot is engrossing, with several sub-plots expertly woven through the book. And the time and place of the setting is brought to life in such an amazing way it feels like you are actually in the town of Wethersfield.This book is so engrossing that anyone will love it. And the theme about judging others will stick with you long after you've read the last page. I can not recommend this book highly enough. Ms. Speare is an excellent author."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is set in Connecticut in the late 1600s. It tells the story of Kit Tyler, a 16-year-old girl who sails from Barbados to Connecticut after her grandfather passes away. Kit travels to Connecticut to live with her aunt and her aunt's family, none of who have met her and who do not know that she is coming. Connecticut was a Puritan community struggling for independence from England at this time and the culture shock is difficult for Kit, who grew up affluent and independent. The townspeople are not very welcoming to her and some believe to fear that she is a witch because she is different from them. Kit's troubles get worse when she becomes friends with an old Quaker woman people called the Witch of Blackbird Pond.I would recommend this book for ages 10 and up. Most children have felt like they didn't fit in at some point and will be able to relate to Kit. This book teaches children about tolerance, acceptance, and not being judgmental. I would use this book in a school setting as part of a social studies curriculum. It is appropriate for discussions about witch trials, Puritan history, and Connecticut history. I would also recommend this book for pleasure reading."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Although I am well past the age this book is intended for, I must say this is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction I have ever read.One of the favorite books of my youth was &quot;Calico Captive&quot; which was also written by Elizabeth George Speare. Recently, in a fit of nostalgia, I purchased &quot;Calico Captive&quot; and, on a whim, I also grabbed &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; simply because it was by the same author and also set in colonial times. I felt I could use some light, escapist reading material in order to take a break from my usual heavy fare of military history books.Anyway I started to read &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; at around 9:30 in the evening. At 2AM, I finished it. I couldn't put it down! After the first few chapters the book becomes a real page turner. I had to find out what would happen next. Would Kit ever adapt to the austere life of the Puritans? How would the situation with Prudence Cruff pan out? Would Kit marry William? Would John marry the girl he truly loved? Would Uncle Matthew ever soften? And, of course, what would happen if the Puritans found out about Kit's friendship with a suspected witch? I was just blown away by this book- one of the enjoyable reading experiences I have had in a long time."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond may be a work of fiction, but there are many parables with modern life. It's about a white girl, from the sunny West Indies, who moves to the cold, unwelcoming colonies in New England. Her uncle, a Puritan, reluctantly takes her in. Though they treat her as good as as their own children, they're clearly not happy to have her. For starters, the Puritans are serious people, and she's used to play and leisure. The Puritans are austere and Spartan, while she's used to flamboyant luxury. The family's life is preoccupied with hunting, farming, cooking, and cleaning; the kind of stuff one has to do in order to eat. She, however, comes from a wealthy family and has never even cooked for herself.But she learns. The family are Puritans after all, and it's their duty to teach her self-sufficiency. Soon she settles into the routine, cooking meals, cleaning, and teaching young children to read.But Puritan life comes with a problem. The people believe in the existence of witches, and anybody who appears unusual is a suspect. Hannah, a kindly old woman who lives alone, was once a suspected witch. She has a scar on her face as a reminder of how she suffered under the Puritans' paranoia. Worse, she's a Quaker, and the Quakers are despised by the Puritans.Faced with an inquisition-like investigation, she faces the harshness of the Colonial laws of the time. Judge's decisions are not based on codified laws, but on the religious and social mores and norms. Every single good thing she's done since arriving is suspected as an act of witchcraft and subversion.But there is hope. As with today's legal system, success depends on getting the right advocate! Will the townspeople stand up for her and denounce the witch hunts, or will she be tortured by religious hysteria?"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"A witch? Someone thinks you are a witch? When Kit leaves Barbados on the lovely Dolphin ship to live in America with her Uncle, she is unprepared for what she encounters. What a surprise when she discovers that being able to read, swim, wear fancy clothes, as well as befriending a kind old woman is odd behavior for this town. In The Witch of Blackbird Pond, Elizabeth George Spears sends you on a reading adventure. The story includes a number of surprising and suspenseful events including a frightening witch hunt and a big outcry among some angry villagers against their government. Some parts of the story are a little boring, but the elaborate language and unpredictable moments bring you right back into the book. The climax of this book is the best part. It's unbeleivable and exciting. The main character, Kit, is very interesting. You will feel like you know her only after reading a few pages. Fiesty, wise, and stubborn are some of Kit's personality traits. You will also become very familiar with many of the other characters including Kit's two cousins, her Aunt and Uncle, Nat a seaman, and John and William two very interesting men, plus many more!

They are the decendents of Roald Dahl and even as much as I am glad they are out there, I sometime wonder why there aren't more decendents of Frances Hodgson Burnett. Where are the sweetly serious books? This is one such decendant and more should be out there. The Witch of Blackbird Pond is an absolutely wonderful novel of historical fiction that throws early America into stark light. I read this book over and over when I was a child and though I have not read it in 15 or more years, I can still remeber the twists and turns of the plot. History is rekindled through Kit (I can still remember her name), a young emigrant just come to America to start a new life far from her natice Barbados. You see the grey winters, the hard working people whose religion shapes their daily lives, and the fear. Speare brings a small part of reality to life. And that is what is truly missing from so many modern children books. I truly recommend this book to all kids who have a thirst for the past."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I had to read this book as an assignment in 6th grade. Ten years later, I have re-read it 10 times. That's right, one time for every year! That's how much the story stuck in my mind.Rather than give away the plot, here's are a few reasons why The Witch of Blackbird Pond is so special to me, i.e. my favorite scenes:1. I really related to Kit Tyler and I still do. It's the feeling of being out of place, of not belonging and not being accepted, of having people try to change you, and then running away and finding the meadows and making friends such as Prudence and Hannah Tupper and finally feeling at peace.2. The scene when Kit accidently saw Mercy's love for John Holbrook and realized that Mercy loved him.3. The scene where Kit walked out of the door and saw her hated Uncle Matthew as a lonely, defiant figure clutching the soil of his land! It was there that she first started to respect the strength within him.4. And finally, without recounting all the sentimental parts of the book: I LOVE the character of Nat Eaton and all the scenes when Kit and Nat are together. Elizabeth George Spheres portrayed them with alot of subtle chemistry. They banter because they are, in truth, really attracted to each other. And Nat, despite his cocky attitude, really comes to Kit's rescue everytime. Coincidence?

Oh Well!!!The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a historical fiction novel that does a good job of portraying early colonial life.

After a long voyage, she finally sees the shore of the land that she will come to live at. She is not impressed. But, hey! You can't blame her.

The story of the girl who leaves her island home and must adjust to the harsh New England environment struck a chord with me, as I was a military kid and always moving from place to place. This story is about a girl who finds herself in a new environment that goes against everything she has ever learned or experienced, and she must learn who she is in order to survive this new land. It's also a romance story, and an intriguing story that shows what can happen when people become so closed-minded about what is \\"right\\" and \\"proper\\" that they refuse to look past a person's supposed subversive actions in order to really see or understand that person.

It was so good. Beneath all the historical stuff that can be really boring to people there was romance in it, which made it really sweet and enjoyable.Here is a summary of the book:Kit(katherine for short) Tyler is a free spirited girl from Barbados but has to move to the english colony of Conneticut where everyone is Puriten and very solemn. This girl was able to swim and was rich her whole life. So she was accustomed to never working and being able to swim and have fun all day. So you can already see the conflict there. Anyways, Kit leaves Barbados because her grandfather died and she had no wher to go and no money, because it turned out her \\"rich\\" grandpa was in debt. She sets sail on the Dolphin and there she meets Nat(Nathanial) Eaton and John Holbrook. Nat is the captains son, and at first she can get along with him ,but any minute they would start fighting. John is a man going to the same town as hers to study. When she gets there she realizes she doesnt fit in. Kit has to work all the time and go to church for hours upon hours. When she gets fired from her job as a dame school teacher she flees sobbing.She runs all the way to a meadow where \\"the witch of blackbird pond\\" lives. She is just a sweet, lonely, and old quaker. She befriends her and a lonely girl named Prudence who she teaches how to read. Hannah(the old lady) tells KIt of a seafaring friends of hers who turns out to be Nat. Nat comes to her house one day(hannah's) while Kits was there and she befriends hima Little more. In the cold winter many people in the town become sick and everyone blame Hannah because they thing they bewwitched all the sick people. So Kit saves her and sees the dolphin. So she had Nat take her away. Meanwhile a boy named William wants to marry Kit and she doesnt really wnat too. After Hannah \\"dissapeers\\" they suspect Kit of witchcraft, but Nat comes and kinda saves her. Then Nat leaved for sea voyage once again. Then william and Kit decide not to get married, and KIt continues being homesick.

Tolerance and acceptance are perhaps the biggest lessons of all to take away from it. Independence is another.

As they sailed up the river to Kit's new home, Kit was filled with apprehension about her unexpected arrival to her Aunts home. Kit was received by her Uncle in a less than welcoming manner though, her Aunt and two cousins Mercy and Judith were glad to have her. What she didn't count on, however, was how different, and hard, her aunt and uncle's grim, cheerless, and strict Puritan way of life was. The suspicious townsfolk looked upon her warring of satin gowns as frivolous, and her habit of questioning her elders as evil. When they learned she could read and swim, she was accused of being a witch. When Kit befriended Hannah Tupper, an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond it was more than the community could take. Yet, Kit learned that \\"Hannah Tupper was far from being a witch, but certainly she had worked a magic charm. In one short hour she had conjured away the rebellion that had been seething in [her] mind for weeks.\\" However, the townspeople didn't know this, or want to, and Kit was forced to save Hannah's life and defend her own.I loved this book!

I read it again a few years later and really enjoyed it. It has remained a sentimental favorite of mine all these years. I did want to respond to Annie's review below. I understand she may be a young girl who is somewhat possessive of her home state's claim to witch hunt fame, but witch hysteria took over all of New England at that time. Here is an excerpt from a website dealing with the history of Stamford, CT and surrounding areas:\\"The early codes of New England made witchcraft a capital offense. Religious and English precedents were considered as sufficient authority. Connecticut passed a law in 1642 which stated that \\"If any man or woman be a witch-that is, hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit-they shall be put to death.\\" In New Haven Colony the law declared that \\"If any person be a witch, he or she shall be put to death, according to Exod. 22.18, Levit.20.27, Deut.18.10,11.\\"Prior to the 1692 delusion numerous trials for witchcraft in Connecticut were held-at Windsor (1647), Wethersfield (1648, 1650-51), Stratford (1651), Fairfield (1653), New Haven (1655, 1657), Easthampton (1658), and Saybrook (1661). Ten persons were accused and placed under arrest in 1662 and four were tried, convicted and executed. The victims were the last individuals to suffer the death penalty for witchcraft in Connecticut. By 1692 court procedures relating to witchcraft were well established.\\"Ms. Spears does not have her history confused, but rather did excellent research toward writing this book. Recommended reading for all young folks interested in early American history."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"&quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond,&quot; by Elizabeth George Speare, is the story of Kit Tyler, a young woman from Barbados who in 1687 goes to live with relatives in Connecticut colony. Kit experiences quite a bit of culture shock. A key figure in the story is Hannah Tupper, an elderly neighbor suspected of witchcraft.This is a fascinating story, well told by Speare. The strong-willed Kit is an admirable character, and I really got caught up in her story. Speare offers an intriguing look at colonial era life and culture--the book is full of interesting details and thoughtful touches, such as a reference to colonial-era poet Anne Bradstreet.In a relatively short novel Speare touches on a rich assortment of colonial-era topics: religious difference, anti-Quaker bigotry, politics, education, fears of witchcraft, etc. All these things are skillfully woven into the compelling story. And Speare vividly describes the natural beauty of colonial Connecticut with the changing seasons.The book has a copyright date of 1958, so I would say that it has stood the test of time as a literary work. It's also a Newbery Medal winner. For a good companion text I would recommend a volume of Anne Bradstreet's poems."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I've recently just read this book despite the fact that I'm an older reader (not that old!).

She wonders if she would be happy with him. She longs for home, but at the same time longs for the meadows and her old, dear, friend who is under suspicion of the town for practicing witchcraft. And after a time she is also under suspicion of practicing witchcraft herself. This book says it is for ages 12 and up but I am 10 and I still enjoyed it very much. This book makes you long for the ending, to see whether she escapes from suspicion, and finds true love, or if she retuns home. It is old history from the year of 1687. It really brings out the feeling of this girl, Kit Tyler, as she struggles through this difficult life that her cousins, aunt and uncle live in. This difficult life of working days on end that she can barely grasp the hang of.

We were studying the Puritan Time period of history and this book was a wonderful depiction of the lifestyles and beliefs of people living during this period. The language was challenging in the beginning but the students were are to grasp the message of the book. We noted similarities with the main character Kit and the girls growing up in today's world.Kit portrays the life of a 16 year old girl amongst a new and unusual Puritan community. She is from a foreign shore and therefore she is disliked and thought of as suspicious (because she is different). Kit befriends a Quaker woman far outside of town, the two develop a wonderful relationship. The community casts scorn on the women and eventually Kit is scorned as well.This book was a wonderful teaching tool because it depicted how belief and presumption can cause great pain and suffering for individuals that have \\"different\\" beliefs, attitudes and feelings. It also helped my young students understand the tribulations of history and how being different can at times cost one their home, their lively hood and even their life. We had a lively discussion on how Kit remained strong and self assured among so much bitterness and hatred.This is a must read for any social studies class learning about Puritan history and the Salem Witch trials."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book is very applicable to everyday life.

She also met William Asby who wanted to marry her and Hannah Tupper known as the witch of blackbird pond. When ever she feels down and stressed,she goes to Hannah's and she also teaches a girl named Prudence how to read. When she tells her only family now about Hannah Tupper they tell her not to go there. However, Kit still goes there and she meets Hannah's seafaring friend Nat shoet for Nathaniel Eaton. There was a sickness going througout the town and they blamed it on Hannah. Kit went to go to help her escape. They burned her house and Kit and Hannah went where no one could see them and as the sun rose, she saw the Dolphin, the boat in which Nat would be on.Nat took Hannah to to his Mom in Saybrook and asked Kit if she wanted to go but she couldn't. Kit and William had a talk and decided that they should see other people. What ended up happening was John Holbrook and Mercy got married and Judith married William asby and it was a double wedding. Kit on the other hand had feelings about Nat but she didn't know what to do .Nat came back and said that he wanted to talk to her uncle about things ans then asked in a non direct way if she will marry him.I like the book because it keeps you intrested and the end is romantic and it has a really great ending.I didn't like it when Judith just assumed that John wanted to be with her because what she didn't know was that John liked Mercy and mercy liked John, the only preson other than John that knew was Kit.

Like when Kits uncle was furious when he saw his daughters in Kits fancy dresses and he said that they didn't need that stuff. Today almost anyone would be glad to get nice new clothes. Speare also did a wonderful job creating suspense. For example it was very suspenseful when the townspeople were going 2 Hannah's house with the torches because you didn't know if Hannah would be alright or not.

Unfettered by the community's prejudice, she befriends an Quaker woman who is judged with suspicion and almost hate by the rest of the community, because of her religion. Though the heroine's eyes and emotions, we see the injustice of religious intolerance; and an insightful child might extend that to thinking about intolerance of all kinds.

It was a historically accurate book. The writer did a great job displaying the emotions of each character. It made me know how I would feel during this time period coming in as an outsider.

She ends up being accused of a witch but a friend named Nat helps her out of it, with many good details along the way!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Kit Tyler's parents died when she was very young, and ever since she has been living with her grandfather in Barbados. When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch. She secretly becomes good friends with Widow Tupper, and the Widow helps her get her job back in the school, and secretly teaches Prudence how to read. Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what. I think this is a wonderful book for all ages, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as it did."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read this book as a kid and I never forgot it.

Many times, when we study early American settlement, we can't really imagine what it's like to come to an untamed wilderness with primitive homes and few neighbors. When I read this book, the whole 17th century colony of Connecticut came alive. I experienced everything as the main character, Kit, did. She experienced many struggles and tribulations, trying to adjust to such a strict settlement, while still missing her home. She experiences romance, hard labor and a gripping witch trial.

I faintly remembered having heard something about it when I was in fourth grade, so I decided to read it. The Witch of Blackbird Pond isn't hard at all to read (as long as you know your 'thees' and 'thous'), but it is still an excellant book. It tells of a story of a young girl from the Indies that was forced to come to New England to begin another life. As one might expect, she's not all that welcomed by her Puritan relatives. She struggles to fit in for a year, but nothing seems to work. I don't want to give anything away, but I really liked the way that this story was written because it sends an important message to the reader--You can't always get what you want. Nevertheless, it's a wonderful, short story, and I think that just about anyone would like it."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I loved this book and could not put it down.

The master of the house despised everything about her. The man, who claimed he loved her, abandoned her to the circle of terror. And there was nowhere to turn, no one to help, no way to escape the evil claiming her as a victim....\\" Sounds good doesn't it. This book is about a girl, Kit, who leaves the only home she has known and travels to Connecticut in 1687. Kit grew up in Barbados and was raised by her indulgent grandfather. When he dies, she moves in with an aunt and uncle she has never met. Everything about Kit stands out, from her clothes to her opinions. She is forced to work hard for the first time in her life. She is practically friendless until she meets Hannah. However their friendship must remain a secret because the town believes Hannah to be a witch. Elizabeth George Speare does a remarkable job in describing early life in the colonies and relaying the loneliness of Kit. You can't help feeling sorry for her.

Kit Tyler is an impulsive and genuine young woman with a very strong mind with whom I definitely identified with. In this time in Puritan society this description isn't one that you want nor was it for me for a long while. The ability to identify with at least one character is always a good indicator of a story because the whole idea is to walk in an other's shoes no matter how different they are from your own.Also as with all great stories they have lessons that you are meant to take away from the story if it fails to do this then in my opinion the story no matter how entertaining it was, it was a waste of time. In regard to this book it is thoroughly riddled with ideas and morals, some very unexpected given the time period.It taught me that sometimes you just won't fit in but that doesn't mean you should change your \\"feathers\\":\\"You know,\\" he said, looking carefully away at the river, \\"once ~hen I was a kid we went ashore at Jamaica,~ and in the marketplace there was a man with some birds for sale. They were sort of yellow- green with bright scarlet patches. I was bent on taking one home to my grandmother in Saybrook. But father explained it wasn't meant to live up here, that the birds here would scold and peck at it. Funny thing, that morning when we left you here in Wethersfield---all the way back to the ship all I could think of was that bird.\\" -Nat EatonIt taught me what love is and shouldn't be:\\"You and I would always be uneasy, ail of our lives. We would always be hoping for the other one to be different, and always being disappointed when it didn't happen. No matter how hard I tried, I know I could never care about the things that seem so important to you.\\" -Kit TylerIt taught me love is sometimes hidden right in front of you.It taught me truth and loyalty are two of the most important things in life.Most importantly be yourself for the right people will love you more for that and the ones that don't, don't matter.As far as did the author succeed in their story, read the following quotes.\\"I don't believe a historical novel should gloss over the pain and ugliness. But I do believe that the hero... should on the last page... still be standing with the strength to go to whatever the future may hold.\\" -Elizabeth George Speare\\"Every book begins with questions. How must it have seemed to people who lived through this experience? What choices would I have made in their place? I must find the answers by going back in the past, by living side by side with them until the world they lived in becomes as real to me as the room in which I am working. This is an enormously satisfying experience. I find that renewed perspective and a sort of reinforcement to the spirit...[are] gifts from the past that...a person of any age...can gain from reading...historical fiction.\\" -Elizabeth George SpeareIf I am to judge the story based on these then the author most definitely succeeded on all counts.As far as eye-candy when it comes to covers this is my favorite cover of all the editions of this book. I love how she looks free-spirited even in the strict clothing of the Puritans. I like how the artist included water in the background because the difference in the water was one of the first indicators that Kit was no longer in clear blue Barbados water but rather the murky water of Connecticut. The cover also gives a hint of the wooded way the North used to be like during that time before the Industrial Revolution.Overall I give this book a five. It is a book you will want to give to any girl coming of age, or any woman at a crossroads in her life. Personally, I pick up a copy of this book whenever I can and have several editions that sometimes if I have doubles I tend to give away."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This novel was not the best I have read. Sure, it was OK, but I have read books that are much better. It had parts that I liked to read, but the majority of the book was slow and hard to understand. It might have been better, had the author made less filer and more storyline. I got the key portions of the plot, but it was hard to understand most of the minor characters in the story. The main parts I understood I liked, but during the important parts I usually did not understand what was happening. There are books that are much better, so go and read something else. For the average reader, this is a very hard to understand book that I would not recommend. Basicly, this book had some parts that were good that I enjoyed, but most of the time it was hard to understand. Now, this is my view of the novel, and other people might have a different opinion than I, so if you have read other reviews and choose to read this novel, hey, I'm not stopping you. This review was my thought of the book. In all, this is not a very good novel to me."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Kit Tyler has to leave her beloved Barbados.

I mean once u start u want to finish. I starts with a girl moving into a whole new city, family, and life. Then is sort of turns into a big love triangle. One thing though is that at my age, 12, it was kinda hard to actually understand what was going on in some parts of the story. For example, the story would talk about the colonial days, around 1689, and religion was very important, and kings and queens wanted to buy land, and (very important part in the story) the people think if you can stay afloat water and swim, then u are considered a witch.

You won't be able to put it down until you are finished reading it. You learn a lot about the way that life was in colonial America while you are still reading an interesting story. This book is about a young girl named Kit who has just come from Barbados to America, to her aunt and uncle's house. Kit's grandfather had passed away so she had no other living relatives. In Barbados, an old but rich man had asked to marry her, but she had said no. Kit then decided to go to her aunt and uncle's house in Connecticut. There she is given work to do that she has never done before. Kit used to be rich and thought that slaves did the work that she is now doing herself. She feels as though her aunt and uncle do not want her. Then she meets an old and gentle woman named Hannah who is believed to be a witch. They quickly become friends.

I think that Mattew Wood was a very mean man and I think that Kit felt the same way, until he stood up for her when she was on trial.To me Judith didn't like the idea of Kit coming to live in Weathersfeild because she would lose attention, after a while she seemed to become nicer.Rachel and Mercy were alike to me because they both like the idea of Kit coming to live with them. On the other hand I wouldn't read the book for a couple or reasons. One is because everything happened to slowly, which made the story a little boring.Another reason why I didn't like the book is because some of the events were hard for me picture of in my head.Pictures would of helped a lot.Lastly,I didn't like this book because it was on a topic that didn't me, expecialy because I already read it once."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I don't feel that the author did too good of a job on the plot which was supposed to be on witches and witchcraft. The theme of a &quot;witch&quot; of Blackbird Pond was really not presented until close to the end of the book. In the beginning of the story when Kit jumped into the river to fetch Prudence's doll, and she was floating, Goodwife Cruff and other ship passengers accused her of witchcraft. It was much later that the whole story about Hannah Tupper came together. Waiting to the middle of the book to really start getting into the witches seems to weaken the book. To me, it took the author too long to get to the point. I lost interest in the story."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read the witch of blackbird pond.I didnt like or dislike this book.It had fantastic chapters an awful chapters.

It is about a girl named Kit Tyler who moved from Barbados, in the Caribbean, to live with her aunt in a New England colony in Connecticut because her grandfather died. She sailed on a ship called The Dolphin to get to Wethersfield, Connecticut to live with the Woods family. On the Dolphin she meets a lot of new friends, like Nat Eaton. When she gets to Wethersfield, she finds strict religion rules, hard labor, and pious settlers. She does find some new friends, like Nat Eaton, William Ashby, John Holbrook, and more. She also meets an old Quaker named Hannah Tupper, also known as The Witch of Blackbird. Even though the entire town hates Hannah, she is still a kind and affectionate person. When the friendship between Kit and the witch and most of the children are sick, they blame it on Kit and the witch, which brings the story to its climax. I gave this book a three-star rating because I thought the characters were innocuous and the plot was pretty crummy, but there was some action that caught my attention. I only chose this book because it was another assignment for school. At first, I thought the book was going to be about a dangerous, diabolical witch who was going to escaped a ruthless execution and the book was going to have lots of magic by looking at the cover, but boy was I wrong. There was hardly any magic in the book. The \\"witch\\" was only a Quaker, but I guess that the Puritans don't like them very much. The witch wasn't what I expected. I must say it did bring out the horrendous and scary part of living in the time of early settling and witch trails, even though there wasn't many witch trails. It could have been a lot better if there were fewer pages of Kit's agony, and more witch-like events. This book made me feel like a vacuum was sucking away my happiness. It made me feel like a drowsy, napping, drooling, uninterested, absent-minded dog, in a corner doing nothing. To be honest, I disliked the book because there wasn't much action until the end. I also disliked the book because the action doesn't come until much later. It could have been one hundred pages shorter because much of the book was about how she wasn't fitting in until the end. If you were looking for a Harry Potter book, Lord of the Rings book, or a magic book, don't look at this book. If you want a captivating Salem Witch Trial book, this book won't help. The title may mislead you. I will only recommend this book if you want to comprehend life of the early settlers and labor of early settlers. It's recommend to people who like to read books like The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. This book would probably be best for young adult or children readers because it's not too advance. Reminder, I didn't like it because it was too much talk and not enough action for me. Think about that before reading. Remember that I rated it only three stars. In conclusion, I think you should only get this book if you like to read about early settlement and books like The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. Only get this book if you what to read about a young girl struggling in her life with misery from her new home and getting help from family, friends, and the witch of Blackbird Pond. Some people said it was great. Personaly, i don't see anything great about it. Sorry, this might have been too long."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Overall, I was disappointed with this book. I don't mind long, slow, drawn-out plots as long as they are detailed and developed. By the middle of this book, I wondered when it would get started. By the last quarter of the book, I was still wondering when it would get started. Usually by the end of a book, I feel that I &quot;know&quot; the characters. This book left me feeling empty. The characters Judith and Mercy were poorly developed. I was almost finished with the book before I realized the differences and similarities between Judith and Mercy... I spent most of the book wondering who was who! As for the witch-hunt -- that was also disappointing. Kit and Hannah were not accused outright of being witches until the last three chapters. Only one chapter in the whole book is entirely devoted to the witch-hunt. Finally, at the end of the book, I was left feeling completely empty with Nat and Kit's relationship. It just came out of no where. I had a feeling they would get together in the beginning and I wanted to see them together, but I was really disappointed with the events that led up to it. What can I say positive about this book? It is a good historical fiction of Puritan times and lifestyle. If you are interested in the Puritan ways, you will probably like this book. If you are interested in the witch-hunt or if you want to read a well-developed good book, I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I was forced to read this book in school, and although some parts were interesting, the rest was so boring.

The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Witch Of Black Bird PondWritten by Elizabeth George SpearI did not like the book at all, I mean I liked portions of it but some of the parts were to uppity, and just a little too lackluster for me. Now the characters were a bit electrifying the Author put them I situations were they had a suspenseful yet intriguing. Nat was a bit gloomy he was an old fashioned fellow he wasn't as exhilarating as the other characters. Kit to me was a Miss Priss she kinda thought she was better than the others because she had superb attire and she was a Quaker and others were scandalous Puritans in her brain. I actually liked Mercy and Judith they were the sweet petites. I think that there characters had good personalities and were as exciting as my favorite parts on the Witch Trials now they are exclusive. The witch trials gave me a clear big screen view, front and center too. Now back to the whole idea I'm gonna tell you straight out what I think about the book.... Okay, I thought the book was old fashioned and boring except the witch trials of course. I thought it was a book my great, great, great, great, great, great grandma's, great, great, great uncle would read. It was that old style. I don't think I'll ever read that book again. Most people would take after their great, great, great, great,great grandma's, great, great, great uncle.

I rest my case."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond(1958). Elizabeth George Speare's Newberry Award Winning Novel.Throughout popular literature, Historical Fiction is either a delight to some or a horror(quite literally) novel to some. Judging from my past experiences, I'd say I would easily fall into the second category, as most become drab and inconsistent mid-way or partially through. When I was assigned to read 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' for Summer Reading, I took the novel on almost as a challenge and a burden at the same time. Anyways, with its 1958 release, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' received heavy critical acclaim, and even received the prestigious John Newberry Award and an ALA Notable Book Award. So, was 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' a surprisingly good novel, or a hopelessly jumbled mix of words? Read on to find out!Plot-16-Year old Katherine Taylor, fondly known as Kit, has left her dreamy Caribbean home for the dreary Puritan life of rural Connecticut. After her beloved Grandfather's death, the only way she could get away from lustful men(of 50!) and debts was to stow away on the 'Dolphin' for a ride to her Aunt's humble abode. Upon her arrival, she clearly doesn't fit in, as she was accustomed to a laid-back lifestyle, yet once the family brings her in, day in and day out, she works still sundown, and by then she's supposed to listen to lengthy preachings on the Bible. Her new frustrating lifestyle slowly eats away at her, and after she's dismissed from her job as a Dame Teacher, she breaks down and flees to the Green Meadows, a secluded patch of beautiful crops and flowers. There a widowed Quaker named Hannah Tupper finds her and consoles her, and the two quickly become fast friends. As the Summer turns into Winter though, the townspeople quickly become ill, and Hannah Tupper and Kit are accused of bringing a plague into town, or inciting Witchcraft. Kit and Hannah must learn to survive among their Puritan neighbors and overcome adversity, while still being friends.Writing/Opinions/Etc.-Unlike the Amazon Review reads, I DO NOT recommend this novel to anyone under 11 or 12, as they may have a tough time getting through this novel. With that out of the way, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', while being Historical Fiction, actually lets the reader imagine a time and a place unlike ours at all, when Satin dresses were considered unorthedox and Jack-O-Laterns \\"of the devil\\". Speare effectively transports the reader back into the lifestyle and the mindset of the Late 1600's, and following Kit through her troubles is actually surprisingly entertaining and enthralling, and I was positively waiting for what would happen next. Speare, unlike fellow \\"classic\\" writers doesn't bog down her writing and plot with lengthy and unneeded descriptions, likewise focusing on the plot yet using colorful language at the same time. On the down side, the plot is incredibly predictable and (at times) repetitive, but I won't take away any points because I felt this was a great novel for Teens.Overall, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' easily bested my expectations for the novel, and I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed a Historical-Fiction novel. Speare is a good writer and storyteller, and I wouldn't mind reading another novel of hers in the future. Of five Summer Reading novels, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' has BY FAR been the best.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF DRAMA AND ADVENTURE. THIS NOVEL IS SUITABLE FOR ANY AGES(EVEN ADULTS!), BUT I RECOMMEND THE READER BE OVER 10 AS THE WRITING MAY CONFUSE THEM OR BORE THEM. HAPPY READING!Also Recommended-Fighting Ground- AVIHarry Potter And the Goblet of Fire- J.K.

Another sure to be award winner is film and television actress Mary Beth Hurt who presents an exemplary reading of this story of a courageous young girl facing down the prejudices of Puritan New England.An orphan, Kit Tyler has a sense of foreboding as she views the unforgiving shores of Connecticut Colony where she will make her new home. She does have physical shelter but she is very much alone, yearning for the Caribbean Islands where she once lived.Kit finds release in the meadows where she befriends and is befriended by an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond.However, Kit's amity with the woman stirs a cauldron of suspicion and recrimination - Kit is accused of witchcraft.This is a well told tale that documents a sad portion of our history.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Kit Tyler was once a rich girl of Barbados, but upon her grandfather's death, she finds out with a shock that she is penniless. She goes aboard the ship, the Dolphin, heading for Connecticut Colony, and hopes for a better life at her aunt's house. While on the way, she befriends Nat Eaton, the captain's son; John Holbrook, a man planning on becoming a minister; and Prudence, a little girl. When she finally arrives at her destination, she tries hard to fit in with the Puritans, struggling to keep up with her lively cousin, Judith, and her gentle one, Mercy. After a fiasco of accidents in the household and outside, she finds becomes friends with an old Quaker that lives at Blackbird Pond, Hannah, who is said to be a witch. Kit does not believe this, and she keeps on being friends with the old woman. However, the villagers see Kit as a threat to the community, since they do not trust her as being a friend to their witch, and she goes on trial. Just as she thinks there is no hope, Nat Eaton and Prudence save her. However, Kit discovers that she will never fit in with the Puritans, and plan on going on the Dolphin the next time the ship came. Finally, the ship docks, and she goes on it, for what seems to be a much better future.The Witch of Blackbird Pond is an imaginative book. I like it for its originality, its spell bounding detail, and irresistible fantasies. Elizabeth George Speare did an excellent job in creating the characters. I have enjoyed Kit the most, for her difference in nature from the stuffy Puritans and her wild, untamed behavior. I have never really fit in with everyone else, for the same reasons as Kit. She dressed differently, her nature was unique, her feelings awkward to others. I have had those problems too, and I have also done things that others have not the courage to do. Although she lived in a different century, our feelings are uncannily the same.My favorite part of the book was where Kit goes on trial. I know it sounds cruel, but it is so interesting to hear how people react to their own problems and try to blame it on someone else. It's so ridiculous how people think of goats becoming sick and other small problems such as those, and turn them into major disasters performed by a witch. I like the part where Prudence comes in, and stuns her own parents by doing what they had never thought she would be able to do- reading the Bible and writing her own name. Often parents underestimate their children, and their children's power."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, next to 'Jacob Have I Loved'. It is INCREDIBLY engrossing. The Puritan setting is done in such a believable manner that you are sucked into the story. You can easily imagine yourself to be right there with Kit and enjoy every minute of it. Kit, as a heroine is very likeable and authentic. She begins the story with pride that borders on conceit and ends with a mature and well-tempered strength. Throughout the novel I got a kick from her defiant attitude and spirit. The relationships between all the characters in the story are the heart of the novel. While the mystery and action elements of 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' are well-done and could stand alone (the plot moves along very nicely), it's really the relationship aspects of the novel that appealed to me. I also have to mention that there are moments of fine humor that make me laugh out loud. I can't say that about many other books I've read. I will probably re-read this book many, many times. I think it's unfortunate that students are forced to read this book before they are ready to enjoy it. If you had to read this book for school and found it hard to get through, I would strongly recommend that you give it another shot when you're older. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Elizabeth George Speare managed to make one of the drier, duller eras of American history come alive through the eyes of an independent young woman. \\"Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" is one of the better historical novels, and one that adults and kids alike can appreciate.Kit Tyler has lived a free and luxurious life in Barbados, with her kindly grandfather. When he dies, however, she finds herself essentially penniless and forced to head to New England to live with her aunt and her family. But Connecticut is very different from the sunny island the \\"tropical bird\\" left behind: Bleak, muddy, dreary, and filled with grim Puritans -- including her relatives. Her stern uncle disapproves of Kit's upbringing, her love of books, her flamboyant clothing, and her lack of experience in housework.Kit tries to fit in with the proud, beautiful Judith and quiet crippled Mercy, but she isn't a Puritan and it shows. Her only friend is the sardonic sailer Nat, who alternately irritates and interests her. Then Kit encounters Hannah, a sweet old Quaker woman who lives as an outcast because of her religious beliefs. When rumors of witchcraft start flying, Kit must try to save first Hannah -- and then herself -- from the witch hunters.Without actually time-travelling, nobody can know what it would be like to live among the Puritans. But Speare gives us an approximation -- Kit is smart, witty, tolerant, adventurous and serves as a doormat for no one. She's much closer to a modern teenage girl than to the Puritans, and so her conflicts with her unyielding uncle are very illustrative. Among these are the dislike of non-religious reading, insistence on continuous hard work with only a few interludes of fun, and one memorable scene where Kit tries to give her cousins some of her beautiful clothes -- only to have her uncle explode when he sees them. We also see some demonstrations of how often religious intolerance blinded these people to a person's true nature, giving them a scapegoat for their fear of the unknown. However, it is stressed that while the Puritans were intolerant and rigid, individuals were good underneath it -- such as when Kit's uncle defends her against the witch-hunters.There's a little romance in this book, including a love pentagon worthy of Shakespeare (fortunately matters sort themselves out), and this is one area where Speare stumbles. The love tangles seem a little too contrived. However, she includes a fair number of details on life in New England at that time, but never becomes too engrossed in them that she loses track of the plot. The pace is fairly slow until the witch trials; younger kids may be bored by this, but older ones will not mind so much.Kit is a great heroine -- flawed but always sympathetic, funny and strong, brave and intelligent. Fortunately Speare never falls into the trap of simply transporting a modern girl back in time. Judith, Nat and Hannah are also great supporting characters: Nat is great as the sarcastic but supportive love interest. Hannah is a sweet old woman who is content to live a simple life. And Judith will earn both irritation and liking for her pride and determination. Characters like Mercy and the aunt and uncle are a little less three-dimensional; Mercy never rises from the cliche of the gentle, sweet disabled girl, and the aunt and uncle are a doormat and a tyrant most of the time, although the uncle does rise up with some good moments. Extra love interests William and John are also pretty flat: William is a bit like a brainless puppy panting at Kit's feet, and John is a humorless Biblical scholar. The little girl Prudence and her hideous mother are very good, however, and provide the book with a villain and a young friend for Kit.Don't be put off by the title of \\"Witch\\"--this is an insightful, well-written historical novel with an excellent heroine and a tense storyline. One of the few books that deserved its Newbery."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"When Kit Tyler boarded the Dolphin, a ship that would take her from Barbados to New England, she had no idea what lay in store for her.

I have read it so many times I have lost count and yet it still remains, and always will, one of my all-time favourites. It provides a perfect mix of history, romance, drama and suspense and will keep the reader hooked throughout. The characters of Nat and Kit are brilliantly written, as their initial reserve deepens to friendship and finally something more. When reading this book I was torn between wanting it to last forever and desperation to discover how the story would finish.

It is probably one of my favorite historical fiction books. It takes you on a wild ride through 17th century New England. A girl from the tropics spends a year in a colonial puritan town. She is accused of witchcraft, because she associated with an old Quaker woman. Will she convince the judges or will what happened to 19 women and 1 man in Salem happen to her? I particularly liked how the main character, Kit, meets the Quaker woman in the meadow after a confrontation with her uncle, Matthew. At first, she's afraid because she's heard rumors about the Quaker woman being a witch. They become fast friends and together they teach another girl, whose mother thinks she is completely stupid.

I love everything about it. It is a mixture of bravery, homesickness, and love. Kit Tyler makes the journey from Barbados to Wethersfield because her Grandfather died.

When she makes a huge mistake in teaching a dame school, she seeks help in the meadow with the accused witch, Hannah Tupper. She befriends both Hannah and Prudence, an abused child. She teaches this overworked child to read, learn, and love. She falls in love with Nat Eaton, the captain's son. She is accused of being a witch and put to trial. These words can barely describe the brilliance and excitement of this novel, and I will never grow too old to read it!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Book The Witch of Blackbird Pond written by Elizabeth Speare is a wonderful novel. It teaches kids about the lifestyle of the colonisaal people and how one girl survives a major change of lifestyles, from the higher class life to a lower class. Also, I think the book reflects love, friendship, and courage. The book is about a young girl from Barbadoes, Kit, who moves in with her Aunt Rachel and Uncle Mathew in Conneticut. She has to adjust to changes and the lifestyle they live in Conneticut such as working around the house instead of servants doing all the work. Kit meets an old women named Hannah. Her and Hannah grow a strong realationship together, but one thing could break them apart. The town that the two ladies were living in thought Hannah was a witch! Kit was accused also of being a witch because she hung out with Hannah. Kit was sent to trial for this so called &quot;crime&quot; . She was locked up and only hoping that someone would come and save her. Maybe William would come and save her, Maybe Prudence,the girl she had helped to learn how to read and how to write, or nat, maybe even Aunt Rachel. Read the novel to find out what happens. I think this book reflects friendship because Hannah was a great friend to Kit. She was always there when Kit needed comforting of just when she needed to talk. It also reflects friendship when Kit and Prudence became good friends. Kit helped Prudence to learn how to read and how to write. They too where there for eachother when they needed a shoulder to cry on. This book also reflects courage. Kit had to stand up for herself in many places. For example, Kit had to stand up for herself at the witch trials. She had to convince them that she really wasn't a witch. SH ehad to be couragous also when she went to her Aunt Rachels and her Uncle Mathew's house. She had to expect that they would let her in and she couldn't back out after she had gotten on the boat.

This book has enough romance to make it unappealing to some, but it deserves the Newbery Award it won in 1959.Kit Tyler was orphaned years before, but it is only now that she feels like an orphan - her grandfather, Sir Francis Tyler, a well-off plantation owner on Barbados, has died and Kit finds out that all he's left behind is mountainous debt. His entire estate is sold off to pay those debts and Kit's own slave has to be sold, as well, to finance her journey to Connecticut. There, her mother's only sister, beautiful Rachel, lives with her family. She befriends Nat Eaton, the captain's son, but fails to tell him that her family isn't expecting her. He is surprised by their surprise, when Kit shows up on their doorstep, where they part ways. Kit, too, gets a surprise, when she finds that her aunt, once a great beauty, is a somewhat worn, plain woman. Clearly her life has changed her.It takes some time for Kit to get accustomed to the ways of her aunt's family, who are Puritans (Kit had even disparagingly referred to them as \\"Roundheads\\" while still on the boat). Their simple life of hard work is a harsh existence with little joy and Kit misses much about her old life. Still, she has no one else and tries to learn to do the chores she is given to the best of her ability. When William Ashby, a young man of some means, begins to court her, Kit realizes that he might be the best chance she has to escape from the drudgery of her life under Uncle Matthew's roof. Judith, Kit's cousin, had previously set her sights on William, but when he favors Kit, she turns her attention to John Holbrook, a budding clergyman. Judith is unaware that her crippled sister, Mercy, has fallen in love with John and even less aware that John also loves Mercy.While the prospect of escape via marriage to William is in the future, Kit lives in the present, becoming friendly with Hannah, an elderly Quaker woman who lives alone on the shore of Blackbird Pond. The townspeople believe her to be a witch, mostly because she isn't Puritan. Consorting with Hannah doesn't do much to improve Kit's standing in the town, but she laughs off the idea of herself or anyone being a witch - until they lock her up and put her on trial. Her friendships with Nat and Prudence pay off in a big way, when they appear at the trial, but Nat runs before she can thank him - and before she realizes that it is Nat that she really loves.As a teen or pre-teen, this book would not have impressed me much, and I'd have found the romance gag-worthy. Everyone ends up with the guy they should end up with and all, it is implied, live happily ever after. As an adult, however, I really enjoyed the story. The prejudice of the time, not unlike the prejudice of ANY time period, was interesting. To read that the ability to swim was an indication that one was a witch is funny now, but a nice bit of irony for the time - the only way to prove your innocence was to die by drowning! Not perfect, and a little more \\"historical romance\\" than plain old \\"historical fiction\\", but still very nicely done.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This captivating story of a girl who is forced to move from her warm Carribean home to the bleak, cold town of Wethersfield, is an excellent novel for young readers who like to read historical fiction books.

It was about a girl who travels to America to find family to live with since her family died. She ends up finding them and they are taken by surprise by some things she can and can not do. As well as thing she posses like, beautiful dresses and money. She needs to help on their farm but is not used to that so she runs off only to find a little house in a meadow of flowers about a mile away from where she lives now and the lady walks up to her, the one from the little house. She returns home and they become pals but many believe that she is a witch. What happens in the end, read the book to find out.I loved the book! It is probably a ten (10) and older book, and a book for adults too. It is an exciting book because who knows what a response or action will be next. I would rate The Witch of Black Bird Pond a five star (*****) book for its simply wonderful story. It's a book I would recommend but mostly for girls who love a bit of romance but mostly adventure."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Sixteen year old Kit Tyler, has spent most of her life with her wealthy grandfather on his plantation on the sunny island of Barbados. She is treated like royalty and is richer than rich. Then, Kit's grandfather falls ill and dies, so Kit is forced to go live with the only family she has left, her Aunt Rachel and Uncle Matthew. Kit boards a ship on its way to her aunt and uncle in Connecticut and meets a number of people. A child named Prudence loses her doll in the water and while she is reaching after it, she falls in. Kit leaps in after her without a second thought, and brings her safely back to the boat. The people on the boat were not familiar with women swimming and therefore thought she was a witch. Pretty soon word spreads and half of the town suspects Kit of being a witch. Kit befriends an old Quaker woman in the forest named Hannah Tupper who is thought as a witch herself. Kit must fight to make everyone believe they are not witches before they lose their lives. Overall, The Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very well-written and entertaining book.One reason why this book was interesting was because of the main character, Kit Tyler. She was feisty, outspoken, and she stood up for what she believed in without a care of what anyone else thought. For example, the town thought her bright colored dresses were a sign of rebellion and her uncle warned her to stop wearing them, but she wore them anyway. Kit also befriended a woman named Hannah Tupper who not only was called a witch, but she was a Quaker as well. At the end of the story Kit married a man named Nat, who was a sailor and apparently \\"not good enough for her.\\"Another reason why this book was entertaining was the unintended humor. Something in this story that was really funny were the reasons the town accused Kit of being a witch. They thought she was a witch because she could swim, because of what she wore, and because of the things she said and did. There was a particular event in the story where Kit is teaching Prudence to read and write herself because Prudence's parents don't think Prudence is smart enough to be taught at a real school. Kit tells Prudence to continue writing her name over and over again in a book. Someone from the village finds this book and thinks Kit is trying to put a spell on Prudence because they think Kit is writing Prudence's name over and over again. Of course, Prudence defends Kit, but the people from the town think she is only protecting her because she is bewitched. Throughout the story similar events happen and they make even less sense.This book was also enjoyable because of the ending. Even though Kit's older nice cousin Mercy, dies, the story ended well. Nat, who Kit met through her friend Hannah, is a sailor and the son of the owner of the boat Kit arrived on. In the end of the story, Kit and Nat get married and Nat gets his own ship. As a joke because of all the events that happened during the story, Nat names his ship The Witch, and promises Kit he will take her anywhere. Hannah also accompanies them both on the ship. Kit's formerly grumpy uncle becomes nicer and more open since he lost his daughter, Mercy.The final reason this book was a good read was because of the variety of characters. The group of friends in this story are unique and unlikely to meet. The very unlikely group of friends in this story are Kit, Nat, Prudence, and Hannah. Kit is a rich and spoiled girl who is surprisingly nice. Nat is a normal sailor with a kind heart. Prudence is a little girl whose mother abuses her and thinks she is very stupid. Hannah is an odd old lady that lives in a small hut out in an abandoned meadow in the middle of a field with a black cat. Hannah Tupper is the person that really brought them all together. Even though these characters have some similar issues it seems odd that they became friends because they are from opposite worlds. All in all, this was a very good book and is good to read if you want to learn about the colony religions and also want to read a good book.S.Brown"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"A year ago, for schoolwork I had a choice to read this book, and I took it.

I think the witch in the book means a person daring to create good thing but contrasts with others as Kit Tyler and her friends. It's a reason why they were accused to be the witches. Like Kit said \\" people are afraid of things they don't understand\\" this idea has existed in the real world since people always prejudge others because of differ. The witch is the good symbol of this matter. I also one phased of Hannah \\" There is no escape if love is not there\\" it's true that people can't run away from love.

I read this book many years ago, and decided to purchase it, since I found it enjoyable."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I'll begin by saying that I wasn't entirely convinced that I was going to like this book when I first started reading it. In fact, I was downright sure that I wasn't going to be able to relate to the main character anymore than I could relate to the sea worthy Dolphin. I was also sure that the storyline was going to be drab and moralistic because it was published in '58.I was very pleasantly surprised however when I found myself eagerly turning pages after the first few chapters. Despite the slow start I was very much enthralled by the storyline and put on perpetual edge by the constant predicaments of the main character, Kit.There were some very dry parts of the book that I'm surprised I made it through, but then there were those one or two moments when I was actually drawing up on the couch in suspense thinking to myself \\"If what I think is going to happen happens I'll pass out!\\"Towards the end I was even starting to tear up in frustration due to the unfairness in which the main character is treated by the townspeople.That's how emotional I can get over books, people. It's pretty absurd.The biggest surprise came when I realized near the end of the book that I could relate to this 16 year old royalist girl rather well. In fact... I found that I could completely understand her situation as a spunky foreigner in the midst of a very plain and strict group of strangers.At first I was very keen on despising the puritan characters that surrounded Kit, choosing to focus very much on the fact that Kit seemed constantly oppressed by the drab, colorless culture.After putting the book down, however, I began to realize that there was no \\"This is better than that\\" or \\"that is better than this\\". In fact it came very much down to \\"To each-his own\\". At first when I believed that the author was attempting to cast the puritan lifestyle of Kit's family in a negative light I couldn't help but clamor on about how unfortunate the main character was to be in her situation.However, I began to theorize that the author was very cleverly pointing out to the reader their own judgmental attitude. Just as with Kit, the reader goes from being completely appalled at the main character's surroundings and then slowly they come to realize there's strength and beauty in it (even if it's not the favorite of the reader).Anyway, I could really go on about it all day, but I'll end the review by telling you all that I was pleasantly surprised by the captivating story of a young woman discovering new perspectives and finding new ways to know herself and others."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of black bird pond was a very interesting, yet excelent book. Many times in this book it got very intence. An example is when the towns people went to go find Hannah to burn the house down becuase they believed she was a witch. I like books when they get exciting. This gives you the thrill of wanting to read more to find out what happens next. This book also was not only a good book, but told you about how hard life was in the colonial times. Next to all these things, this book created alot of suspence. At the begining of the book, Kit jumped into the water. It was suspenceful because it never told you if she could swim or not. It made you believe that there was a chance that she could drown. This book gave you a very good idea of what it was like for a young girl to move to a whole new land where everything is different. I think it really helped young readers better understand how it was back then. I know it helped me! I think everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I found that The Witch of Blackbird pond by Elizabeth Spere was a very interesting story. In my opinion Spere did a great job at really letting the reader know what it was like to live in the 1700's. She made it seem so real by talking so descriptively of all the customs and the way of doing things in that time period. Spere clearly had to do a lot of research to know so much of that time. If someone is interested in learning about American history this book would be a great choice. I also found this book to be very exciting. There were so many times that you were left thinking did that just really happen. I think the story was so exciting because of how descriptive Spere was. She left you amazed in what she made some of her characters do and think. I would reccomend this book anyone, even if your not interested in American history because the novel is so exciting. Atleast in my case it left me wanting to know more about the 1700's even thow i had no interest in it before."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The book, Witch Of Blackbird Pond, was actually pretty good. The authorr kept you thinking about, who would marry who at the end, and what's going to happen to Hannah the &quot;witch.&quot; The book is also very suspensful. It leaves out important parts until later on in the book. For instance, when Kit was being put on trial for witch craft, you didn't know that Nat would be involved beczuse the author made you believe that he left with the ship.The book was also a little frustrating. I think it was because, you obvisiouly knew that Mercy and John were inlove and yet, the author made you believe that John would be to shy or intimidated to speak up and admit to Judith that he was inlove with Mercy and not her. You also knew that William and Judith were made for eachother because the author made Judith really seem to want to live in a big house with lots of money, and thats what William did. The author actually did a good job there beczuse it made the book not be boring and long winded, because she made you think about a lot of what was going on. She did very good at making the book suspensful. I hopee you decide to read this book because i enjoyed it and it takes a lot for a book to keep me reading and not get bored:0)"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I think that &quot;The Witch of blackbird Pond&quot; was a great book to read.The characters were very realistic.Kit was a rich and stuck-up girl who changed after she was in Weathersfeild for a while.I dont really think that she was a witch because she didn't put spells on people, wear all black or anything like that. I think that Mattew Wood was a very mean man and I think that Kit felt the same way, until he stood up for her when she was on trial.To me Judith didn't like the idea of Kit coming to live in Weathersfeild because she would lose attention, after a while she seemed to become nicer.Rachel and Mercy were alike to me because they both like the idea of Kit coming to live with them. On the other hand I wouldn't read the book for a couple or reasons. One is because everything happened to slowly, which made the story a little boring.Another reason why I didn't like the book is because some of the events were hard for me picture of in my head.Pictures would of helped a lot.Lastly,I didn't like this book because it was on a topic that didn't me, expecialy because I already read it once."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Spears was a suspenseful and enjoyable novel. I can only imagine how Kit felt coming from Barbados where she had a lot of freedom, to Connecticut where she faced hard work everyday. Through Kit's journey, I learned about how it might have been to grow up in colonial times. I also learned about what it means to be a true friend. Kit was not afraid to get to know Hannah Tupper even though all of the townspeople disliked her. The novel includes many different relationships between all of its characters. I wanted to keep reading to find out how all of their friendships would grow and change throughout the story. I was surprised to see how the relationships ended up. The only thing that I did not like about the novel was that it seemed to start out slow. I had a hard time getting interested at first. Fortunately, the story did pick up and I enjoyed the rest of the novel. I think that anyone who reads this novel will learn a lot and enjoy the story at the same time."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Overall I think that the author did a good job on the book \\" The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\". I thought this for many reasons. First of all the characters were realistic and they made it seem like it was back in the olden days. For example Kits uncle was furious when he saw his daughters in Kits fancy dresses and he said that they didn't need that stuff. But today almost anyone would be glad to get nice new clothes. Another reason I liked this book was because it was suspenseful. It was very suspenseful when the townspeople were going 2 Hannah's house with the torches because you didn't know if Hannah would be alright or not. Another suspenseful part was in the courtroom scene because you aren't sure whether kit will accused of witchcraft or not. For these reasons I enjoyed the book \\" The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\"."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I think this was an interesting story but could have been better. One thing I liked was how you could feel how Kit felt in coming to a new land. When she was showing the dresses off to Mercy and Judith, Matthew got really mad and Kit was probably confused. You could feel what it would be like in that situation. Also making the story in her point of view was a great idea because then people would know how she was not a witch and sometimes feel how she is feeling. They would think the people weren't thinking correctly, but if it were from another view, like Goodwife's, it would just tell how she is a witch and not how she isn't. Something they could do is to make Kit more adventurous, like if she went on the boat to escape with Nat, people might go after her and she wouldn't be at the trial to see if she's a witch. I think Kit is a little boring, and she always seems to follow the rules, at least most of the time. Also I wonder what would happen if she went back to Barbados and maybe Kit would be more confident after she went back after all this. That is why I think Kit is sort of a boring person and she could use some personality."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Oct.20, 2000The Witch of Blackbird PondI found the book by Elizabeth George Speare interesting and entertaining. I really think she did a good job on many aspects of the book. First off, I think she did a good job on the attitudes of the people in the book. She made the characters and made them their own, unique personality. And even though in the beginning you think all the towns' people are the same, in the end (and especially at the trial for Kit), you see that they are all different. She followed each of them throughout the book and always had a reason for their actions. For example, when Kit was sitting in the barn waiting for William to come, and William never did, she had William explain why he never did. That definitely stressed his character and entertained the reader. Also when Hannah put her foot down and wouldn't go with Nat on the ship until she had her cat, it made the reader think: is this Hannah in this kind of situation? And the answer is yes; because her cat was the only thing she had left, since they burned down her house and her husband's dead. That also brings out Nats' character and shows that he really cares about Hannah. That's why I think that Elizabeth George Speare really succeeded on the characters of the book. One thing I think that the author did not accomplish well is the priorities in the book. By the title and the first couple of chapters, you'd think that the whole book is going to be about witches, but it's not and in that way, it can be very misleading. Maybe she meant to do that, but the book isn't really about witches until the very end again. In the middle of the book, it's just focusing, on her life with Aunt Rachel and family. Also, Hannah is mentioned to be a witch, but a big deal is not really made out of it. They just mention it as the reason why nobody really likes her. That is something that I disagree with the author on the book, The Witch of Blackbird Pond."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I think the character, Mathew Wood, which Spear created was the most believable in the entire book. He was the one character in &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; that, when Kit came unexpectedly, was not the least bit pleased, nor was he ashamed to express it. I think that Spear did a tremendous job showing Mathew's personality and true character. One of the events which I thought best represented Mathew was in the beginning of the book, he looked Kit right in the eye and &quot;Laid down the laws&quot; about her wearing such horrendous clothing. On the other hand, there were a couple of events which changed my perspective on Mathew Woods' character. One includes, when Mathew decided not to go on the witch hunt. I thought thought that it was an interesting change of events. Over all, if I were to rate the character of Mathew Wood on a scale from 1-10 I would give him an 8. There were many moods which created &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot;. My favorite of all of the moods through out the book had to be the intensity. If you think back to the book, you will recall many, very intense moments. One of them includes, when Kit was on trial for being a witch, which had to have been my personal favorite. I hear my heart beating while reading that part. Another very intense moment was when the witch hunt was going on. My eyes were glued to the pages during the section of the book. I think that the way Spear creates the mood in this story best represents her a writer. I would give the mood of the story a 10 if I were to rate it on a scale from 1-10."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"There were many good aspects to the story. One good aspect is the setting of Blackbird Pond because that type of setting seems to be a good place for a witch to live in. Another good aspect to the story is the characters, because each one has his or her own special ability and personality. Good aspect is the date and century it took place because witches were mostly feared at that time.There were also many bad aspects to the story. One bad aspect is that the author was telling more about Kit's adaptation to her new home instead of telling more about the whole point of the story, which is the witch. Another bad aspect to the story is that there were just too many conflicts in the story. Another bad aspect to the story is that the mood is mostly depresing because of Kit's hard time adapting to her new home. In conclusion, those are the good and bad aspects to the story."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read this in high school and loved it.

She was an out-going young rebellion. Some others in the story were Mercy, Judith, Mathew Wood, Aunt Rachel, and Hannah. Mercy and Judith were quiet most of the time but at times they would become a little more out-going than usual. Mathew Wood was a tall stern man who had fury. Aunt Rachel was a quiet woman but she would and could out break at times. Hannah was the \\"suspected witch and was a kind and a very lonely Quaker.Even before she set foot on the dull and forbidding shore of Wethersfield, Conneticut, on that April day in 1687. Kit Tyler felt the finger of suspension pointing at her. A solid cloud of disapproval settled about her as dis heartning as the contrast of this gray, barren land to the shimmering green that hinged the turquoise bay of Barbados which had been her home for sixteen years.Her unconventional upbringing and her luxorious wardrobe were out of place in the primative household of her aunt's family and so were her clumsy ettorta at cleaning and scrubbing.

Then she is introduced to a man named William Ashby who starts to like Kit very fast. They became acquainted and he then started coming to the house every Saturday where he announced that he was going to start building a house of his own.

And at the very end, two weddings were announced, John Holbrook and Mercy Wood & William Ashby and Judith Wood.I like this book because all of the characters had something interesting about all of them.

Coming from a wealthy life in Barbados, Kit has many things she is unaccustomed to. Along with facing many hardships of earning her keep because her new family isn't prosperous at all, as well as her daily chores and tasks, she manages to make many friends along the way. Hannah, a wise old widow accused of being a witch, Prudence, a young neglected girl, and John Hollonbrook, of which Kit becomes very fond of. Poor Kit couldn't have come to the new world at a worse of time however, due to the conflicts with the king in Europe and war breaking loose. The witch trials were also coming to a spark. Poor Hannah is accused of being a witch for she does not follow the traditions as everyone else in the town. However, Kit stays by her side through it all. Family matters become horrid as well when the whole family becomes fatally ill. Will the countries problems become solved? Will Hannah be executed for what she is believed to be? Will Kit's new family die of sickness? How does Kit affect the future of all these people? In a story of excitement and sadness, Kit becomes a woman and learns what she must do to make the right choices.*Likes*I enjoyed the book \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" for the most part. I enjoyed the character descriptions very much because the way they described what the characters were wearing and there setting was very lucid but fluently stated. For example when in the book it stated, \\"...The dolphin left the open sea, sailed briskly across the sound to the wide mouth of the Connecticut River...\\" (p. 1) I also enjoyed how so much history was based upon this book. It was a way for me to understand the colonial times better and really understand what life was like back then. For example, it really involved major milestones in history, which made it easier to understand. My last favorite thing about this book was the major twists and turns it took. Some of the major events you would have never expected. All and all the book was very enjoyable.*Dislikes*The dislikes I had about \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" were slim, however there were a few. The main thing I didn't enjoy about the book was although the descriptions were very thorough I just thought at some points of the book, they were too histrionic and went overboard. For an example when Kit is lying in a nearby field, it describes the field in a manor so much that I lost interest. Another thing I did not enjoy was the book was a bit childish for my age. This is my fault for choosing he book but I still thought that for me I could have read a more enthralling book. Lastly, I did not enjoy how many characters were placed in the book. Throughout the book so many characters with similar names were introduced. It became overwhelming at a point because I was confusing some characters. However the book was enjoyable at most parts but if I could revise the book, I would say these things based on my judgment.*Conclusion*In conclusion to this review, I would definitely recommend thins book to younger readers from the ages 9 - 12. However I being 13 I did not enjoy the book as much as I think a younger person might. I did enjoy the book but do not recommend it to anyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I think this book was odd.

Some were even creative and said that it is a spellbinding novel of suspense and romance. Most said it is a well written and that they enjoyed the way she formed her characters. In my opinion though, all of these book critics have been embellishing the facts.I agree that it was a well written but nothing so outstanding, so intriguing that I would recommend this book for joy reading. It is hard to believe that over 200,000 hard copies alone have been sold. The plot was very typical, because even sheep could guess what the out come would be in almost all the events. How could the wooly animals do this and there be an ounce of suspense with in the cover of Speare's book.One critic even went as far as to say that the novel was compelling. I wonder if the person making that statement knew that compelling meant: tending to demand attention, how could a book that someone might choose to read to put them to sleep be compelling.Although, this is just my opinion of Speare's book. You might find the book to be as the book critics have said. The book may really be compelling, outstanding, and suspenseful. But if I were you I wouldn't take such a risky chance. A chance that after spending several hours reading the book that you realize that you agree with my opinion.

I have only read it once in a couple of weeks and was surprised at how colonial it was. Everything in the story is 1700 colonial like, including the type of works they did, the stocks, the type of clothes, calling instead of dating, the types of food, etc. I could go on and on. Speare must have done lots of research to make her story so genuine. Although, it is sort of old (seeing as though my mom read it in 3rd grade), it seems she wrote it 300 years ago, not 50. The descriptions of everything make you feel you are really in Wethersfield, Conn. She also wrote about the witch superstitions, like wearing odd clothes, being able to swim, and reading and acting out plays. When I first read the cover title, I thought the book was going to be about witches. Although there is a small witch trial in the back of the book, it is basically about Kit's life in Connecticut, in colonial times. I was a little disappointed about the fact that the book was not about witches. I read the book because I was interested in witches, not in colonial life.

The general public at this time and place thought of witchcraft as the devil's art and burned witches (or anybody they thought was a witch) at the stake. These were unjust times for many accused of being a witch. I thought Ms. Speare did a great job of portraying feelings and the time and era in which the story takes place. The story runs smoothly from event to event and the details in the story help you get a sense of what's happening. The author includes many concrete descriptions and gives you a very vivid idea of what's going on. The best part about this book was it was actually exciting and you never knew the entire truth till the very end.... Historical fiction is a fiction story but it is based on an event that actually happened in history. This book meets the standards of historical fiction because in the 1750's (the time in which the book takes place) the scenarios with the characters are what it was like. For example when a male wanted to marry a girl he would \\"call\\" on her and on certain evenings he would come over and talk with her. He would also make a house for both of them to live in. Both these things happen in the book and lots of other things. This book was a great book and had great detail! It is at children's reading level but is a great book for all ages because of the great literature in it."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The book The Witch of Blackbird Pond was about the problems ayoung girl named Katherine faced early on when her parents passedaway. Which then forced her to have to go and live with hergrandfather who was very rich. Soon after she went to live with hergrandfather he to passed away, which left her with no one to livewith. Her grandfather owed a debt to a man that he never paid,Katherine didn't have hardly enough money to pay him with so the manasked her to marry him but she said no. Then Katherine decided totravel to her aunt and uncle's house to live with them for awhile. Katherine traveled by boat to their house on the Dolphin.While Katherine was on board, a young girl's doll dropped into thewater and Katherine went and jumped into the water to get the dollsince the young girl's mother wouldn't. In this time there was aroutine that was followed by young woman and women. This was, theywere thrown into the water and then if they sank they weren't a witch,but if they floated they were a witch. So while Katherine was in thewater trying to receive the doll, a young by the name of Nate jumpedin to make Katherine sink so that everyone thought that she was awitch. Once Katherine had arrived at her aunt and uncle's house, shewas told to stay away from a lady who lived near the pond and everyonethought that she was a witch. So then Katherine became curious to thelady that lived near the pond and decided that she would go and visither. Someone found out that Katherine went to visit the lady and wentto tell her uncle. Katherine then got kicked out by her aunt and uncleand went to live with the women that she met on the ship, with thedaughter's doll that fell in the water.

In which they then burned the lady'shouse down. The lady escaped with her cat's Dan went to hide. Ithought that this book was a life learning way to respect your familyand enjoy life.

It is exciting while it also gives you true historical information. The book truly deserves the Newbery Honor Award. It covers many different subjects, including love. The characters had personalities all their own. There was an amusing variety of personality. You go from soft-spoken John Holbrook to strictly puritan Matthew Wood to very vocal Gershom Bulkeley. This book was great!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The book that I was reading is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond. This book is by Elizabeth George Spearce. This book was amazing because the main character, which was Kit, expressed herself in a way no other characters express themselves.In this book the main character is Kit, she is accused of being a witch. It all started on the ship the \\"Dolphin\\" because a little girl drops her doll in the ocean and Kit jumps after it to save it. Supposedly if you can swim that means that you're a witch, a \\"regular\\" girl would just sink. Kit denies it and says that her grandfather taught her.There were some things I didn't like and some I did about the book. I liked the book because this reminded me of the Salem Witch Trails. I also liked this book because the book had many interesting settings. My last reason is because I liked the way Kit expressed herself towards the people around her. What I didn't like is that it didn't talk a lot about the title. Also I didn't like the way that she didn't talk about the other characters.There were many settings in this book. The first setting was the \\"Dolphin\\" which is the ship Kit boardes on. The second setting is Connecticut. The third is mostly where the story took place after Kit got off the Dolphin, which is her Aunt's house. Lastly, Blackbird Pond is another setting. This book was historical fiction."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Can you believe the great book I have just finished? The great book I just finished reading is titled The Witch Of Blackbird Pond. The great writer that wrote this book is Elizabeth George Speare. The genre is Historical Fiction. This book takes place in Connecticut, in Blackbird pond, at Kit's aunt's house, and the \\"Dolphin.\\"This book is about a girl and he name is Kit and she used to live with her grandfather, but he died. Then before her grandfather died a guy wanted to marry Kit but she didn't want to. So she went aboard the \\"Dolphin\\" (a ship) and a little girl dropped he doll. So kit went to get it in the water and she knew how to swim. But when she came back she came back she was in a little bit of trouble because she was accused of being a witch, because \\"regular\\" girls would drown. Then she went to her aunt's house and they had a school in the summer, and Kit's cousin Mercy is the teacher.

In the end everything turns out all right for everyone because the two cousins found the perfect guy to marry and Kit finds freedom. So Mercy marries John Holbrook and Kit's other cousin Judith marries William Ashby.I liked the book because the book was interesting like when they went to the pond and she met the witch. I also liked the book because they had little kids and I like little kids and I like little kids and because it talks about the problems that she went through to get accustomed to the new way of living. Another reason is that I liked it was that it took place in many different places not just in one place.

I'm 22 and I recommend it to readers of all ages; especially pre-teen and teen age girls because it doesn't talk down to young readers at all.The main character: a 17yr. old girl from Barbados named Katherine is a strong, determined young woman worthy of admiration. The story wasn't cheeky or overly fictious. That was it's charm. It was down to earth and prosed so that the story came to you and you didn't have to go to it.

As she lives her life through the Puritan ways and goes through good and bad times she learns about her new family with her aunt, uncle, and her two cousins. I would give this book five stars for the author makes her readers a path through history that takes us through hardship, witch trials, and romance.

But remember, thee has never escaped at all if love is not there.&quot;"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I think that the author didn't do a good job with helping Kitlearn more about slaves. I think this because in the beginning of thebook the author mentioned a few things about slaves. For example shesaid that in Wheathersfield they had to do work unlike in Barbadoeswhere they had slaves there. Also I think that Kit should have learnedsome more information about slaves such as the pain they went through,their daily life, why they were such a big part in people's lives. Idon't think that Kit really had a good understanding of slaves sincethere was not much information in the novel. This Is why I think theauthor didn't do that great of a job with explaining more about slavesto Kit.I think that throughout the novel Kit went through a lot ofchanges. One major change Kit experienced was when she arrived inWeathersfield she realized that there were no slaves there and she hadto work quite hard. Another change occured when she met Hannah, shestarted to belive and practice witchcraft. Also Kit thought a littlebit more about boys than when she lived in Barbadoes. I think that KItbecame more responsible because she was able to handle working andteaching kids. Also she was caring. For instance when she helpedHannah fix her roof and when she taught some kids how to write andread. These are a few changes that Kit experienced."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"&quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; is one of my favorite books. I've read it four times! The strong heroine,struggling with the injustice and prejudice of the Puritan colony in Coneticut is interesting and exciting. The charcters are vivid and interesting, showing different ideas and personalitis. I love Katherine, the hero of the book, her love for books, sailing and the outdoors; her lively spirit.I like her family-the strong uncle, the caring aunt, and especialy the two cousins, Mercy-kind and unselfish,and Judith-happy and beautiful. Out of the family are Nat-a sailor,lively,mocking and careing. John,studing to be a minister,quiet, thoughtful. Hanna-the &quot;witch&quot;.A old and kind woman,living by her self with her cat.

Kit's journey from the warm Caribbean to the coldPuritan valley in Connecticut has been read again and again, and will likely be read for decades to come. A charming romance of an outsider trying to fit into a new and strange culture, the novel immediately brings the reader a sense of what it is like to try and fit into a world very different from the one you grew up in. My only complaints about the novel are minor: the picture of the Puritans is far too cold, given what we now understand about the Puritans (although their persecution of the Quakers is dead on in the novel), and the ending seems a little too pat and contrived (I won't tell you, other than to say that everybody ends up with somebody they deserve).

One day she went there with her friend Nat to help fix Hannah's roof, and when she got home, her uncle Matthew got mad at her.

There were parts in the book than were kind of slow and drug on. I would give this book two stars. Some of the parts that should have been long were very short and not enthralling. One example of this would be the witch trials. I thought that would be thrilling and exciting, but instead it was was short and down to the point. If it would have been more gripping, it would have got a better rate. I didn't like how this book bounced from one spot to another. In some some places you got lost. I didn't like the beginning because it didn't draw me in or keep my attention. She didn't give me much of a physical description of the characters or the setting. The plot was unclear and had many different problems, so it was hard to keep straight what was happening.

I think that if you like romance with a little bit of action in it this is definitely the book for you.Probably one of the reasons that I didn't like it is because it had a witch in it and I don't believe in witches.

The story was actually about how dating worked back in colonial times.The author mentioned that in order to go out with someone that the male had to ask the father's permission in order to call on the female.An example of this would be when an admirer of Kit{William Ashby} asked Kit's uncle if he could call her out.He did this by sucking up to him then asking him his permission.In conclusion, my once again is that this book has nothing to do with witches or witch craft."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read this book when I was in fifth or sixth grade.

Like a tropical bird that has flown to the wrong shore, Kit has trouble fitting in, though she quickly attracts the attention of the entire town with her bright silk dresses, her unusual ability to swim, and her headstrong personality.

She and Uncle Matthew make Kit's new wooden home seem even colder. Her loneliness and misery ultimately leads her to meet and befriend Widow Tupper, the Witch of Blackbird Pond. The days she spends with Widow Tupper and Nat, a sailor whom she met on her journey to Connecticut, are the ones she enjoys most. But her Aunt Rachel tells her to stay away from Widow Tupper because she's a Quaker and the whole town considers her a witch. Kit ignores the warnings and continues to visit her anyway.

Everything from household chores to religious beliefs to politics is covered, but the real beauty of this gem of a book lies in the subtle romance between the title character and a sea captain's son, and in the love that she comes to feel for Hannah, a suspected witch, Prudence, a young, neglected child, and her aunt's family who take her in as one of their own.This book is as pleasurable to read today as it was over 10 years ago.

The Witch of Blackbird Pond describes the life of a pampered but well-meaning young woman forced to live with her aunt's family in a Puritan community. The adjustment is difficult, but she is helped by the village outcast, Hannah, a Quaker who is rumored to be a witch. This book is an inspiring introduction to religious prejudice and early American history; it sparked my interest in those subjects, and doubtless will for other readers. The author has researched well the lives of the Puritans, from wool-carding to church services to theological doctrine. The evolution of Kit into a brave, hard-working woman willing to stand up for her beliefs is a real treat. The supporting characters make the book as much as Kit herself: her stern but upright uncle, the cocky seaman Nat, the fumbling young minister who discovers what he truly stands for, and my favorite, her cousin Mercy, who holds the family together in spite of a physical handicap. The suspense and terror of the witch hunt is very real. This book is ever much more than a simple historical romance!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Kit Tyler's parents died when she was very young, and ever since she has been living with her grandfather in Barbados. When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch.

Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what.

Misunderstood and unloved, she finds solace in the Blackbird Pond that strangely calls to her. Thus begins Kit's journey of friendship, romance and even persecution in the strange new place that was her new home. And through it all, finding ways to stay true to herself.The Witch of Blackbird Pond is an oldie but a goodie... even after all these years, this book is still read by young adults everywhere. Well written and thoroughly entrancing, the story appeals to all ages. The plot contains not only a story of a girl's coming of age, but also the difficult social issues such as prejudice and discrimination. And the history of New England witch hunting, all placed with the backdrop of Connecticut's budding discontentment with the British crown rule. With wonderful characters like Hannah Tupper, Prudence Cruff, Matthew Wood and Nat Eaton, this book is hard to put down! The Witch of Blackbird Pond is still good for me now, as it was in 5th grade."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The 1959 Newbery winner and a very enjoyable book. Kit, or Katherine, raised in then-unconventional, but now more common philosophy of girls being capable and independent-thinking, must establish herself in a new place with more rigid limits for girls and thinking, in this case, a colonial Connecticut town. Like many Newbery-recognized books, this one has a child orphaned. When orphan Kit's grandfather dies in their Barbados home, Kit turns to her aunt and uncle in New England. With colonial politics becoming volatile and weather and Puritan philosophy dicatating a very different lifestyle than she's used to, Kit's good intentions stir up nothing but controversy. Fortunately, they also create some bonds which support her through controversies. Underlying themes of prejudice, witch hunting, slave ownership and class distinction, hard work, and courtship rituals further enhance this pleasant read. A middle school girl would probably enjoy it a lot. I would recommend it to a girl at that age, a strong intermediate grade reader, and maybe even into high school. It would be a valuable read-aloud book to an intermediate grade class working on American history in social studies (fifth grade here)."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Leaving a life from a shimmering Caribbean island to the bleak shores of a Connecticut Colony, Kit Tyler voyages to a new land to begin her new life.

However, Kit is not able to fit in with her new surroundings. She feels as though she \\"is a tropical bird that has flown to the wrong part of the world, a bird that is now caged and lonely.\\" She attempts to find her voice in this new world, but that voice can't seem to break through.

Elizabeth George Speare's Newberry Award Winning Novel.Throughout popular literature, Historical Fiction is either a delight to some or a horror(quite literally) novel to some. Judging from my past experiences, I'd say I would easily fall into the second category, as most become drab and inconsistent mid-way or partially through. When I was assigned to read 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' for Summer Reading, I took the novel on almost as a challenge and a burden at the same time. Anyways, with its 1958 release, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' received heavy critical acclaim, and even received the prestigious John Newberry Award and an ALA Notable Book Award. So, was 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' a surprisingly good novel, or a hopelessly jumbled mix of words? Read on to find out!Plot-16-Year old Katherine Taylor, fondly known as Kit, has left her dreamy Caribbean home for the dreary Puritan life of rural Connecticut. After her beloved Grandfather's death, the only way she could get away from lustful men(of 50!) and debts was to stow away on the 'Dolphin' for a ride to her Aunt's humble abode. Upon her arrival, she clearly doesn't fit in, as she was accustomed to a laid-back lifestyle, yet once the family brings her in, day in and day out, she works still sundown, and by then she's supposed to listen to lengthy preachings on the Bible. Her new frustrating lifestyle slowly eats away at her, and after she's dismissed from her job as a Dame Teacher, she breaks down and flees to the Green Meadows, a secluded patch of beautiful crops and flowers. There a widowed Quaker named Hannah Tupper finds her and consoles her, and the two quickly become fast friends. As the Summer turns into Winter though, the townspeople quickly become ill, and Hannah Tupper and Kit are accused of bringing a plague into town, or inciting Witchcraft. Kit and Hannah must learn to survive among their Puritan neighbors and overcome adversity, while still being friends.Writing/Opinions/Etc.-Unlike the Amazon Review reads, I DO NOT recommend this novel to anyone under 11 or 12, as they may have a tough time getting through this novel. With that out of the way, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', while being Historical Fiction, actually lets the reader imagine a time and a place unlike ours at all, when Satin dresses were considered unorthedox and Jack-O-Laterns \\"of the devil\\". Speare effectively transports the reader back into the lifestyle and the mindset of the Late 1600's, and following Kit through her troubles is actually surprisingly entertaining and enthralling, and I was positively waiting for what would happen next. Speare, unlike fellow \\"classic\\" writers doesn't bog down her writing and plot with lengthy and unneeded descriptions, likewise focusing on the plot yet using colorful language at the same time. On the down side, the plot is incredibly predictable and (at times) repetitive, but I won't take away any points because I felt this was a great novel for Teens.Overall, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' easily bested my expectations for the novel, and I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed a Historical-Fiction novel. Speare is a good writer and storyteller, and I wouldn't mind reading another novel of hers in the future. Of five Summer Reading novels, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' has BY FAR been the best.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF DRAMA AND ADVENTURE. THIS NOVEL IS SUITABLE FOR ANY AGES(EVEN ADULTS!), BUT I RECOMMEND THE READER BE OVER 10 AS THE WRITING MAY CONFUSE THEM OR BORE THEM. HAPPY READING!Also Recommended-Fighting Ground- AVIHarry Potter And the Goblet of Fire- J.K.

She is unprepared for the vast difference between her sumptuous, free life in Barbados and the puritanical economy of Connecticut. From the beginning, she is obviously different-her clothing, her attitudes, her education, politics and religion. She fears she will never fit in, and is not sure she wants to. She befriends Hannah Tupper, against her uncle's wishes, an old woman who lives isolated on Blackbird Pond because she is a Quaker, a reviled religion at the time, and suspected of being a witch. The two isolated, \\"different\\" women create a small community that includes Nat, the son of the captain of the ship that transported Kit to New England, and Prudence, a neglected child Kit teaches to read. After trying unsuccessfully to fit in for months without giving up her own identity, Kit finally manages to become part of her uncle's family when her cousins become ill and she has to take over caring for the sick and all of the household duties. But the illness, which strikes many in the village, causes the suspicious and close-minded villagers to persecute the \\"witch\\" living on Blackbird Pond. Kit risks her own life to save Hannah. Despite her hard work and attempts to fit in, Kit is arrested and stands trial for being a witch.Kit's attempts to fit in while maintaining her independence are a very realistic adolescent experience. Used to a very free lifestyle, Kit does not realize she is doing things that others find shocking or strange. The first time she meets residents of her new home, she jumps into a river to save Prudence's doll. Invigorated by her brief swim, her spirits are dampened by the reactions of the others in the boat. Speare writes, \\"Shock and horror and unmistakable anger stared back at her\\" (9). Her innocent attempt to return a little girl's doll is met with immediate suspicion. Kit has no idea most people in New England cannot swim-she grew up swimming in the warm waters of the Caribbean. Kit's failure to fit in while not even realizing that she is doing things wrong is true to adolescents today, as well as in 1687. Teens feel isolated for so many reasons: they think they don't dress right, or they aren't accepted by the right clique, or they feel smarter or less smart than their classmates.Kit's main internal conflict centers on her desire to be independent while fitting in with the staunch Puritan society. She knows that her family and the villagers would not approve of her friendship with Hannah Tupper, but sneaks away to meet Hannah and Prudence anytime she is free. Kit asks Hannah, \\"What would happen if they found us out?\\" (173). Hannah gives her no answer, she merely states, \\"I know that soon thee would begin to consider that\\" (173). It is up to Kit to reconcile disobeying her family's implied order to stay away from Hannah with her desire to continue her friendship with Hannah, Prudence, and Nat. Kit's conscience wins out-she rescues Hannah from the mob at great risk to herself. She tells her uncle, \\"She's just a poor helpless old woman!\\" before she sneaks out to assist her (184). In helping Hannah, Kit resolves her internal conflict between being accepted and being true to herself. She chooses to be true to herself."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"When I first read the title of this book I thought I new I would never read it. I am not interested in reading anything concerning witches. But I was rong by judging this book by it's cover.It is set in the late sixteen hundreds when Quakers were judged as being witches.Kathrine (the mane character), is a sixteen year old girl who moves from her tropical island home after her Grandfather's death, to New England to live with her Aunt, Uncle and Cousins.One day after having an argument with her Uncle (who did not want her living with them)Kathrine runs to a field and cries. She then meets the mysterious woman everyone claims is a witch. It turns out that the elderly woman, Hannah, is truly a God fearing, loving, kind woman who's husband had died a few years back.Kit befriends Hannah and a little girl who's Mother thinks she is fulish and can't learn anything. Kathrine teaches the girl to read and write.When a deadly sickness comes and kills several children and a few adults the people blame Hannah, saying she has cursed the land, and, having heared that she had been asociating with Hannah, blames Kathrine as well and burns down Hannah's house. Kit then helps Hannah escape with her friend, Nat, on a boat. Kit is caught and stands trial.You must read the book to find out what happens to her.There is no witchcraft or anything of the sort. It is a fun, historical book with, I wouldn't call it romance but a neat friendship between Kathrine and her friend, Nat.So for those of you who,like me,were or are judging this book by it's cover, don't.Though the book is a posative read I still do not like the cover. If Amazon had such a thing for their reviews I would have given it 4&1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is Elizabeth George Speare's (1908-1994) second novel. It won the Newbery Medal with full votes in 1959, one year after its publication. Similarly to her previous \\"Calico Captive\\", Elizabeth George Speare draws her inspiration for this historical novel for young adults from real events. In \\"Calico Captive\\" it was Susanna Johnson's captivity, while in \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" episodes of witch hunting, that had taken place in the Author's hometown of Wethersfiled, Connecticut in 1648 and 1650-51, are the basis for a breathtaking story .It is 1687, year of fighting of the Connecticut colonies to preserve their Charter menaced by the English, when young Kit Tyler, after the death of her grandfather in Barbados, decides to go live with her only relatives in Wethersfiled Connecticut, one of the many settlements on the Connecticut River. At her arrival in her new home she finds a colony of Pilgrims of strict confession which reluctantly accept her as long as she \\"behaves\\" according to their unwavering rules. Her adoptive family is sincere, but mentally and emotionally closed, except maybe for her cousin Mercy, physically handicapped. Slowly Kit adapts to her new environment, but she cannot renounce her true character, her curiosity, her need of culture and spontaneous affection. She befriends a forlorn and neglected child, Prudence and an old and estranged Quaker woman, Hannah Tupper, two outcasts of society, and because of her sincere affection and care is accused of witchcraft. Through hardships and real dangers and the help of true friends she finally finds out who she is and what she wants.Three intermingling love stories make the plot even more captivating and the book is hard to put down once started. All the characters are lifelike and perfectly described and unforgettable, from cousin Mercy (modelled on Elizabeth George Speare's real aunt who was physically disabled), to Nat Eaton, the nicest, most sarcastic and challenging young man encountered in young adult literature, to Prudence the unpromising child who turns out to be Kit's most successful pupil and ultimate saviour.I learned many years after having read the novel in 1967 that this book is today used as a text in English classes in elementary and middle school. Surely it contains many elements to dwell upon and it is hard to forget that Elizabeth George Speare was a teacher particularly dedicated to the study of childhood in the early days of American history. The historical setting of the novel is absolutely perfect with real characters such as Sir Edmond Andros and the royalist Rev. Gersholm Bulkeley that play the role they had in history. The detailed historical research behind the book is also evident from many elements: the pointing out of religious differences, the anti-Quaker bigotry, the psychological explanation based on ignorance of the fear of witchcraft, the difficulty of living in a Pilgrim entourage for a person with sound Faith but educated according to different models.Elizabeth George Speare's knowledge of adolescent problems is evident as well in the way she conveys the sense of feeling a stranger in a different world and in the attempt to fit in while maintaining independence. Another very New Englandish emotion one gets from the book is the beauty of the changing of seasons from the glory of autumn, to the first snow that can be understood only by people who have lived there.After so many years, I ask myself how much influence can a writer have on children. Elizabeth George Speare had an enormous influence on me in particular, but I think she did on many through the development of an instinct of independence and especially of compassion and acceptance. I want to remember that in the acceptance speech for the Newbery Medal for \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" she said.. \\"I do not believe a historical novel should gloss over the pains and the ugliness. But I do believe that the hero .. should on the last page.. still be standing, with the strength to go to whatever the future may hold.\\"Another small notation, the Author makes a recall to the poetry of Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), the first woman poet of American literature, for a long time ignored and forgotten by many and only recently rediscovered in her actuality. Mrs. Speare's citation of her shows us not only her culture and knowledge of early American history but also stimulates the reading of these beautiful poems that immerge us into the atmosphere of \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\"."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Title: The Witch of Blackbird PondAuthor: Elizabeth George SpeareRating: 4.5 StarsI am not going to review this one exactly as I have the others. This I am reviewing as part of the Let's Talk meme from Melissa at iswimforoceans (@melissaswims). This week's topic is underrated books that you have loved. I don't think that the book I am featuring was underrated when it came out, but it's old enough that many young readers may not know about it...and they should!My ReviewI LOVED this book the first time I read it back in 6th grade and I still do (BTW this version of the cover is the one I have). Published in 1958, it was even old then and I found it at a second-hand bookstore. Just to explain how much I loved it, let me offer you this. Many bookophiles love their physical books. Not me, not really. I have become a ebookophile. I LOVE reading ebooks and having them all on my devices. That being said, I USED to haul all my old beloved stories around with me. Until my husband and I moved 8 times in 10 years and then I started to cull the herd. First I got rid of beloved textbooks (yes, I am that much of a nerd). Then I got rid of beloved series' that I just couldn't haul around anymore. I donated them to the library so that another child could benefit from them, but it still hurt. I ended up holding onto a precious few physical books that I just didn't want to let go.The Witch of Blackbird Pond was one of those books.In this story, Kit (Katherine) is a wealthy, carefree girl living in beautiful Barbados in the early days of the British colonies in America. This is pre-revolutionary days. When her father dies, she must leave her island behind and go to live with her closest relatives...a Puritan family in Massachusetts. She is a bit of a wild, undisciplined, and even selfish girl at times. She doesn't think about the big things like money, politics, equality, and spirituality at all. But she's about to enter a world where the curtain will fall on her bright, sunshiny ways.On the boat to her uncle's house, a little girl loses a doll overboard and Kit jumps in to swim to retrieve it for her. When she gets out, nearly the entire ship of passengers and crew are freaked out because ONLY WITCHES CAN SWIM. (Of course, men are allowed to swim, but virtuous women are supposed to sink like a stone.) But Kit grew up in the islands where everyone went swimming. She is a classic \`fish out of water' in this tale. I won't tell you the whole thing, but this is an amazing story of triumph and transformation as Kit learns to appreciate what her new family and life can teach her...and as they learn to question many of their \`values' in light of her open, sunny heart.Nat - Sigh. Nat. He may actually be my first ya \`sigh' of all time. Nat is the son of the ship's captain on the boat that brings Kit to her new home. He is an enigma. Though he is not a true Puritan, he is a true Patriot and is both fascinated and occasionally disgusted by her ways. Over time, they become fast friends as Kit comes to love Hannah, the old Quaker woman whom Nat cares for whenever he can. Of all the people in her new world, Hannah and Nat are the two people who really end up loving and accepting Kit the way she is.Judith and Mercy - Kit's cousins, they are both wonderful in their own way. Judith used to be queen bee in town and is horrified when everyone pays more attention to Kit, including William, who everyone thought would court and marry Judith. Jealousy arises and the girls have to figure their way through it. Mercy. Ah, Mercy. What can I say about her? She is disabled and quiet and contained and lovely. The complete opposite of both Judith and Kit. And it's impossible not to love her. She is her name. In fact, I used to consider naming a daughter Mercy after her, I loved this character soooooo much. Mercy is kind to Kit because Mercy is kind to everyone.When Kit arrives, all the family's plans go haywire as William suddenly wants to court Kit and John Holbrook is somehow arranged into courting Judith. I don't want to spoil the story for you but let's say that things do work out in a way that satisfied me. William is like the male counterpart to Judith. He is attractive and wealthy and focused on the finer things in life. In many ways, after the drudgery of her disciplined uncle's approach to live, this is refreshing to Kit. It's a bit of common ground. John Holbrook is simply a wonderful man...a wonderful, wonderful man. And that is why he is the perfect fit for the one who steals his heart. And Nat...well, there is a special person waiting for Nat.Hannah - The old Quaker woman living at the edge of Blackbird Pond offers a focal point for the colony's mistrust of Kit and the things that they don't understand. Some in the colony push for Kit to be examined and tried as a witch when she engages in behaviors that shock or confuse them. Hannah is equally suspected as a Quaker. The Puritans believe Quakers to be heathens and Hannah in particular, to be a witch. All this tinderbox needs is a match...and Kit is it. Despite starting out a little quiet and slow, this story turns into a high-drama with heart palpitating moments that leave you turning the pages.As a side note, I attended a Quaker high school and learned a lot about their early persecution not just in England, but when they came to America just as it's described in this tale. The Puritans actually drove the Quakers out of their colony and most ended up settling in the Pennsylvania area under the safe umbrella of William Penn, a fellow Quaker and the founder of the colony. By the way, did you know that \`Quaker' was not the term they gave themselves? Their name for themselves is The Society of Friends. I have to say personally that I think very highly of this denomination after my affiliation with it for years and I feel that the Hannah character was extremely true to the personality and demeanor of the Friends I've met.In the end, the people of the colony all have to decide where they stand as the crowds come for Hannah and Kit. Do they stand on the side of logic, understanding, science, and forgiveness? Or do they stand on the side of emotion, judgement, and fear? This book is a classic historical ya story with romance and tension and intrigue. It also highlights the differences between people's manner of thought in these times and the way that those differences affected every decision they made. Though it was set so long ago, it could easily be re-written today with a metaphorical \`witchhunt'.I absolutely LOVED this story and still do. I am thinking about re-reading it in coming weeks actually. I highly recommend it to the ya reading world because it's old enough that it's different from a lot of what you read, yet the themes of love and loss are timeless."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I've avoided this book, thinking it was a rehash of stories about women accused of being witches during the early days of America. It was about women accused of being witches, but it was really about so much more. Kit impulsively hops on a ship to America after the death of her grandfather, leaving behind the beautiful tropical islands where she was so freely raised. She goes to find a home with her only remaining relatives, her mother's sister and her family. Kit's aunt, she learns, has been worn down by life in America and by her marriage to a Puritan man. But these characters are not stiff stereotypes; the harshly Puritan uncle loves American freedom, not the English king; the dangerous witch the community fears is really a quiet, lonely Quaker woman; the man who loves Kit fails to step forward to help her when Kit is in trouble. An excellent, thoughtful story of how being different can both threaten a society and build a society."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I recommend this book to all who have children! THis book is an excellent addition to any library.Set in a time that was full of suspicion and lies. If you wanted to get rid of someone that you didn't like, just accuse them of being a witch!

At the end, I felt like crying. It's just such a beautiful, moving book. I would definitely recommend it for any age above pre-teen, as it does include graphic information about the witch trials that could be upsetting to young children.

The Witch of Blackbird Pond is the coming of age tale of sixteen-year-old Kathrine Tyler of Barbados as she comes to live in the late 1600 colony of Connecticut. Coming from luxurious Barbados, Kathrine, also known as Kit, has a lot of surprises awaiting her in the bleak colony of Connecticut. As Kit sees the bleak New England shoreline from the boat, she begins to wonder whether or not coming to New England is such a good idea after all. When she arrives in Connecticut, her Aunt Rachel, and her Uncle Matthew take her in. As she begins to live with her relatives, she starts to realize that living in New England is no easy task, for she must work all day carding wool, weeding vegetables, and doing other hard and time consuming tasks. Coming from a rich home in Barbados, this isn't at all what she had expected! Kit also attracts the attention of fellow townsfolk by revealing that she can swim, read well, and that she wears silk and satin dresses. Little does she know that many of her considered to be odd behaviors by the fellow townsfolk may end up getting her suspected of being a witch! After befriending an old Quaker, and suspected witch, it is only a matter of time before the townsfolk accuse her of being a witch! As the story progresses, it becomes intense and suspenseful. Aiding to the suspense is a witch-hunt, a government dispute, and many other intense scenes. I have only read the book once, but I can still tell that Elizabeth George Speare spent put tons and tons of effort into writing this book. Throughout the book, I noticed that she was very descriptive with the style of clothing, colonial architect, food, religion, customs, and scenery. Her description of the setting was so realistic that it felt like I was actually in the story, not just reading it. To be descriptive as she was, it must of token her hours upon hours of time just to do the research alone for her book. Her vivid descriptions of her characters and their actions and feelings really make you wonder how you would act and feel if you were in their position. Even though action is absent throughout much of the book, I still found it incredibly interesting and almost impossible to put down. Where the story lacks in action, it abounds in a detailed plot that is guaranteed to keep any reader hooked. And when you do get to the action in the book, it is literally impossible to put down! Why you might walk right of a cliff and still continue to read it without noticing anything! It's that good! I give this book a ten plus out of five for it's creativity and it's ability to grip any reader's attention. For these reasons, I would highly recommend this extremely good book to anyone, especially historical fiction fans."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I read this book in fourth grade and I still rember the wonderful book!

The story takes place in 1687.Katherine \\"Kit\\" Tyler lived with her grandfather in Barbados on his large plantation. When he died, Kit sold everything to pay the workers and to not leave any debt. Unfortunately, that left her with nothing. She decided to travel by ship to Connecticut to live with her aunt and uncle.When Kit arrives, she learns that things are very different in the Puritan settlement than she is used to. It is hard for her to become used to this way of life, but she manages because she is a strong and fiercely determined girl!Kit becomes friends with an old woman named Hannah, who has been ostracized by the Puritan community because she is a Quaker. The Puritans call her \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond.\\" Kit feels a sort of kinship with her and, even though she has been forbidden by her uncle, she visits Hannah as often as she can. The only other person to be brave enough to visit Hannah is Nat Eaton, a sailor who brings goods to Hannah whenever he returns to the settlement. Hannah found Nat in the meadow by her house when he was a young boy in the same manner that she found Kit: sobbing! Just as she had done with Kit, she had invited Nat back to her home for some blueberry cake and to cuddle her cats. The kindly woman was, and continues to be, such a comfort to him!In the meadow by Blackbird Pond, Kit finds a young girl named Prudence. Just as Hannah had done to her, Kit invites Prudence back to Hannah's house explaining that it is a safe and loving place for her to visit. Kit was taught by her grandfather to read, although it was practically unheard of at that time for a girl to have learned this important skill. She taught Prudence not only how to read but also to write in cursive.When sickness befalls the community and the children start dying, the residents decide that the Witch must be to blame! Kit risks everything to get to Hannah's house before the mob, and she and Hannah hide in the bushes watching while the mob burns down her house and searches for her. Luckily, Nat's boat returns the following morning and he takes Hannah aboard and brings her to live with his aunt in a town where she will be safe.Although Hannah escaped safely, Kit was arrested for helping and consorting with a witch and was accused of even being a witch herself! Who will come to Kit's defense?We loved this book! Kit is a fabulous character. She faces adversity with such admirable strength. This is our second book by Speare (we previously read The Sign of the Beaver), and we love that Speare's protagonists are non-judgmental and have acceptance of those who are different.This book also inspired a lot of discussion about Puritans, Quakers, and the Salem Witch trials.MY RATING: 5 stars!! We loved it!! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I bought this book before I read some of the detailed reviews praising the story for children and teens.

Kit, who had been raised by her grandfather, while living in Barbados, has forced her to move in with her aunt and uncle in Connecticut, due to her grandfather's death. Things are much different in the colonies of Connecticut though. Life is not the same for Kit, doing chores and having strict adult figures is not something she is used to. People around town look at Kit in disbelief, as her dress, attitude, and disrespect is unacceptable.Of course with all of the new, bad news, comes some good news. Kit has made some friends. William, one of the most attractive men in town has shown interest. Perhaps Kit will find love in this unknown place? Then again, she has become fond of the one person who is despised and disowned by the town, who is believed to be a witch. Will Kit ever be accepted by the residents of Wethersfield, especially after they find out who her new friend is? Can Kit learn to not be judgmental, or will she struggle forever to once again find happiness? This book will keep any read hooked as its suspense, setting, and many sub-plots within, will urge you to keep reading. I loved this book and think that many could enjoy it.

Things were really hard, now having to work herself when she had not so much as washed the dishes in her life. She loved her cousins and her aunt, but she just could not stand it.Eventually, Kit meets this kind, sweet, elderly Lady named Hannah Tupper. Everyone thinks she is a witch and the blame every thing that goes wrong on her. It mostly is because she is a Quaker, a group of people that had a different religous beleifs than all of the other people in town. Kit knows that Hannah is not a witch and cares for her, and refuses to turn her down.I like this book, but it was not one of my very favorites. The style the author used was a very interesting way of doing it, but it confused me, and got me lost at times. One of the reasons I admire this book is because it teaches you that everyone has choices in life, whether they are good or bad. People seem to be judging people at all times now, and back then, it was just as bad. I like this book, and suggest for those who like historical fiction, to read this book too."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"I can read this book over a dozen times--I think I have!

She goes aboard the ship, the Dolphin, heading for Connecticut Colony, and wishes to live a better life at her aunt's house. While on the way, she becomes friends with the captain's son, Nat Eaton, John Holbrook, a man planning on becoming a minister, and Prudence, a little girl. When she finally arrives at her destination, she tries to fit in with the Puritans, and to keep up with her lively cousin, Judith, and her gentle one, Mercy. After a number of different accidents in the family and outside, she finds becomes friends with an old Quaker woman named Hannah, that lives at Blackbird Pond, who is said to be a witch. Kit does not believe this, and she keeps on being friends with the old woman. But, the villagers see Kit as a threat to the community, since they do not trust her as being a friend to their witch, and she goes on trial. Just as she thinks she is doomed, Nat Eaton and Prudence save her. However, Kit discovers that she will never fit in with the Puritans, and planned on going on the Dolphin the next time the ship came. Finally, the ship docks, and she goes on it, for what seems to be a much better future.My favorite part of the book was where Kit goes on trial. I thought of this at my favorite part for I think it is very interesting to hear how other people act to problems and try to blame it on someone else. I think it is very funny how people think of small problems and turn them into what sounds like a major disasters performed by a witch. I like the part where Prudence comes in, and stuns her own parents by doing what they had never thought she would be able to do, which was reading the Bible and writing her own name. I think it is not right when parents think very little about kids and think they are still their little babies that always need their parents to help them.I recommend this book to kids the ages of 10 and up. I also recommend adults to read this book and learn the facts of how kids can do things without any help from their parents or any one else. I believe Elizabeth George Speare is a great author who has written many books that I have enjoyed. After reading this book, I came to really enjoy it. At first I thought it was very boring, but in the end, it became more interesting and fun. I also learned not to judge anyone by what people say about them, but you should always think about your judgement before actually thinking about if it is true or not. I now understand the meaning of \\"Never judge a book by its cover.\\""},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"From the moment she arrives from Barbados to live with her aunt and uncle, Kit Tyler is an outcast.

It was filled with excitment, love, and suspense. Elizabeth George Speare kept me going with wonder. I could hardly wait until I got to the end. Speare has a way of fitting everything together with her characters. The main character, Kit Tyler, is brought to life by her nobility attribute, her independent disposition, and her careless and brave ways. The way Speare brings couples together in the novel is amazing. I am a firm believer in helping people and having healthy relationships; Speare displays this so thoughtful through the witch and Kit Tyler. Even though it was entirly fiction, you feel like you are really there through the whole thing. As I had said before, this was a very unique book. The way that it skips what could be boring events and goes straight to the important ones in each chapter is impecable. It keeps the reader focused on the true plot of the story. The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that the trial was not as suspenceful as I hoped it would be, but other that, my imagingation ran wild.

New York: Yearling, 1987Martin, Michelle H. \\"Hey, Who' the Kid with the Green Umbrella?: Re-evaluating the Black-A-Moor and Little Black Sambo.\\" The Lion and the Unicorn 22 (1998): 147-162Kit Tyler gazes for the first time at the cold shores of Connecticut Colony. This is going to be her new home, and it doesn't compare to the Caribbean Islands she left behind. Not only does she feel like an outcast when she moves to this Puritan community, but when she meets a witch and they become friends, Kit encounters suspicion, fear, and anger. Elizabeth George Speare has written a well constructed and outstanding historical novel, The Witch of Blackbird Pond, of a girl who wants to overcome the hatred of this place she is made to live and call her new home. The use of such words as \\"staring hungrily at the first sight of land...\\"(Kit) gives us a better picture of this particular scene and the emotions she felt as she saw land for the first time in a while. This also sets the scenes in the book because the reader can feel like they are part of the book. Kit feels like a social outcast, and her community made her feel this way. Although this story was written in the 20th Century Speare wanted to portray life in the 17th Century. This is done by sharing the values the Puritans had and the way the people in her community feels. This novel depicts a never-ending battle that has been going for many centuries between the so-called \`outcasts' of society. In her article \\"Hey, Who's the Kid with the Umbrella?: Re-evaluating the Black-A-Moor and Little Black Sambo\\", Dr. Michelle H. Martin says that black children were virtually invisible in children's literature until the 1960's, and this is shown to be true in this story. (147) Even though this story was written in the 20th Century, there were not any black children in this book. In fact, there were not many of the other races either in the book. I am sure there were other than white people on this boat so why aren't they mentioned in the text? Martin's article goes on to talk of the two books that depict African Americans better but I feel that more stories should, especially recent stories, should talk about other cultures in some way. Despite this problem, however, I feel that The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a wonderful and intriguing book filled with unexpected events and an outstanding ending.This was a wonderful way to depict the hardships going on during this time period."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said, but I'll say it anyway. I love this book. Kit is an easy to like character with good qualities and faults just like you and I but she is completely likable. Plus, I find that there is not a boring part in this book. It is interesting to see how she, the &quot;little bird&quot; that doesn't seem to belong anywhere but in Barbados, tries to fit into a place where she thinks she can't. In time she finds her place and feels accepted, but it's how she got there that makes this book so engrossing."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"This book was very interesting and the characters were very interesting as well as all of the settings.

When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch. She secretly becomes good friends with Widow Tupper, and the Widow helps her get her job back in the school, and secretly teaches Prudence how to read. Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what. I think this is a wonderful book for all ages, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as it did."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"If you like unique settings and plots, and also the supernatural and what people thought about it, then this book is a really good match for you. One of the main focuses is the Puritan community. It provides, in indepth detail, the customs, beliefs, rituals, and everyday life of an average Puritan in 1687. Another focus is the American colonies in the late 1600s and the friction between the king of England and the settlers. It's really the start of the Revolutionary War, and it shows how it started. And, of course, another point of this book is unjust persecution of people with minor differences or far-fetched accusations. As with the Salem witch trials, persecution of &quot;witches&quot;, or people of a different religion, as with Hannah Tupper in this book, was common in that period and that place. An interesting part of this book was the character of Mercy, and also the character of Judith. The sisters are alike and different in many ways. You have to go deep into their character to really understand that they have the same views about family. But another unique idea in this book was that the &quot;beautiful&quot; one wasn't nessecarily the nicest. And as one of my closing statements I would like to add that back in the late 1600s, when you were different, suspicion was cast upon you for no just reason, and it made you more vulnerable to the blame. Also, women and children weren't treated as fairly as today, and readers have to understand that. To conclude my report, this book is as unique as they come. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Witch of Blackbird Pond (Bookwise Guide)","review":"Barry Moser illustrates this reissue of a Newbery Award-winning story of a girl marked by suspicion from the moment she enters colonial Connecticut in 1687.

I love the way she explained with detail every setting as it changed. For example, when the setting changed from the boat to Weithersfield, she explained what the setting was like as Kit's opinion about this place. She described it as having flat, square houses and nothing like Barbadoes, where she used to live. Another example is when the setting changed during the witch hunt for Kit's friend, Hannah, an old, sweet lady who is accused of being a witch. She described very well the mob of people and the burning of Hannah's house. She Also described very well the house of her cousins, The Woods. Not only did she describe the setting well but characters and their feelings, like how hard the chores were to Kit and how Mercy and John loved each other so much.This novel is an excellent one and anyone who has the opportunity to read it should."},{"Title":"The Song of Our Syrian Guest / a Shepherd's Song","review":"I received this book as a youth from my sunday school teacher.

It was written, I believe, in the early 1900's.The Song of Our Syrian Guest / a Shepherd's Song"},{"Title":"Chimney Swifts: America's Mysterious Birds above the Fireplace (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"5 years ago we built our house and the builder (thankfully) forgot to put on a chimney cap. That was when I discovered chimney swifts and have enjoyed them in our chinmeny every year. I've been starved for details about these wonderful friends. When I saw that Paul and Georgean Kyle had written a book I *knew* this would be the book to get. They were the first people I found on the internet when I started researching chimney swifs. Because they also do chimney swift rehabilitation, they have been up close and personal with chimney swifts for years. They really know their stuff. They track the chimney swift arrivals across the county each spring, and they host the \\"chimney swift night out\\" each fall. They are definitely the experts in my mind and this book is terrific. Throughout the book there are amazing close-up photographs and wonderful drawings to accompany the text. The writing is really enjoyable, like talking with a friend. A very fun, easy, and extremely informative read. I had a hard time putting the book down each night. They cover topics like swift social behavior, courting, nesting, nest building, hatchling development, flight/maneuvers, roosting behavior, migration times and destinations, etc. They also include excellent information on habitat and what we can do to help chimney swifts. Their population has been declining since the 80s and we need to help. There's info on building a chimney swift tower and more. This is a wonderful book that will teach you all about the life and times of chimney swifts and give you ideas for helping them survive into the future. Excellent book. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat and I'm so glad they wrote this book. It has given me so much insight and understanding into what's going on in our chimney. As I write this now, it's late April in Virginia and our swifts arrived just two weeks ago. I can hear them chittering in the chimney, no doubt discussing where to put their nest :)."},{"Title":"The Bible, Sex, and this Generation: How God's Word Applies Today","review":"it is really a amazing book, all the information is excellent, and show how the church corrupt the marriage, it show how business manipulated the ceremony that in principle is very simple and wonderful from God's view. I recommend to translate to Spanish language"},{"Title":"Confusion in the Pews: How We Can Make Our Church Catholic Again - One Parish at a Time","review":"This book is important reading for Catholics who take the practice of their Faith seriously. Time and again, during recent years, we have seen purportedly &quot;Catholic\\" authorities, speaking through the media, contradicting beliefs universally taught pre-Vatican II.Has the Church changed so radically? Is what was once wrong, wrong no longer? Does it matter if the formal liturgy of the Mass is changed by the Celebrant? Why?Cecilia Martin documents many abuses, justified by their proponents as &quot;reform,&quot; currently assailing the Church. She shows how enemies hijacked the genuine reforms of Vatican II and selectively misinterpreted them to promote an agenda aimed at its destruction. Far fetched? Read the book! It is well written and referenced. Reach your own conclusions. If they are the same as Cecilia's, follow her advice on how to counteract this attack from within."},{"Title":"Confusion in the Pews: How We Can Make Our Church Catholic Again - One Parish at a Time","review":"The \\"reforms\\" which many believe to have been initiated by Vatican II are not actually reforms but rebellions, and some of the rebellions mentioned in this book are incredible (a woman dressed in an alb and stole \\"concelebrating\\" a Holy Mass and even hearing confessions!).Priests, bishops, and even some cardinals have rejected the authority of Rome in favor of their own view of what true Catholic worship should be. The result has been a departure from the vertical worship of true liturgy to the horizontal worship of modernism, indifferentism, Americanism, and naturalism. Naturally this departure does not only manifest itself in liturgical abuses, but also in doctrinal abuses (contradicting the Church's stand on birth control, homosexuality, abortion; preaching heresy from the pulpit; inviting blatantly anti-Catholic speakers to speak at Catholic retreats and seminars).The book gives the best possible advice for those who really want to understand why the quality of our liturgy has declined so terribly in the last few decades; read the Bible, the Catechism, the Vatican II conciliar documents, and the Code of Canon Law; confront (respectfully) the priests who are committing liturgical abuses (I say respectfully because some of them are heretics, while others may truly not know that something they are doing is actually an abuse); confront the bishop; and if necessary, write the Vatican.I give this book five stars. I was considering only four, since the English usage is so bad. This book is an example of why a good proofreader is necessary and a spell checker is not enough (\\"form\\" instead of \\"from\\"; \\"principal\\" instead of \\"principle\\"; etc.)."},{"Title":"Confusion in the Pews: How We Can Make Our Church Catholic Again - One Parish at a Time","review":"Cecilia Martin has succinctly presented the background of the present problems in the Catholic Church and who is responsible. All of us need this book to tell us how to defend our church from its enemies within and how to find and use the resources of the Church to be intelligent, well-informed Catholics and apologists. Thanks!"},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"Though it would initially seem aimed at applying to undergraduate schools, &quot;On Writing the College Application Essay&quot; is excellent for essay writing in general (including MBA applications :-).The first half emphasizes the importance of knowing your audience. Although we're inclined to think nobel laureates will pore over our applications, the reality is they're screened by the Sarah Bleary and Henry Haggards of the world: real folks who see so many applications, that they struggle to differentiate them.Knowing your audience is only one part of the equation. In the essay, you must convince the reader that you're YOU. Instead, many applicants portray themselves based on what they think the admissions committee wants, often to the extent of sweeping banalities. Bauld explores several of these with his sharp wit. Perhaps the funniest is Pet Death: &quot;As I watched Buttons' life ebb away, I came to value the important things in this world.&quot;In the second half, Bauld suggests you take a chill pill, then start keeping a notebook of any ideas an observations -- anything. Eventually you'll start to relax enough that your writing will come alive. However, before it can come alive, you must get something on paper.You'll continuously refine and tighten your opus, and the author gives several suggestions of how to approach this, with examples of first, second and third drafts.Finally, Bauld includes several different essays, a few from college applications, and most not. Each of these conveys a different style but illustrates the crux of the book: you gotta be you."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"I've read several books on the college application process and it is clear that the essay plays a major role in determining whether or not an applicant is accepted. Mr. Bauld has written an entertaining, informative and very easy-to-read book that is also thankfully short. No long-winded, self-congratulatory filler here! It gets right to the point and is generous with excellent examples. In fact, this book is a great resource not only for those prepping to write a college application essay, but it contains great advice for writers in general. This book is well worth its reasonable price for the ideas, motivation and examples it provides. Now I need to get a clue from Mr. Bauld and keep this short and to the point. Bye."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"This book gives an excellent and easy to read look at writing your college application essay. If you are just going to read a book and not do the exercises, this is a great choice - it doesn't have any exercises. Instead, the emphasis is on finding your own voice and telling your story. For example, he gives a list of the most overused, deadly topics and then shows how you can write a really good essay on one of the &quot;forbidden&quot; topics. He also includes a number of sample essays with comments from real college admissions officers - so you can see for yourself the difference between good, bad and mediocre."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"This is not only the best book on writing the college application essay, but one of the best books about writing, period. With amazingly fresh and funny examples throughout, it shows how bored admissions officers are by the pompous, self-congratulatory essays that students often think they're supposed to write--and how those students can do much, much better. It literally changed my daughter's life, not only because she got into the very competitive college of her choice, but because she now is a sharper, more interesting writer."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"I teach high school juniors, and we have a unit on writing the college admissions essay. This is one of the best on the subject that I've read. It is short, which will appeal to the teenage reader, and it is humorous, which appealed to me and, I am sure, will appeal to them. My daughter, who is in the midst of writing the application essay, read the book. To me, that is high praise. I recommend it."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"As Bauld states up front, the proper question is not - &quot;What should my essay be about?&quot; - but rather - &quot;What should I avoid?&quot; Speaking from the position of someone who has had to endure the tedious job of reading college admissions essays, Bauld describes the process from *their* point of view to give the reader some insight into things that will immediately get you relegated to the &quot;reject&quot; or &quot;wait list&quot; stack. The list of cliches is short, easy to understand, and easy to identify in my own attempts at writing.In addition to that invaluable service of pointing out the pitfalls, the book offers some basic guidelines on essay writing. Obviously, it can't replace years of slacking off in school, so most students should know some of these things before they begin the admissions process, but it doesn't hurt to have a concise list of what to do and especially what *not* to do. I liked having the refresher - sometimes we have to be reminded about little rules and annoyances."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"To anyone who is looking to give their college application a little something special, this book is a must. I was accepted yesterday to a top 50 school from a community college largely, in my opinion, because of this book. While other factors were involved, this book helped me to form and shape a really attractive and unique essay which made me stand out from others. He doesn't have any magical formula, and the applicant will have to work for it, but he gives you the right tools to craft an essay that is a work of art. Trust me, if you don't get any other book for college, get this one! It's well worth the money!"},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"This book really helped me through the college application process. I was having a hard time trying to come up with a topic that wouldn't put admission officers to sleep, and this book did exactly that. Harry Bauld worked for a university and knows what catches the eye and what doesn't. I was able to come up with a clever topic for my essay. This may sound too good to be true, but my essays, with the advice and tips on from Harry Bauld, partially helped me get a full scholarship to college. I highly recommend this book to anyone having any trouble writing essays! Good luck!"},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"This is one exceptional and extraordinary book that I have ever read in the ever-eventful approach to climacteric college application essays. I have examined through 35 or so similar self-help related books with a &quot;magnifier and a fine-tooth-comb,&quot; and all have particularly failed in comparison to Harry Bauld's work of art. Bauld's book is the quintessential of this topic. His book unquestionably stood out from all the other books (like an illuminated Eiffel Tower in a dark Parisian night). Bauld's book is that vital &quot;compass&quot; bewildered high school students ache for in order to get across that catastrophic hurdle of applying to colleges. Bauld teaches (with intense &amp; witty humor) the reader to concretely compose for themselves (in an invigorating and upstanding technique-form) an essay that upholds the applicant's chances in getting into &quot;The Dream&quot; University, rather than have it end up in the &quot;round file.&quot; Bauld's meticulous methods are fair and justified. He distinctly illustrates his accounts on the How, What, When, Where &amp; Why, as well as the bloopers most writers have mistakenly included in their essays. One revelation that should catch an ordinary John or Jane Doe's eye is that Harry Bauld has been behind the admissions scene at Ivy League Schools (Brown and Columbia). In essence, he is not of the countless, clueless or ignorant high school college counselors that often misinform and misdirect students on the applicants' approaches to the &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot; Bauld takes you to the Ballpark and coaches you through the entire game: from the initial thought process, to brainstorming of ideas, to the roughdraft stages of writing and to the finale of editing. He narrates on the &quot;McGwirean-homerun-hitting-essays&quot; as well as those critically &quot;how-to-strike-out-essays.&quot; He includes inconceivable and exemplary essays that &quot;got in,&quot; and model essays that &quot;got tossed.&quot; Moreover, this book not only serves the solo purpose for high school students applying to colleges, but for college students applying to higher elite institutions as well. I am a living testimony to this. I had extreme difficulty drafting a convincing essay to Stanford University. After exercising the guerilla tactics by Bauld, I got accepted! Last but not least, this is one book that teaches you to write better. Indeed, Bauld's book is the super-octane gasoline any lost applicant needs to drive from Point A to Point B in the college application essay process. I give this book five stars and two thumbs up (way up)! Harry Bauld's winning book will lead you through the minefield! Remember: a winner picks a winner."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"I'm more than willing to admit that I started my applications extremely late--as in, during winter break--and there is no way I could have written my 10 application essays over 14 days without this book. Truthfully, I wouldn't have had any clue where to begin.Although it might seem that this book is outdated, the principles of writing are timeless. The various topics to avoid (e.g. vacation stories), the stress on normal everyday language, the use of colorful and distinctive narratives...all are as applicable today as they were when \\"On Writing the College Application Essay\\" was first published. Besides giving you suggestions on what and how to write, though, Harry Bauld actually teaches you the process. For one, there are various writing and brainstorming exercises throughout the book. Plus, his writing itself serves as an excellent model of his lessons; the book is entertaining, distinctive, and easy to follow.At least for me, the most useful part of this book was the model essays included at the end. Some are actual application essays--both successful and unsuccessful--and they're followed by commentary on what the writer did well, what the reader can infer about the applicant, etc. Other examples are essays by famous published writers, and even though they obviously weren't application essays, it's clear that they could have been. The best part? Since Bauld himself is a former Ivy League admissions officer, we can trust his judgment.Although it is *not* my aim to brag, it seems relevant here: this past spring, I was admitted to both my dream colleges, Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania. One admissions officer's comment? I have a strong voice in my writing.Mr. Harry Bauld surely deserves some of the credit."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"As noted by many others, this is a very good book for helping applicants write their essays. But this book should not replace a guide to college admissions; in fact, while Bauld does a great job focusing on the essay, his does miss a few important tips and strategies that the more general guides include. I suggest buying this book along with books by Jay Mathews or Andrew Allen--two very good, general guides."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"In the film world,it's about audience.

It may be fabulous. The author does use humor and lots of examples to help. However, I was applying to graduate school, and the essay style is completely different (at least it was for all of my applications).The graduate essay requires a wealth of specific information to be included. Specific, biographical information including past jobs and relevant experiences. This book discourages such broad essays - the very ones required by most graduate programs (at least in psychology). For grad school applicants, I recommend \\"How to Write a Winning Personal Statement for Graduate and Professional School\\" by Richard Stelzer. Not only is it thought-provoking and well written, it includes sections for specific programs (medical, law, business, etc.)"},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"This is my first purchase on Amazon and I'm pleased with it.

There's also tips on how to improve and edit your essays as well as which types of essays to avoid so that you don't bore your reader. You definitely will not regret buying this book.

The first 50 pages of this book provide more useful information than the phonebook sized guides that are sold everywhere. The insider information on how your application will be processed and what will make it stand out is golden. The author outlines several mistakes that I would think almost everyone is at least tempted to make (trying to \\"sell yourself\\" in the essay). He also captures that random nature of college acceptance without making you feel hopeless. The book is also a good primer on writing interesting and entertaining pieces, especially useful for the student that is not strong in this area.

I had an average GPA, good test scores, and average extracurriculars, so it was pretty much up to the essay to determine whether or I would get into college.

Furthermore, Mr. Bauld wrote like a tutor beside you to inform you how to present a great masterpiece that can affect in your application. What I have read are the methods to create the essays you wanna show to the officers. We often have a lot ideas in mind but do not know how to organize them and change them into an essay, that is what this book will help us to solve!"},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"The personal essay is one of the less important factors in a college application. Your high school transcript and test scores are paramount, and the author of this book, a former college admissions dean himself, doesn't pretend that the essay counts for more than it really does. However, the personal essay can be a tie-breaker between two similarly-qualified applicants, so it pays to put time and care into the essay section, even though it can be the most time-consuming, challenging part of an application.Back in my frenzied college application days, I read a couple of college application books. Most were mind-numbingly boring, both in style and content. This book, however, was a delight to read and by far the best of the lot. It's the only college application advice book that I was willing to buy for myself and that I would be willing to read again. I've still got my copy. It's witty, elegant, focused, and wise, both artistic and practical; everything a good book (of any kind) should be. It transcends mere advice/strategy and is really about the pursuit of excellence.It has proved useful even beyond those hectic high school days, because Bauld knows that to be able to write a good college application essay, one has to write well. That means the essay you submit to those various colleges and universities should ideally be something that a person would choose to read in their spare time, or at the very least, that reading it should not involve mental pain for the harried admissions office worker to whom it is assigned. A tall order, perhaps. The personal essay is an art, and Bauld includes both excellent examples of essays both from high-school age college applicants and from masters of the form such as George Orwell, H.L. Mencken, and E.B. White. He also shows you what clich&eacute;s to avoid, and what writing mistakes are the most common.You will be inspired to write a better essay if you read this book. Also, as a coda, yeah, I did get into the school that was my first choice, though my initial joy faded into more complicated and contradictory feelings over time. But I don't regret that I made my best effort."},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance and the College of your Choice","review":"As a senior English teacher, this is one of the best resources I've come across on the topic of writing the college application essay.

And before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave and go home to my Lord and be free\\"__Old Negro SpiritualThe words of the spiritual above must not have been uttered to these beautiful human beings who have graciously allowed interviewers from the 1930's Governments Works Progress Administration to chronicle their life stories. For if the words above had been uttered, the slave experience, from an intimate and painful point of view, would never have received the credence they due. Tales of slavery are still passed down from generation to generation, and traditions still are followed but to see a book like Unchained Memories is special. Quite simply, this is a beautiful book. I'm so thrilled to have been given the opportunity to read it and experience it and learn from it. I can treat the book as a textbook, a factual accounting of the lives of former slaves who have wonderful stories that they don't mind sharing with the world. For that reason alone, this book has earned a permanent place on my coffee table, for all who enter into my house to experience. Something about the actual words of former slaves bound in book form validates an agonizing time in American History.Unchained Memories is well researched and magnificently laid out. At the beginning of every chapter is an introductory text that accounts for the tenure of the time, followed by a poignant quote and then brief narratives begin. My one regret is that the narratives are so short, when biographers obviously spent a great deal of time with these people. I am grateful that there is an extensive bibliography at the back so that I can, at some point, go and read the entire account by the former slave. Oh where will I find the time? If you read this book, I would highly suggest that you get a copy of the HBO documentary of the same name and watch it as well. There is nothing like \\"hearing\\" the words spoken by African American actors of today in the vernacular of the time.I'm glad that Unchained Memories was published, and quite fittingly made its debut during Black History Month. These former slaves are the reason why Black History Month is perpetuated now and a fitting tribute for remembering from whence we as a nation have come."},{"Title":"Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives","review":"An exquisite pictorial and narrative exploration of the institution of American slavery, this book provides readers with the opportunity to experience from personal recollections what it was like to live under conditions of slavery. The text format, an artistic balance of photographs and primary sources, is composed of interviews with former slaves conducted in the 1930s by the Federal Writers' Project. Each chapter focuses on a particular aspect of slave life - auctions, work, family, special occasions, providing a deeply etched portrait of hardships and abuses as well as examples of strength of character and quiet dignity. A worthy addition to one's library!"},{"Title":"Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives","review":"In this beautiful, historical collection of slave narratives and photographs, we are given a look inside the lives of actual slaves being interviewed as part of a project conducted by the Works Progress Administration. With more than forty interviews, UNCHAINED MEMORIES is a work of art that provides a well-rounded look at the lives of slaves. It includes insight into their living conditions, thoughts about slavery, their families and even the details of actual slave auctions. It is a sometimes sad collection, but much needed to help us understand the progress our ancestors have made in the world.Through their accounts, we are able to see the pain and suffering as well as the spirit and pride of those born into slavery, learn from it, and pass it along to our children. This is a wonderful resource for not only African American families, but for anyone interested in history and the period of slavery and its impact upon the African American race. It is compiled with the grace and dignity deserving of a people who have been through so much!Reviewed by Tee C.

I use them both in the high school classroom as reference materials for our study of slavery before we read Mark Twain's \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" [My core novel is Julius Lester's \\"To Be a Slave.\\"]\\"Unchained Memories\\" is broken into eight thematic chapters: 1. Slave Auctions 2. Work 3. Family 4. Living Conditions 5. Abuse 6. Special Occasions 7. The Runaway 8. EmancipationIn addition to numerous excerpts from the Federal Writers' Projects interviews, there are numerous illustrations and photos (including many of the former slaves excerpted in this book). Seeing actual photos of these ex-slaves (taken at the time of the interviews in the late 1930s) adds a personal connection to their stories.While the HBO film utilized dramatic readings, the words of these former slaves are so powerful they grip the reader from beginning to end.

If you are a single man (or woman) over 25, I recommend reading \\"Christian Courtship in an Oversexed World\\" and \\"Boy Meets Girl\\" instead. That's why I gave this book only 3 stars.A large point that Mr. Wood makes is that our \\"culture\\" needs to change. I strongly agree. Over the past 35 years, gender roles have become confused, and some men don't know how to act like men. Men haven't taken responsibility, and our society has seen the results of this \\"selfishness\\" (divorce, single mothers, sexually transmitted diseases, acceptance of premarital sex, growth of pornography, deadbeat dads, fathers who abandon children, etc.) Men need to be more involved with raising children, and need to understand the meaning of the words \\"commitment\\" and \\"responsibility.\\"Another point I liked: Mr. Wood goes the distance that \\"secular dating\\" is only as old as the automobile, and there has been much heartbreak in this world from the \\"superficialness\\" that has infiltrated our society, particularly my generation. I liked how he emphasized that men need to think about early on what to do with their lives, and if they are called to marriage, begin preparing for that call. Women also need to be treated with upmost respect also. In my generation, my public high school crowd that consisted of intelligent and mature young adults who were not troublemakers (science club guys, Scouts, choir people, etc.) were seen as \\"nerds.\\" Hopefully that is changing.I would recommend this book (and the one for girls) to high school audiences, and a good one for parents to discuss with their children. Mr. Wood talks about things like chaperoning, boundaries of affection, and finding sponsored couples during your college years. I agree with going out in groups, and I agree with people developing other interests (hobbies, etc.) that they are not spending every waking moment with one other person.As far as affection, I feel that some affection such as handholding and hugs are fine. As far as finding sponsor couples in college, that sounds like a great mentoring tool, but that would be hard to find. However, it would be a great suggestion for a strong Catholic Newman Center to put together.This would also be a good resource (and the one for girls) to use for say a parish youth group (Life Teen nites, etc.) where the girls and boys could be separated. This would be a good start, and the Life Teen curriculum does cover some of this (I was a Life Teen Core Team member for about 18 months.) The same thing could be done at a Catholic High School for either a seminar or a short course in Theology, should the administration be open to it.Quite frankly, I would love to see some Catholic High Schools and parish youth groups do something like this. It is sad that several of our \\"Catholic High Schools\\" and \\"Catholic Colleges\\" are really just \\"Catholic in name\\" only academic institutions, and have the same problems as our \\"public institutions\\" (drugs, premarital sex, immorality, watered down teaching, etc.). This is part of the reason that many Catholics who have attended some of these \\"Catholic in-name\\" institutions are no longer practicing the faith. Personally, I think a lot of parents are unaware of some of the \\"watering down\\" that has taken place in many \\"Catholic\\" schools and even at some parish youth groups. This is where \\"parental involvement\\" needs to come into more, and make sure that what is being taught is the teachings of the Holy Catholic Church.Fortunately, there are some truly solid institutions out there (Catholic colleges) that can be found. Mr. Wood has put together some literature about finding a truly solid Catholic Institution that can be ordered from the Family Life Center website.Appreciate your efforts Mr. Wood. You are also helping men out there to take more of an interest in Family Life, and Practice their faith. Keep it up."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife: How to find & marry a great girl","review":"Mr. Woods clearly believes in courtship as opposed to dating. I must agree with Fr. David's review in many respects, that the book is mechanical and written from one viewpoint. As a Catholic, I had previously read \\"Boy Meets Girl,\\" and similar courtship books. As someone over 30, courtship in its intended form does not work well. Mr. Woods is a bit incorrect; women were riding (daytime) in carriages with men in the 1800s unchaperoned, but usually in the eyes of the community; dashing Mr. Wilder drove Laura home accompanied for 12 miles each Friday during her semester teaching away from home. . . The book is a bit mechanical in its approach, and many families with different issues can still raise good people. The advice given basically sounds like those who don't marry young are wrong or selfish---not considering that maybe we were in the military, back in college, etc. and didn't meet anyone with potential. I expect a wife to work until she has children, and then we will make the decision as a family as to what is best; many women now telecommute, work part-time when their husband can provide childcare, teach college classes online or one evening a week, or run home-based businesses, much like the wife of Proverbs 31. Kissing waiting until engagement, or even marriage? (Well, even Laura kissed after engagement!) For the young, with less experience in controlling sexual thoughts, okay, but not in general--any man of 30 who cannot control his lust should be in pastoral counseling. Possibly good for young people with some tips, but it seems too much of a methodology. There are women who occasionally consume strong drink or whose family life or mental health has not always been perfect; this book seems to discourage giving these young ladies a chance at happiness. This is not the only bias. I am surprised to be so liberal in my view, when I actually prefer the era when women wore a hat outside the home, but I find this book a bit out of touch with the modern man who was not home-schooled or sheltered."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife: How to find & marry a great girl","review":"My criticism would be that people with emotional problems with God's grace can still be good spouses. On the other hand, it certainly helps make the marriage easier and with a higher probability of success to marry someone who is emotionally well-adjusted!A great book to help young adults to look at themselves and their relationships so they will have healthy marriages and families."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife: How to find & marry a great girl","review":"I have been homeschooling our five children for the past fifteen years and consider this book and \\"One Minute Philosopher\\" to be the two most useful books for adulthood that my children read in high school. The ABC's, written by a well-balanced father of eight, and a former military man, examines many factors which contribute to marital stability or instability, including family finances, premarital and contraceptive sex, dealing with family dysfunction before the wedding, premarital inventories to examine compatibility, warning signs, getting parental opinions on potential mate, online dating and many other factors.Wood bases some of his advice on research and some on his experiences. He has an experienced, fatherly perspective, and cheers a couple on to get the support and necessary skills they need to have a stable, loving marriage. Although some of his opinions are not mandated by Catholic teaching, they are based on either traditional practices, such as involving the family in the process, or modern research, such as the use of a premarital questionnaire to indicate compatibility or lack of it.I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for practical Catholic advice from an experienced husband and father."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife: How to find & marry a great girl","review":"Wow, what a poor rating this book has recieved! I do not think that it is at all warranted. In fact, I have sincere suspicions that this boils down to the conservative/liberal division within The Chruch.I am a traditionalist Catholic who values the actual dogmae Ecclesiatici and deplores all this disobedience to the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, covert heresy, feminism, and communism among the human component of Holy Mother church. I pray God that we return to the Tridentine Mass as the Ordinary and Exclusive Form of the Rite and clear out the filth of heresy that has infected our seminaries.These are my qualifications and anyone who is pursuing the solid dogmae of the Fides Veritus Solus will listen. I am especially in disdain of the \\"graduate studies\\" priest who uses it as a platform for heresy and bad counsel. Millstones, my friend, beware the millstones.This book is fairly solid. Stephen Wood has a good grasp of the proper gender roles necessary to a Catholic Civilization. It's generally very good advice in line with the tradition of the Church 100%.Perhaps his book is given one star because it deplores fornication and encourages chaste courtship in a drive-thru culture of dating and deceit? Or was it his references to Scripture or the Early Church Fathers? Was it his insistance that annulments are to be avoided thorough an intelligent understanding of the Church's guidlines for a valid sacrament and not as a twisted form of \\"Catholic divorce\\"? Or is it, oh my, how he strongly recommends the Church's age-old stance against marrying anyone but a Catholic?To all of which I say, \\"God forbid that we orthodox (little o) young men should want a guide on how to marry and marry well within the Church.\\"I'm 21 by the way. And I've seen the world of unorthodoxy people like this have manufactured and am disgusted.What's more, I wish to discourage at least \\"Boy Meets Girl\\" as too Protestantum and encourage those works on courtship and marriage offered by TAN, as well as \\"Courtship and Marriage\\" by Fr. John A. O'Brien in 1949. I suggest the reader find as old a copy as well. I am afraid more recent editions may somehow change the gold which was casted in the Great Age before the Hideous Apostacy that follow the Sacred yet much-attacked (by demons during its gathering) Vatican II Pastoral Council.I believe what I have written here to be sufficient."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife: How to find & marry a great girl","review":"This is the worst dating book ever for catholics.

In all my graduate level studies and pastoral training, I have never before heard such unsound advice as is given in \\"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Wife.\\" The book runs contrary to Christian love, acceptance, and tolerance that we should have for one another.It is degrading to women to say they have no place in the career field and should only be at-home moms raising babies. Both the husband and wife have to work in some families to make ends meet. There are many fine families where both husband and wife work, who live good, holy, and fulfilled lives, with well raised children with moral values.Another area of concern that this book proposes is that a couple should not marry without the permission of both sets of parents. The Church in no way requires a person to have his or her parent's permission to marry.A women's family background should not be used as a judgment on whether she would make a good wife. Many good people come from broken homes and people can and do rise above their hard situations that they face is life. God's Grace brings good out of difficult situations.This book is unsound because it proposes a mechanical(ABC)method for choosing a wife for life. Love is not mechanical and is not discerned in a multiple choose test fashion. Discernment of a relationship based in love needs to be open to all possibilities allowed be God. One has to follow his heart and the promptings of the Holy Spirit directing his heart.

Within its pages he follows in his father's path, collecting and attempting to understand the creeds, mottoes and pledges that have shaped the United States. Burrell's book starts with the Golden Rule, and notes how it has been mentioned by all major religions, and mentioned by those with none. He also discusses oaths, the Pledge of Allegiance, family mottoes, and even words carved in stone upon our public buildings.With such diverse sources Burrell has quite a task, and attempts to categorize the various sayings, creeds, calls, and business codes of ethics into a coherent package. For the most part he is successful, although there is some redundancy in the text. But for those of us who enjoy ethics, and who wish to understand what motivates people to perform at their best, this book is a rare and interesting resource. Where else could you find The Hippocratic Oath, The Declaration of Principles of the Pacific Ice Cream Manufacturer's Association, AND the text carved upon the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier?The book is well footnoted, and contains valuable pictures of some monuments or other visual sources discussed. It can be read from cover-to-cover, or enjoyed as a casual pick-up book. With such a expansive document, some items are omitted, and sometimes more detail would be appreciated. For instance, it would have been interesting if he had discussed more how monuments can distort words or events. Nevertheless, this book will provide those interested in ethical standards and guiding principles embedded within society a terrific and valuable reference. It is a pleasure to recommend this book."},{"Title":"The WORDS WE LIVE BY","review":"Mr. Burrell hit on an interesting idea for a book: a compilation of just about every well-known motto, oath, pledge, et al., an historian could think of all cast under the rubrics of &quot;Words We Live By.&quot; However, the book, though for the most part a good read, is flawed because of its omissions. The author, Burrell, for some odd reason left out one of the most important types of oaths ever sworn--in this case, by heads of state: the Coronation Oath. Historically, this type of oath is crucial in understanding the way in which medieval kings, though in some ways powerful, nevertheless were viewed, as per the oath, as servants of God and the people. &quot;Under God&quot; meant that the king had to observe Christian ethics and common law, including a just rule over the monarch's people. This became the forerunner of the notion under democracy that rulers are servants of the people, that no law stands higher than that of God and/or the constitution. Were it not for the coronation oath and feudal oaths as well, it is doubtful that Western mankind would have provided the fundamentals of democracy. The author also omitted any of the several types of pledges and oaths sworn at various levels in totalitarian states. Since Lenin's Russia was the first such state and regarded as a model to be followed by subsequent totalitarian states (Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany), it stands to reason that it would have been appropriate to include such words that those systems &quot;lived by&quot;! Instead, the author uses up space with a good deal of redundant preaching against such unseemly characters as, say, Sen. Joseph McCarthy. There is, in fact, an aura of political correctness hovering over Burrell's book but this is largely compensated for by the inclusion of much interesting, straight-quoted material in Part 2 of his book, where the original-source quotes are located. In the next edition, if there is one, the author would be advised to take some of the above criticism seriously."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens, (American statesmen)","review":"This is an excellent biography of Thaddeus Stevens, who is most remembered for his criticism of Reconstruction efforts following the Civil War. This book, written just a few decades after he died, indicates how he has viewed in his era than more current biographies do. Further, this is a complete description of his entire life. Readers see how his energy and unwillingness to compromise were lifelong traits.Thaddeus Stevens hailed from Vermont and first practiced law in Gettysburg. Being close to the Mason-Dixon line, he saw the injustices of runaway slaves crossing into Pennsylvania whose masters wished them returned. Stevens developed a notable legal career defending runaway slaves, even paying for their freedoms himself when he lost the case.Interestingly, it would be hatred that would drive Thaddeus Stevens into politics. His distrust of Masons led him to the Anti-Mason party and into election to the Pennsylvania legislature. While he worked hard on unsuccessful efforts to remove Masons from various aspects of juries and judges in cases involving other Masons, his greatest achievements were in education. His skillful orations convinced legislators to increase funds for schools. He defense of free public education is what he considered his greatest political achievement.Stevens had a proposal that played an important role in the Civil War. He offered legislation that declared that none of the Southern cities remained as ports of entry. Although Lincoln was slow to agree to this idea, it has a key role in slowing the economies of the Southern states. A blockade by Northern states could have been challenged by foreign nations. Yet, a foreign nation that attempted to enter a port not recognzied by a host country would have committed an act of war under international law.Stevens was uncompromising, and he objected to President Johnson's efforts at Reconstruction. Stevens was a leader in the drive to impeach and the failed attempt to oust Andrew Johnson from the Presidency. This was his last major effort, and he passed away in 1868.This is a lucid and interesting book about Thaddeus Stevens. By learning more about the life of Stevens before the Civil War, we learn how his actions were a continuation of a life's previous efforts. People interested in the legislative aspects of the Civil War and Reconstruction as well as 19th century Pennsylvania politics will find this a most useful book."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"... in just one century! There's little doubt in my reading mind that Benjamin Franklin Wedekind (conceived in San Francisco, born in Germany, miseducated in Switzerland) meant to shock the socks off the bourgeois public when he wrote 'Fr&uuml;hlings Erwachen' in 1891. It's a play about teenagers -- yes, Virginia, there were teenagers in 1891 -- doing things that even adults couldn't do on a conventional stage; there are explicit scenes of rape, suicide, homos*xuality, and mast*rbation. One teenage girl is a debauched artists' model, and a childish playmate! One 14-year-old girl is beaten and abused by her father, and another envies her for it. The latter pesters her mother for the 'secrets of reproduction', finds herself incomprehensibly pregnant after the rape, and dies in an ab*rtion.\\"Spring Awakening\\" was first staged in Germany in 1906, in a heavily censored version. It played in New York for one day in 1917 but was condemned as obscenity. I wonder, would an audience in 2009 find this play horribly shocking, or would we smugly guffaw at the 19th Century moralities that it mocks. I have a feeling that the world has been so thoroughly Wedekinderized since 1891 that we'd need real blood and nudity on stage to be sufficiently shaken up. When the central character, the boy Melchior, is sent to the reformatory, for instance, he joins a circle of boys competing for a coin by trying to be the first to spurt s*men on it. That might startle even a New York audience toughened up by David Mamet.Gnarly stuff, eh? Nevertheless, Wedekind meant his play to be uproariously funny, and it is. The scenes in which the adults - parents and teachers - reveal their utter hapless in consequentiality are fresh and witty still. The unexpected appearance of a ghost, the boy Moritz who'd blown his head off, in the final scene is a brilliant absurdity. This translation, by Jonathan Franzen, seems to me to catch the sardonic tone of Wedekind's original German very effectively. Even if you may never see a decent production of Spring Awakening, it's well worth reading, as the first vernal flower of the modern theater.There is another listing on amazon of exactly the same book, available for a normal price."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"This plays reveals a common theme at the time, the enslavement of young people in Germany within their boarding schools. T&ouml;rless is the most famous victim of this environment. But here we are dealing with Moritz and Melchior, proving that M&M;'s is not the best of medicine in life. This total control of the young people's life that has only one objective, to study, to learn Latin and translate Greek, goes along with an absolute desexualization of their psyche in the name of an extreme puritan vision of ethics and life. This causes a depressive existential vision in these teenagers who look for some satisfaction anyway they can, some erotic information and literature, some friendship among themselves as a surrogate of the love they need and are deprived of, even banging up the first girl they find on their road and who knows nothing about love or rather intercourse. This produces a drama, of course. One fourteen year old boy, Moritz, commits suicide in his boarding school that expels his best friend, Melchior, who had passed some information about the physical activities they are all dreaming of, and had impregnated a certain Wendla who will die of an overdose of an abortive drug given to her by her own mother. This sexual information is considered as the unethical trigger of the suicide. Melchior's family then decides to send him to a house of correction where he discovers real evil and convinces himself he is the most guilty human being in the world. He is then tempted by crime or, because of some remnant of ethics, by suicide to put away his good for nothing person. This dilemma is set up on the stage after Melchior's escape from the house of correction in the last scenes in the graveyard where the suicidee Moritz is buried. Melchior is thus, then and there tempted to join his departed friend Moritz who is reaching out for him. But life is stronger and it comes embodied in an unidentified man who steps in and explains to Melchior that life is a long road that can provide all kinds of surprises that death cannot. This play is the matrix of many other plays and films, the most famous film being the Dead Poets' Society. But this play recently found in France its perfect illustration and re-enactment in French teenagers' prisons with several suicides resulting from total negligence if not unethical mistakes from the personnel who considered - and probably still considers - speaking of suicide was some kind of blackmail from the kids, even if they were depressive which was another way of blackmailing the personnel, wasn't it, and some kind of humorous joke to be used as a torturing device by the personnel to satisfy their sadistic and revengeful perversion onto the kids they are supposed to educate to some fair social life. Nothing has changed under the sun, or under the moon as for that. Not even the fate of young people when their society forgets they are human, forgets it takes a whole village to educate one young child, forgets they have to love people if they want to really educate and reform them. But love is the only thing thatis not available in the pedagogical and \\"professional\\" minds of these people who are called prison wardens and other personnel.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"I heard Franzen speak about how unfaithful the recent NY production was to Wedekind's anarchistic perspective. This is a brash and funny send up of modern society's sexual hypocrisy. Fast read, too."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"Jonathan Franzen's translation of the Frank Wedekind play, SPRING AWAKENING, will give you an honest taste of what the playwright truly wrote so many years ago. Opinions of it will probably be influenced by each reader's history. Are you reading it after seeing the play? Are you reading it after seeing the musical? Are you reading it -- as I did -- without having seen any stage production? I picked it up due to all the hype in the press about the recent productions -- both musical and straight up.In the introduction to this edition, Franzen is extremely critical of the musical and the liberties taken with Wedekind's work. I'm not surprised, however. Although the play does include stage directions, many scenes seem a bit confusing. For instance, when Melchior rapes Martha in the hayloft, readers of this play would never know it -- at least initially. All we get is Martha saying \\"Oh -- oh -- oh!\\" repeatedly (sounding somewhat like an old Dick and Jane primer from way back).So yes, all those teen topics are here, just in early 20th century muted tones. If you know the play already, it'll all make perfect sense. If not, act like a director and direct your imaginary actors as you read. It will make up for any gaps and give the comic lines some extra pizazz. Apparently, \\"director discretion\\" is the thing with this interesting play."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"I read the whole play in one day. It isn't quite as good as the musical, but anyone who likes the music will enjoy the play as well."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"Spring awakening explores the sexual awakening of teenage boys and girls in Germany in the late 1800's. It was shocking in its day, and still is somewhat today, despite the openness of our society.The Frank Wedekind play has been updated, set to music, and will open as a major Broadway Musical in Spring, 2003. Watch for it, you will be blown away! And be sure to read the play first. You'll be amazed at how true the production is to Frank Wedekind's fine work."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"Hughes' translation seems as rich, exciting &amp; electric to modern readers as the original text must have been to audiences a century ago. It avoids the stiff awkwardness that former English translations have been known for, while still remaining true to Wedekind's dark symbolism and expressionistic overtones. A must-read for theater-lovers and practictioners alike."},{"Title":"Spring Awakening","review":"as an actor I have just performed this play I was Mechior one of the lead roles this book has a mixture of teenage experiences, a must read for all directors and actors if you ever get a chance to perform it then make sure you do"},{"Title":"Rainbow's End","review":"There are just too many things wrong with this novel for it to get any positive recommendation. The dialogue is wooden, sometimes laughable. Coincidences and cliches abound in amateurish fashion. Spelling, grammar and syntax cry out for a competent editor.Characterizations are stiff, one dimensional, nonsensical. Among the Confederate pirates, for example, is a French Canadian who calls people, \\"Mon ami,\\" and even says \\"Sacre bleu.\\" Why he is there makes no sense at all. He seems to have walked in out of a Bullwinkle cartoon.But worst of all is the shallow understanding of history, of fact, of reality. Granted, a fiction writer can take certain liberties with raw history, but the author of this novel goes off the edge. These errors go from major points to tiny details. The Lake Erie piracy of 1864, as described in this book, does not remotely resemble, for example, what actually occurred. The \\"battle,\\" such as it was, took place on Middle Bass Island, not South Bass. John Brown, Jr. had no escaped slaves working for him, and it was he who went to warn officials at Johnson's Island prison, not a former slave. Co. K, 130th OVI boys captured were in mufti and had not been sent to Put-in-Bay. They were on the \\"Island Queen,\\" bound for Toledo to be mustered out after 100 days service. The \\"Island Queen,\\" so important to the story, was omitted completely. Rowing a boat from Put-in-Bay to Johnson's Island would have taken many hours, not minutes as the novel implies. It took John Brown, Jr. at least 12 hours to make the journey.Among the tiny details: the CSA never issued coins; the Perry Monument at Put-in-Bay is NOT the second tallest monument in the U.S.--at least 3 others are taller; the number of guns on USS MICHIGAN is wrong. The names of the \\"pirates\\" are incorrect. Nitpicking? Ah, but the devil is in the details, as the lawyers say.Pehaps if one were not aware of the history and had never been to Put-in-Bay, some of this wouldn't matter. But the glaring errors of the craft of writing would still remain. Misspelling is still misspelling. Alas, carelessness is the fatal flaw in any endeavor, writing included."},{"Title":"Rainbow's End","review":"I found this book while I was looking for a book of the same title about the stock market crash of 1929.

Now I notice that almost all the previous reviews are from Ohio and likely friends and family of the author. If my brother or good friend had written this, I'd be polite and say nice things too.

By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations."},{"Title":"Rainbow's End","review":"I read the hype and heard the author's own words praising this book.

The reader must wade through paragraphs of opinionated comments, distracting (and often incorrect) pontifications and complaints. For example, hardware designers are roundly chastized for failing to support Multics-style protection-ring logic in today's microprocessors.The text is heavily sprikled with superlatives such as 'explosive', 'incredible', 'astonishing', etc. It is irritating from a reader's perspective to be digging out good technical material betweeen snippets of pro-Informix marketing hype.When not engaged in hype, the authors sometimes make curious and possibly false assertions. In one instance, they claim that Wal-Mart's huge data warehouse is utilized to 'rotate stock'. My uninformed suspicion is that they use it for much more than that.Be prepared to read strange statements such as: &quot;IBM is a hardware vendor - but they also happen to offer a relational database product&quot;.Despite these destractingly spurious comments, I would recommend this text as good reading for those wishing to know more about object relational DBMS architectures."},{"Title":"Object Relational Dbms: Tracking the Next Great Wave (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"I am reviewing the 1st edition.Dr. Stonebraker is a pioneer in the field of object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS). He writes with confidence and clarity; he knows the subject matter because he was one of the early innovators. The book is mercifully short and to-the-point. It is well organized, and it includes an index, references, short code samples, and plenty of diagrams.The book assumes you have some background and experience with existing relational database management systems and SQL. It would also help if you have some basic understanding of implementation details like B-tree indexes and cost-based query optimizers. You should also have an understanding of OO concepts like inheritance and polymorphism, and some experience with an OO language like C++, Eiffel, Java, or Smalltalk.Armed with this background, the book is an excellent overview of the motivation, architecture, design, and features of ORDBMS. I especially liked the chapters on SQL parsing and query optimization, and also the discussions of how inheritance affects query and trigger processing.If you've never been exposed to the ideas and concepts of \\"object-relational,\\" this is an excellent starting point. If you have the background described above, you will be able to read this book in a few sittings and come away with a basic - albeit incomplete - understanding of the field of ORDBMS.I say \\"incomplete,\\" because Dr. Stonebraker fails to write about the dark side of ORDBMS. For example, once pointer-like references are introduced, the system runs the risk of 'dangling pointers'- precisely the kind thing a purely relational system elegantly avoids. This issue is never once mentioned, and yet I know for a fact it is a danger that must be dealt with on one commercial implementation I have used. There are other issues to be confronted and understood. C.J. Date has written extensively on the subject. Although C.J. Date's writing is sometimes long-winded and pedantic, you won't truly understand the ORDBMS topic until you've read what he has to say.The book is also a compelling marketing promotion for the product once sold by Stonebraker's now-defunct company. Given the \\"feature matrices\\" and other comparisons in the text, it is clear that his product was the hands-down winner at the time the book was written. This is all ancient history, however. The book shows its age and bias. First of all, Stonebraker's company Illustra (later renamed Informix) was recently acquired by IBM. Secondly, very little is said about Oracle, which has since implemented a very respectable OR system of its own. Lastly, most of the other vendors he mentioned have fallen completely off the radar map. These days, all the database vendors have most of their attention turned towards XML and raw OLTP throughput. So it seems like \\"The Next Great Wave\\" predicted by Stonebraker never fully materialized. Perhaps the 2nd edition of the book has updated the vendor list and features matrices.I wish more was said about his early work on the \\"POSTGRES\\" system. If you're interested, you can find out much more about POSTGRES and its open-source offspring, PostgresSql, by using any Internet query engine. There is now a whole cottage publishing industry built up around PostgresSql. If you want to experiment and explore ORDBMS, PostgresSql may be a good choice.Based on what I can see in the table of contents, the 2nd edition doesn't include too much new material. Dr. Stonebraker has added a chapter on application servers. I know from his other work that he argues that middle-tier application servers are wrong-headed, because business logic should reside in the database itself - where it is physically close to the data.I rate the 1st edition of the book 3 stars because (1) It is dated (2) No space is allotted to the problematic issues of ORDBMS (3) \\"The Next Great Wave\\" never seemed to take off as predicted.Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile and useful book to read if you are interested in the topic. The 2nd edition will surely have an up-to-date comparison of the ORDBMS vendors as of 1999."},{"Title":"Object Relational Dbms: Tracking the Next Great Wave (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"The book describes in great detail all of the technology that surrounds the object relational approach.

It has been prodigiously researched and offers a detailed picture of political life/activity in Hong Kong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dr. Ho Kai never practiced medicine but instead went into law. The Alice Memorial Hospital in HK is named for his first wife, an Englishwoman. Given the times in which Dr. Kai Ho Kai lived, when HK was a British colony,when there were clear class and racial distinctions, I wish the author had explored more fully--if that were possible--the feelings of his subject. His interracial marriage in itself was unique. On the mainland China was attempting to regain sovereignty over its own affairs.

Water often proved to be the hardest to express its formless self.This book discussed in details the interpretation of water features using the different media like oil, pastel, water colour. All along, it had been thought that watercolour produces the best details with depth. But the book shows that other media can achieve similar effects as well.Many examples are discussed in step-by-step approach and illuatsated in sequences to teach about the built-up, so it's a simplified step to learning.

The reference material isn't very well formatted, and it can be somewhat difficult to find what I am looking for. Nonetheless. I highly recommend this book as a tool to learn the JSTL."},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","review":"Good programming books are not rampant. Manning tends to be a great source, however. They've done it again with this book. And, this time, they have the added attraction of a great, adult sense of humour with Shawn Bayern.

I sailed through this book wondering how 400 plus pages could seem like 90 pages. The best thing is that there is a forest for the trees to live in throughout this book. Bayern is a great teacher.

JSTL is a hot topic these days, especially when it comes to Struts and other JSP Frameworks. Shawn presents an excellent description of JSTL and it's abilities, and stresses how easy it's evaluation language is to use.As a Struts programmer and architect, This book allowed me to see how many of the Struts-tags overlap with the JSTL, and I believe Shawn's work gave me the inspiration and critical knowledge I need to implement JSTL in my future projects. He treats JSTL tags as what they are -- more tools in my toolbox, not a reason to dump what I already know.A note to developers - Be careful with JSTL if you have concerns about MVC architecture, because JSTL crosses the line in a couple of places (sql and xml tags). Shawn addresses this quite well in his book.If you're reading this review, you're probably familiar with, or already programming Struts. This book will most definitely help you stay ahead of the curve and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","review":"Most of the time I don't bother reading books on bleeding edge technology, but I bought this book for several reasons. One, the book is well written with examples. Two, reading the book is much easier than reading the specifications from Sun. Three, it's a good reference book. Having read the servlet and jsp specs from servlet 1 &amp; jsp .9 to the current versions, interpretting the specification can be a challenge. Those who are interested in JSTL and need an environment that is friendly to web designers/HTML coders should consider this book.I used to have a small collection of tech books that were poorly written and useless, but JSTL isn't in that category. The book has already proved it's worth and saved time and needless head scratching."},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","review":"ReviewOne way to develop dynamic page content on a web application is to use JavaServer Pages technology. This allows you to embed bits of Java code, or scriptlets, within the HTML page. The web server interprets the scriptlet when the page is called and produces the content that is coded. This is all good, but there are common tasks (such as looping) that each developer had to reinvent from scratch each time it was used in a page. To prevent this repetitive coding, a common set of JSP tags were created to allow developers to concentrate on business logic instead of coding structures. This creation is known as the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL). That's what this book is all about...The book starts with an examination of how JSP and XML tags come together to form the basis of JSTL. This is followed by a number of chapters that cover the different tags that are used to control branching, flow, text formatting, and other various structures. After the basics of JSTL, the author looks at a number of common tasks encountered by JSP developers and how they would be coded using JSTL. Finally, the book wraps up with reference data needed on a regular basis as you use JSTL, such as the API.The writing is clear and concise, with an abundance of diagrams and code to illustrate the points. The mix of reference, tutorial, and practical examples is perfect, and every developer will be able to use this book in a number of situations.Websphere developers (both web application and portlet development) will get the most out of this book when it comes to the IBM/Lotus world. The use of JSTL will reduce the code complexity of your JSP pages and speed up your development efforts.ConclusionIf you are developing JSP pages and haven't looked into the use of the JSTL area, get this book. It will save you time and effort in your coding, and you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","review":"While the technical specification of JSTL is readable like most hi-tech documents are &quot;readable&quot; (i.e. it left me sometimes a bit puzzled), this book is both deep and full of very useful examples. Sometimes, in my opinion it goes too far (programming a message board with JSTL), but this only goes to show how powerful JSTL really is.Overall, I really enjoyed reading it: It made a lot of things clearer and there were a couple of times where I thought: &quot;Oh, I didn't know that JSTL could do that!&quot;."},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","review":"I have purchased two JSTL books, and this was the best one by far. It is very practical and relevant for day-to-day development work. I'm suprised at how many times I consult it. My only complaints are that 1. the book is a little dry and 2. I would have liked just a little more conceptual framework to hang all the facts on.Still, this book is extremely useful and does what it says it would do."},{"Title":"JSTL in Action","review":"The thing I really liked about the book was lots of examples, that clearly explain the concepts and usage of JSTL.

It has an excellent reference section, and the body of the book explains how to use the JSTL tags with many good example. On the whole, a very useful, readable book.

But with all the hype - or lack thereof - surrounding the bombed Disney movie, I decided to read the book before the movie comes out on DVD. Yeah, it's a little silly, but it's still a fun ride all the way. I enjoyed the nonstop action, John Carter's superhuman strength, his gentlemanliness (is that a word?) and his ability to bridge culture gaps and help the locals overcome traditions of hatred and prejudice. He is a southern gentleman to the core. It shows in everything he does, particularly in his absence of lust for the beautiful princess Dejah Thoris though she is buck naked and gorgeous. He adores her totally and completely and treats her like the royal lady she is the whole time."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This Library of American edition of A Princess of Mars is a beautiful book! It's about time Edgar Rice Burroughs, one of the USA's bestselling authors for about 20-25 years starting in 1914, had one of his books published by the Library of America. LOA has also published Tarzan of the Apes.I have the 1st edition of A Princess of Mars, by McClurg, and this Library of America edition is close (but not quite) a fascsimile 1st edition. All five of the original illustrations are present, but they are not on \\"coated\\" paper like they are in the original 1st edition. The dust jacket is beautiful.I short, if you're looking for a very nice edition of this book, buy this one!Before closing, note that I also give the story itself 5 Stars! And the second and third books of the trilogy, The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, are equally as good!Read ERB's Barsoom series for a thrill!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Loving the book, but, I did not purchase it as it is in the public domain for anyone with an ereader or web browser.

I suppose you can buy it here if you must read a paper version."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this, but was pleasently surprised how much I enjoyed it. From the action scenes to the landscapes of Mars, the authur does a great job of paining a picture with his words. This is so much better than the movie, so if you were interested in the movie in anyway, you need to read this book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"If you like thrillers and are willing to accept unbelievable scenarios and beings, then you don't need to look any further than this. Edgar Rice Burroughs didn't just invent Tarzan, he was a pioneer of modern science fiction. This is an epic about John Carter, who gets transported to Mars and then gets involved in saving a beautiful princess, complete with Martian sidekicks and against really nasty villains. This is romance, action, adventure, and drama all wrapped up together in a way that you can't get away with it in the real world. Great book for anyone."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Had not a clue why I chose this from one of the kindle freebies. a bit of a tough read the style is akin to war and peace. Then I realized it was written in 1917. One day one of my work mates was discussing a date and a strange science fiction movie they saw. I saw a preview and that sparked further motivation and understanding of this book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I had read this book for the first time back in the 1970s. I can understand why ERB should be considered the father of American Science Fiction after reading \\"A Princess of Mars.\\" I was so enamored by this book back then that I could hardly wait to purchase and read the remaining books in the series. It is unfortunate, that there weren't more books in the series. Personally, I believe these stories were more interesting and better written than Burroughs' Tarzan series.The introduction of \\"A Princess of Mars\\" opens after the death and strange burial request of John Carter. It proceeds with Edgar Rice Burroughs fulfilling \\"Uncle Jack's\\" request concerning a strange manuscript that has been left to him. The first few chapters of the book explain what John Carter did immediately after The War Between the States and his first death on Earth. It proceeds to his arrival on Mars, Barsoom to the natives, and continues with the story of his first six months on Mars and ends with his saving of the home of his \\"incomparable Princess\\" Dejah Thoris\\". All in all, I have been mesmerized by this story ever since I first read it.For those of you that may have watched the \\"John Carter\\" movie, the plot here is only slightly the same. For example, in the book, Tars Tarkas is a Jed, not the Jeddak, of the Tharks. There are numerous other differences that you should read about so that you will understand most of the disdain fans of the John Carter series of books hold for the movie."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs is an excellent author. He develops the characters so well they almost feel like your next door neighbor and his imagination is staggering especially when you realize he wrote this book in 1917. He incorporates the airplane, weaponry of the time and makes it fantastical. A very good read"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a great read. The story is timeless as evidenced by how many of what 2012's audiences would consider as \\"classics\\" in the sci-fi realm (i.e. Star Wars, Avatar, Flash Gordon) borrow heavily from this plot line. Some critics have downplayed this novel as being nothing new. But for a novel from 1912 - it is the original to which all the others owe their world attraction. And it still holds up well on its own even after 100 years! So what are the downside issues with the book? Well, the method of transport between Earth and Mars was not well developed, but is still forgivable. Of more concern is the nearly sudden ending. The plan of action for the book's hero, as he strives to solve the final challenge, was obvious to the reader well before the thought even entered the head of our protagonist. This ended up being very frustrating; the reader left feeling that valuable time was lost. Time which could have changed the outcome of the book's story to one that was more satisfying. That said, the earlier claim that it is a great read is still valid. The story was exciting and the classical rendering and author's choice of words were what made it an enjoyable experience as well as an educational one. Keep your dictionaries nearby and prepare to be entertained by Tarzan's author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, as he chronicles the story of love gained and lost in an extraterrestrial locale."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a classic example of the pulp literature genre. The author knows his audience and gives them what they want. It is sci-fi fantasy with a superhuman hero, gorgeous heroine, and cliff hanger action. This book doesn't try to be great literature, but it is a great example of this type of literature. It is basically a modern graphic novel without the graphic part."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Where to begin? This story is amazing! Captivating, enchanting, and utterly engrossing. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. Ok, maybe it helped that I was on a plane for the first 75% of the book, but still, I would've easily fallen asleep had it been boring. John Carter is our valiant hero who is transported to Mars and finds himself with astonishing strength and agility, neither of which can save him from capture by hostile Martians, but both of which help him survive his captivity. The classic story of a hero, his unusual sidekicks, and the beautiful damsel in distress. From the development of the different cultures and races on Mars to the explanation of how they survive the atmosphere, the story was plausible, albeit whimsical. Usually when I read sci-fi, it seems contrived and all-too-convenient, but this book is well-planned and masterfully told. It's free - read it; there's a reason it's a classic.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This an amazing story in a great format! The book for which the recent movie ' John Carter' by Walt Disney was based. A must read for anyone who enjoys a good adventure."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs will always be best known as the creator of Tarzan. Though not as well known, another of his creations, John Carter of Mars, is probably as compelling a character. A Princess of Mars (1912) is the first of eleven books in Burroughs Martian series. At under two hundred pages, it's a tight, quick read with action on nearly every page. John Carter is a civil war soldier transported to Mars where he immediately finds more than a handful of trouble and action (not to mention, a beautiful princess in need of rescue). The writing is straightforward pulp at its best. Carter isn't a deeply flawed character as we might see today. He's more of the classic hero. I'm not sure if even Kryptonite could harm him, but due to the lesser gravity of Mars, he is able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Aside from this, I find it exciting how well a century-old science fiction novel can hold up, given the unprecedented technological and societal changes which have taken place in the time since its conception. That the story doesn't feel so dated as to be dismissed outright says a lot about Burroughs' skill as a writer. The Martian culture painted here is rich and true. The characters breathe. The history of the civilization is believable and well thought out. Very rarely did I find myself pulled from the reality of the tale by elements that seemed dated or unreal to a twenty-first century reader. Burroughs even envisioned a GPS (Global Positioning System) with direction-finding capabilities. He called the thing a compass, but hey, we still call those contraptions we carry around phones, even though they do three times as much as a Star Trek tricorder. This is an excellent read and if you're looking for a good old-fashioned sci-fi romp, well worth the time."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I found the writing exciting and vibrant just like any other works by Edgar Rice Burroughs, I can see why George Lucas got his inspiration for Star Wars from this book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I had little interest in the stories written of Mars by Mr. Burroughs until the John Carter movie peaked my interest.The story is more science-fantasy than sci-fi, so if you can't get past the known science of Mars, I'd suggest a different book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"It's an interesting story, and he describes the martian flora and fauna very well, but there are some things that are glossed over (like what happened in the cave) and the only character that is explored with any depth is Jon Carter."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This story (along with the others in this series) is very entertaining and fast moving. I found it hard to put it down."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I originally read these books in my early teens. It is an escapist guilty pleasure to revisit them in my 50's. Campy, but classic. I'd highly recommend for anyone who enjoys sci-fi/adventure tails."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I reread this book recently after approximately 20 years, although it has crossed my mind many times since then. I saw the movie (which wasn't very good) and wanted to compare it with my memory of the first book of this series. Of course, the book is far superior to the movie in every aspect. (The movie couldn't even get the costumes right--the characters in the book are naked! Well, I guess that would have been a problem with the PG-13 rating...) If you saw the movie and were disappointed in it, check out the book; it's as good today as it was when I was an innocent and unjaded high schooler."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Love the style and writing of Burroughs. A return to the books I read as a child and young adult in the backwood communities and tourist meccas of Northern Canada.

Hard to read at first with a cumbersome style of language but as you get into it, the story comes alive with great imagination, character development, emotional development, suspense, romance, action, culture, technology and everything else you want in a good book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When I was eight or nine, my mother saw me reading \\"Princess of Mars,\\" and removed it from my eager grasp, stating \\"You don't need to be reading that. It is just a trashy book.\\" Well of course, that piqued my interest even more and when I saw the book among some other discarded items in the garage, I read it in bits and pieces whenever I could steal out to the garage and read a few paragraphs. I am not sure, at this late date (that was 64 years ago) whether I finished the book or not, but I clearly recall that it was magical and engrossing to my prepubescent brain and ranked right up there with my Big Little book of \\"Pinocchio\\" and my wonderful \\"Dr. Doolittle\\" stories.Inspired by the release of the new movie, \\"John Carter,\\" I took up \\"Princess of Mars\\" again and read it through on my recently obtained Kindle. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book and for a few priceless hours, it rekindled (yes, pun intended) my sense of wonder and delight in the fantasy that Edgar Rice Burroughs so skillfully fashioned. Yes it is a fantasy, not science fiction as others have said. There is little science in \\"Princess of Mars.\\" It could have been set in Atlantis or Mu or a world named from Burroughs imagination but Mars was a perfect choice because coeval writings of astronomers such as Percival Lowell and Schiaparelli spoke of canals on Mars and it was supposed where there were canals, there must be intelligent canal builders. There was lots of speculation on what the canal builders might be and many thought they were surely humans like us.It is a shame that the canal builders, and the canals they supposedly built never existed. But Burroughs imagined world is marvelous. And you will love the characters: John Carter of Virginia, Dejah Thoris, Tars Tarkas and all the denizens of Mars, or Barsoom as the natives call their planet. I can close my eyes and see them now. If you still retain your sense of wonder or would like to bring it back to life, don't miss reading \\"Princess of Mars.\\""},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Context. Barsoom hit the big screen yesterday, the results of which I can't yet comment upon. However, I can say that months ago when the ads began to appear, it renewed my childhood curiosity of the Boris Vallejo and Frank Frazetta covered paperbacks. As an early teen, I dismissed these adventures, unread, as something that surely couldn't be worth a read. Not much has really changed between then and now, except maybe that the public domain copy of Princess was available for free download. My speculative and hesitant foray soon become one of an increasing, if guilty, pleasure. Having finished, I'm not embarrassed to report that I had a fantastic time on Mars with John Carter. This tale is one of limited organization and pure adventure. Think back to sitting in a tree-house with comic books, and exchanging with friends the speculations of aliens, monsters, war, etc. and the elaborate weavings in and out of logic that so captivated you then. Burroughs took me back to that place, and I greatly appreciated and needed the visit. Want to escape for a few hours, I think this is a good place to try. Want to engage in philosophical debate about Burroughs' place in the pantheon of great writers, sure, why not, this won't hurt. If you are a dedicated hater of fun and have no time for frivolity, look elsewhere... I'm giving this book four stars, because if you're considering buying it, you are probably not the type that looks down on this type of fiction and will enjoy it, or, even better, you're the type that reads everything with great intensity, and like me, are curious to see why something apparently so silly, has stood what appears to be, a test of time greater than most."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When Edgar Rice Burroughs began writing his Barsoom series, people didn't know a lot about Mars except that it seemed to have canals.So Burroughs came up with his own elaborate fantasy world, populated by green barbarians, airships, multi-legged beasts and giant hairy white apes. Buttkicking ex-soldier John Carter is a bit of a Gary Stu, but at least he's a pleasant one -- and Burroughs fleshes out his imaginary Mars with loving skill, coming up with alien fauna and cultures that really resemble nothing on Earth.During an Apache attack, ex-Confederate soldier John Carter takes shelter in a cave... and wakes on a strange alien world. He soon discovers that he's somehow been transported to the planet Mars (or Barsoom), and is apprehended by the barbaric green Martians of Thark, who do not understand love or friendship. But thanks to gravity and his own skills, John Carter is able to gain the respect of the Tharks, and even becomes a chieftain.But the Tharks capture Dejah Thoris, a princess of the more humanlike red Martians. John Carter soon falls in love with her. As their safety is threatened by a small conspiracy of extra-cruel Tharks, Carter starts plotting to escape to the Red Martian city of Helium. But escape turns out to be the least of his problems when he becomes embroiled in the complex politics of two different Martian races.While \\"A Princess of Mars\\" is a fun sci-fi adventure, the real draw here is Barsoom -- a wild, cruel world filled with fantastical beasts and colorful flora. A good chunk of the book is devoted just to showing Carter (and us) its cultures, flora, fauna, mores, mythology and a history that Burroughs clearly spent a lot of time on. It takes awhile for the plot to get revved up (seriously, it takes FOREVER for them to leave Thark), but once it does, it's quite brilliant.And Burroughs writes in a solid pulp style. He spends too much on analyzing the green Martian culture, but he also splatters the story with plenty of big acrobatic fight scenes, high-speed battles, and evocative descriptions of the wild, desertlike world of Barsoom and how very strange it is. And as he explores the ways in which the Martians are different from humans, Burroughs produces some very heartfelt, emotional moments, such as Sola telling Carter about her mother.John Carter is admittedly kind of a Gary Stu -- he's a noble soldier who is stronger and more acrobatic than anyone else on the planet, a gorgeous princess falls for him, and he instantly becomes an important figure in two different warring cultures. I should hate him.However, he's at least a LIKABLE Gary Stu, relatively humble and quick to help other people. Dejah Thoris is not fleshed out quite so well (except in the wink-wink-nudge-nudge way), but the Green Martians are surprisingly complex creatures -- they're raised to be cruel and loveless, but they are also noble and strong. Tal Tarkas and Sola are particularly well-developed characters, especially as Carter changes how they see the world.\\"A Princess of Mars\\" spends a long time exploring the world of Barsoom, before transforming into a rollicking sci-fi adventure tale. Just have the next book on hand before you finish."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When Edgar Rice Burroughs began writing his Barsoom series, people didn't know a lot about Mars except that it seemed to have canals.So Burroughs came up with his own elaborate fantasy world, populated by green barbarians, airships, multi-legged beasts and giant hairy white apes.

But thanks to gravity and his own skills, John Carter is able to gain the respect of the Tharks, and even becomes a chieftain.But the Tharks capture Dejah Thoris, a princess of the more humanlike red Martians. John Carter soon falls in love with her. As their safety is threatened by a small conspiracy of extra-cruel Tharks, Carter starts plotting to escape to the Red Martian city of Helium. But escape turns out to be the least of his problems when he becomes embroiled in the complex politics of two different Martian races.While \\"A Princess of Mars\\" is a fun sci-fi adventure, the real draw here is Barsoom -- a wild, cruel world filled with fantastical beasts and colorful flora. A good chunk of the book is devoted just to showing Carter (and us) its cultures, flora, fauna, mores, mythology and a history that Burroughs clearly spent a lot of time on. It takes awhile for the plot to get revved up (seriously, it takes FOREVER for them to leave Thark), but once it does, it's quite brilliant.And Burroughs writes in a solid pulp style. He spends too much on analyzing the green Martian culture, but he also splatters the story with plenty of big acrobatic fight scenes, high-speed battles, and evocative descriptions of the wild, desertlike world of Barsoom and how very strange it is. And as he explores the ways in which the Martians are different from humans, Burroughs produces some very heartfelt, emotional moments, such as Sola telling Carter about her mother.John Carter is admittedly kind of a Gary Stu -- he's a noble soldier who is stronger and more acrobatic than anyone else on the planet, a gorgeous princess falls for him, and he instantly becomes an important figure in two different warring cultures. I should hate him.However, he's at least a LIKABLE Gary Stu, relatively humble and quick to help other people. Dejah Thoris is not fleshed out quite so well (except in the wink-wink-nudge-nudge way), but the Green Martians are surprisingly complex creatures -- they're raised to be cruel and loveless, but they are also noble and strong. Tal Tarkas and Sola are particularly well-developed characters, especially as Carter changes how they see the world.\\"A Princess of Mars\\" spends a long time exploring the world of Barsoom, before transforming into a rollicking sci-fi adventure tale. Just have the next book on hand before you finish."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"My first question when I started reading this book was \\"How did I miss anything by this author?\\" \\"How did I skip all these classics?\\"This book left me feeling!The feeling was as that of a young girl who would read this book and dream to be the 'princess' who had a 'big bad handsome man' who loved her. I was brought back to the days when I would steal away and dream of a hero to come and rescue me.I loved the descriptive words that the author used to tell us of his love for his princess. What can I say, I am a romantic who believes chivalry is not dead![...]"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"John Carter of Mars was one of my favorite all time heroes, ranking right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, and of course Tarzan. I read it as a teenager, and recently read it again, and was again amazed by the story. Of course Burroughs didn't believe in that Mars anymore than anyone else. It was nonetheless great Romantic Science Fantasy. Red Martians,Green Martians, four armed carnivorous apes and of course Thoats, flying battleships, rifle that kill at a hundred miles, and of course sword fights. Complete nonsense if looked at rationally, but still a great story. Burroughs was criticized for too many outrageous coincidences in his stories, but that is the stuff of exciting literature. Recommend that this book be on everyone's reading list before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book was a lovely way to spend my reading time. It was a bit of a surprise that I liked it as much as I did because I usually lean more towards fantasy rather than sic-fi. My husband still remembers it well after 45 years and plans to reread it as soon as he gets a chance so we can have the fun of talking about it. Since he generally goes for more hard-core sic-fi, we don 't often get that opportunity. I've already gotten the next four books of the series and I'm anxious to find out what happens next. Unless you don't like heroes, damsels in distress, wicked villains, true friends, and lots of death-defying adventures, I recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Somehow John Carter manages to go to Mars, and when he gets there, he finds out that he is physically stronger than the warlike martians that happen to dwarf him in size. He uses that strength, and the convenient fact that the also telepathic martians can't read his mind, to dominate a clan of green martians and win a beautiful, conveniently human, princess. Then he saves the world a couple times just for kicks, all while running around naked, because no one on Mars wears clothes.The cover says it all. It was an easy read, adventurous, fun, and all the blatant inconsistencies and false information can be happily ignored because it was written in 1912 by the author of Tarzan, so keep it in perspective."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"My first time reading Burroughs. Thoroughly enjoyed this book, even with the occasional and distracting techno/biological inconsistencies...an excusable byproduct of the times. Great imaginative story with a good deal of unexpected twists. Fun, quick-paced reading that will hold your interest throughout."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"30 years ago, when I was 14, I read this book from cover to cover in a day. Action of this sort was new to me &amp; I was hooked on it. I could not get enough of John Carter &amp; his adventures and read all the books in the series. John Carter was a real hero and what boy becoming a man didn't want to be just like Carter? While browsing the local library shelves last week I found an old edition of A Princess of Mars.It was like rounding a corner and walking into your best friend you've not seen in forever.I read this book again as if it was the first time ...it was more glorious this time than 30 years ago.This book is filled with adventure,courage, action,devotion,insight &amp; is extremely well written. A Princess of Mars is a must read..as great as Tolkien's Rings &amp; Howard's Conan."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Not much for intellectual stimulation, but WOW! John Carter of Virginia is swept to Mars by, well, something, and while he doesn't get to bring any clothing, it turns out he fits in better that way. Before you know it he's sword slinging across the planet making friends and enemies and leaving behind the corpses of most of those enemies, all to save his true love, a beautiful princess and a red martian (think crayola-red), the indominable Dejah Thoris. And absolutely nobody on the planet ever wears clothing (except the yellow men - think lemon-yellow - who live in the frozen North, and THEY only wear clothing outdoors). It's non-stop action and a whole lot of fun. I only wonder what people made of it when it was published in 1912!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"The Martian Tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs get the highest marks, best reviews, they are labelled as the treshold of present day science fiction and science fantasy. Presently nobody seems to be interested in printing these fabulous stories. I wonder why ? Maybe it's because nobody has ever written stories that can be re-read over and over again, making these stories uneconomical in our present day society."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Can't beat a story that starts out West in post-Civil War and ends in Mars. John Carter looking for gold in the West with a partner, who gets killed by Indians who chase Carter to a cave that Indians refuse to go. Carter wakes up naked and facing a four armed green giant armed to the teeth and not going to show mercy to this stranger who is lurking at their nursery. The action does not slow down from there. It is Burrough's first book and one of his best. Burroughs himself, had went West to look for gold,too.Tom Bougha"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"It can never be said that Edgar Rice Burroughs lacked for imagination. Best known as the creator of Tarzan, before the King of the Apes was born ERB wrote this first adventure of John Carter, a Southern gent who emigrated to the wild west, only to find himself, by mysterious means, transported to Mars. There, John Carter finds himself amid great green, four-armed, 14-foot aliens, savage beasts, forbidding landscapes, ancient civilizations, and damsels in distress. The book is fast-paced, adventurous, and never dull. While written in a bit of an antique vocabularly, it is still wildly accessible and has lost none of its charm. John Carter is a true hero in the old selse of the word - undaunted, able, and always honorable; his enemies are nothing if not sinister, his perfect opposites. I heartily recommend this work both to fans of science fiction and fantasy, as well as those who have newly come either to the genre or to ERB himself. It will no doubt leave you thirsty for the additional installments (which are also worth reading)."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Considering the original copywrite is 1912, it is astounding to see this story still in print! The hero, John Carter, a civil war veteran finds himself suddenly transported to a very warlike Mars. Due to the lower gravity he is a bit like a swasbuckling super man. This novel is a fast paced action adventure story with an ending that will make you regret that you did not buy the second novel when you purchased the first. Young and old will enjoy this book. Considering the age of the story I found it amazing how much the author knew about the planet Mars. Of course what was not known about Mars in 1912 certainly allowed the author to be wildly inventive. This is a true classic."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I can't even begin to count the number of times I have read Burroughs' Mars series, and this is without doubt the best of them all. It has everything: swordfights, high adventure, big green Martians, ancient, highly advanced civilizations, a love story, a hero who eventually conquers the world, the most beautiful woman ever in the universe completely naked and falling in love with the most amazing hero of all, and an astounding dreamlike quality to its crisp, clear narrative that is truly enchanting. No one other than Burroughs could have written a novel like this, and I'm glad no one else did, for no one else could have achieved the sheer quality of the book as it stands. If you want a good book that truly stands out above all othersI recommend this book to you. Trust me, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This novel was a complete surprise for me. First, I saw a movie on TV called John Carter. I thought it was great. Next, I noticed it was based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs- of Tarzan fame? No way, I thought. So, when my family bought me a tablet for Christmas, I decided to look for it. At the ridiculous price of $0.00, I bought it. I am now on the third of his series of books. What is so interesting for me is that this series talks to the future in the same manner of Jules Verne or H.G. Wells. He published this first book in 1917 I believe. Flight was a very young idea back then. He deals with it in a very delightful and adventurous manner, along with other ideas that I am sure stretched the imagination. And that is the point. I was used to the idea of seeing Johnny Weissmuller swinging through the jungle belting out his Tarzan yell and summoning all his animal friends in the jungle to confront &#34;man&#34; and save the day. Here was a man transported to the planet Mars to interact with many types of beings and many forms of their beliefs. In a wonderful salute to parody, Burroughs alludes to human civilization and its beliefs and faith in those beliefs in a delicate manner. On Mars for instance, one creatures Heaven may be another creatures dinner! Read it and see.I want to add one entirely different remark. At a older age now, it is difficult for me to focus for longs periods of time on print. These tablets are something to consider. You can adjust the print size or font and the background you read it on. The Amazon Kindle Store is remarkable. When you download a book of choice it is delivered to you by &#34;Whispernet&#34;, which fantastically comes to you in less than a minute!!!! Most of these books are at reduced prices. I have a Samsung tablet, so I know the Kindle app works on it. I do really think taking a look at those Kindle Fires might be worthy of a glance. They are dedicated to this reading structure and I heard they do not make a bunch on the tablets. They are interested in making money on the Amazon platform. So, the tablets are well made for the money. I might have a look at one if mine ever goes to that &#34;heaven &#34; for tablets."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"If you are like me and found the movie greatly disappointing, there is a good reason for it. The screenwriters abandoned the book and greatly altered the hero.A Princess of Mars was Edgar Rice Burroughs first of several books featuring hero John Carter. Carter IS NOT a brooding anti-hero found in the Disney feature. Instead, he is a Civil War veteran who fought for the Confederacy. He is a good and decent man who treats others with respect. He will fight to defend the innocent, the just and the righteous. His actions are dictated by codes of honor, justice, decency and a duty to defend those who cannot defend themselves.When John Carter suddenly finds himself on Mars he is captured by the Tharks. It is here that Edgar Rice Burroughs really stands out as a writer. World building. Burroughs creates unique races with unique and complex cultures, heritages and histories that are sometimes shared and sometimes found only in one race. The detail which Burroughs employs his world building immerses the reader in the story and makes following the characters more enjoyable. The many characters, both major and minor, are well developed and three dimensional. Character histories and adherence to the Martian cultural traditions allows motives and actions of the Martian peoples to make perfect sense.Don't worry, the book is neither boring nor slow. Stretches of world building and character development are punctuated by virtuoso action scenes of intense battle and terrific bravery. Burroughs' careful choice of words and descriptions are neither grotesque nor vulgar. Instead they are exciting, heroic and epic in scale.A Princess of Mars, while not as well known as Burroughs' other creation, Tarzan, has influenced many over the years. George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron are just a few who have borrowed from this terrific series and incorporated elements into their own stories.A Princess of Mars is terrific and exciting book. John Carter was to that time period what Indiana Jones or The Avengers is to ours."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I had never read anything by ERB before this, and now he is one of my favorite classic authors. A Princess of Mars is filled with non stop action and excitement.The book begins with john carter, the main character, revealing his past. He does not know how old he is or when he was born, only that he has seen many generations of his family grow up and pass on.After trying to save a dying friend in an Arizona cave, John wakes up alone on a completely different world. It is on this strange world (mars) that he meets Deja Thorris, the martian princess whom John quickly falls in love with.This book is fun from start to finish. Any fan of classic sci fi should read this facinating book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"You want imagination?..adventure?..a few dabs of science(remember it was written in 1912)?..an ageless hero?..an absolutely beautiful damsel in distress?..a whole new world?..with a language all it's own?..inhabited with strange new creatures?.. friends and foes?..battles royal?..This book, and all 10 or 11 sequels, have it all! ER Burroughs was the early master of science fiction, adventure, and imagination; a man ahead of his time, and he gives the reader a roller-coaster ride of incredible adventures. Join with us now as John Carter meets, rescues,and captures the heart of the INCOMPARABLE Dejah Thoris, Princess of Mars!, and eventually, along with his friend Tars Tarkas, follows suit with the entire red planet, Barsoom to its wild and whacky inhabitants.Is this intellectual literature?..of course not. Is it non-stop fun and enjoyment, the original page-turner novel?...You bet it is! Pick this book up, start reading, and I guarantee: you won't put it down until you're finished!..and then you'll run out the door and be hunting for the 2nd book in the series, The Gods of Mars, and then # 3, The Warlord of Mars, and on through the series. Be warned: make sure you have access to #'s 2 and 3 before you start The Princess...you'll be sorry if you don't!I first read the Burroughs Martian novels(there were 10 known to me then) as a graduate student studying Physics, some 40 years ago. They provided the perfect escape from the rigors of courses like Quantum Mechanics and E &amp; M. Now I reread them,and I continue to enjoy. You will too."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"John Carter, Dejah Thoris, Tars Tarkas, they are all here!This is the totally unbelievable story of a man who got transported to Mars basically, because he thought it would be cool to go, so he wished it, and POOF, he's there. Then, there's the fact that the planet itself and the life on it are also completely ridiculous. FORGET ALL THAT! Read it to be swept up in one of the greatest adventure series of all time. John Carter goes to Barsoom (Mars, to the Martians) rescues the most beautiful woman in the universe and (later in the series) conquers an entire world through the power of his will and the strength of his right arm. Handsome, powerful heroes, beautiful half naked captive princesses just panting to be rescued, Villians, so evil you want to go back in time to strangle their parents, Big ugly friends, (What are you laughing at, remember Chewbacca?) strange beasts, stranger aliens, wierd science, epic battles, betrayals, great reunions. This one's got it all. The best of Burroughs' body of work, the most action packed series from the true master of the action story. Edgar Rice Burroughs is the creator of Tarzan. Don't ever pick up his work expecting an intellectual workout. Just get in and hang on for the ride"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Princess of Mars is a fantastic, wild ride. I think everyone makes a mistake though of saying it's just a guys book. I'm a woman, and it was my mother who recommended Princess to me! I think any girl who's interested in science fiction or fantasy would really enjoy this book. Yeah, it was obviously written with adolescent boys in mind but I think anyone can enjoy this wildly imaginative page turner.The characters are all extremely likable. John Carter is the perfect southern gentleman. Honorable, loyal, incredibly brave, respectful to women, extremely handsome; a perfect hero who is never boorish or conceited. Then there's Sola, one of the few green Martians to show compassion and kindness, and Tars Tarkas(aren't these names so cool?)a ferocious green martian warrior with a tragic past who is also able to feel compassion and love. And I dare anybody to tell me that they wouldn't want a Woola of their very own! Dejah Thoris though is mainly for the guys. Carter's love and devotion for her was really sweet. I didn't even know that this was part of a book series until I read it on amazon and now I am really eager to read the other books of the series. And wasn't the end cool? I don't think I've ever read an ending quite like that before. What Carter found in the cave at the end was very creepy and intriguing. (I won't give out a spoiler)Although this is pulp fiction and sort of like a comic book in a way,(I can see mothers in 1912 scolding their kids, \\"That Edgar Rice Burroughs is going to rot your mind if you keep reading it!\\") it's still light science fiction at it's best! (I'll warn you right off though, please don't expect something deep and complex like Dune or Darkover and post a review whining about it. Princess is purely for fun.) And am I the only one that thinks Princess would make a really awesome movie?"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"There's no question that \\"A Princess Of Mars\\"--the first in the eleven book series--is brilliant. In fact, the first three volumes of ERB's Mars are arguably the best.

Adventure and Romance await!--Robert Carter"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"In this--Edgar Rice Burroughs' first tale of life on Mars (Barsoom to its inhabitants)--we see a brilliantly conceived world featuring titanic green monsters and gorgeous red princesses battling forever across a dying landscape. From the opening set in the American southwest to the deserted cities on Mars to great battles between balkanized nations, this is brilliant adventure fiction. John Carter, the hero, is just standard enough in the pulp vein for readers to identify with him, even as his agelessness and ability to defy Death make him truly intriguing. Even though Dejah Thoris--the princess from whom the novel takes its title--really does very little, her beauty and intelligence are more than enough to convince any man to do as Carter does to make her love him. All this fantastic adventure in a wonderful dream-world leaves the reader panting for more after the last page has been turned. Fortunately Burroughs delivered. I can not recommend this work more highly."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is Edgar Rice Burroughs's first novel, and he obviously had some growing pains to go through first. But he got up to speed extremely quickly. &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; is imaginative, far exceeding anything else written in science-fiction before it. H. G. Welles wrote allegorical and social-commentary science-fiction, and Verne concentrated on scientific prediction. But Burroughs essentially took an old-fashioned Knight-errant story and tossed it onto Mars. The result: a fastasia of plutonium guns, sowrd fighting, flying platforms, 15 ft green aliens, and fercious four-armed white apes. Outrageous, ridiculous, and oh so much fun!But the series would get better in the later books. To fully enjoy &quot;Princess&quot;, you must also read &quot;Gods of Mars&quot;, and &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;, which complete an informal trilogy within the series. Burroughs has some difficulty structuring this first novel, and the events do not fit together as well as his later works. Escpeially in the first fifty pages, Burroughs appears to be just winging it. Also, some of the stodgy poeticisms of earlier fantasy and sci-fi haven't quite left his pen. In a few more novels, he would trim his style down even further and revolutionize popular literature. With only his next book, &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; (you've probably heard of it), he would make vast improvements in plotting and characterization.But if you want to read Edgar Rice Burroughs (and few authors are more enjoyable), there's no better place to start than the beginning, and you'll quickly forgive &quot;Princess&quot;'s faults and be able to enjoy it...and the best is yet to come!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs will always be remembered first and foremost for his creation of Tarzan, but it was the character of John Carter, who first appeared in \\"A Princess of Mars\\" who truly served as a template for other science fiction writers. From Lin Carter's \\"Green Star\\" series to John Norman's \\"Gor\\" books there are tales of the man from Earth traveling to a strange new world and having wondrous adventures. John Carter was a gentleman of Virginia who finds himself looking at his dying body in an Arizona cave. Opening his arms to the planet Mars, Carter is suddenly whisked to the Red Planet, where rival tribes battle while the planet's atmosphere continues to dissipate. Captured by a band of six-limbed giants, Carter soon earns their respect for his prowess as a warrior and forges a lasting friendship with Tars Tara&#8217;s of the Tharks. But then the Tharks attack a fleet of airborne vessels and capture Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, the greatest city on Barsoom (as the Martians call Mars). Of course, they get off on the wrong foot, since Carter knows nothing about the culture of the red humanoid race. But the lovely Princess of Mars has captured the Virginian's heart. Abandoning dreams of returning to Earth, he wants nothing better than to win her love. In the meanwhile, he has to protect her from the amorous attention of the depraved ruler of the Tharks, bring some semblance of civilization to the barbarian tribes, and stop all out war between the green men and red men from ending Barsoom's last chance for survival.\\"A Princess of Mars\\" is the first of eleven novels in Burroughs' Martian Series, which seemed to avoid the pitfalls of some of ERB's lesser Tarzan novels. If Dejah Thoris is not the most beautiful woman in the history of fantasy and science fiction, then she certainly has the all-time best name. John Carter is able to take advantage of the Red Planet's lesser gravity to do great feats of leaping about, but it is his innate intelligence and intense sense of personal honor that make him almost idealistically noble. When I first read every ERB novel I could get my hands on in Middle School, Tarzan was always Tarzan, but there was something about John Carter that somehow made him the greater hero in my eyes. Maybe it was the way he handled a sword or how he was always determined to make Barsoom a better place that made him seem Burrough's finest creation. Certainly you will find ERB's most imaginative work, including the great game of Martian Chess, in this series. Do not stop at the first book, because while these novels are fast approaching being a century old, they hold up much better than the writings of Jules Verne or H. G. Wells."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.As many reviewers of this and other ERB stories point out, do not expect \\"politically correct\\" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.\\"Princess of Mars\\" is an astounding piece of fantasy. First story of ERB to be published it contains the seeds of lots of sci-fi and Fantasy novels to come in the following years. Also we may detect some traits of Tarzan in John Carter character.It's a pleasure to read so \\"fresh\\" adventures depicting a whole planet culture, ecology, interaction between different races, monsters, and inventions far ahead of ERB real world, as \\"rifles with explosive bullets guided by wireless sensors\\".It amazes me how ERB can master in a rather short text (for our standards); a high paced action story. Even if this book is more than 90 years old, you will enjoy it from the first to the last page and possibly continue reading all Carter's series.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I am yet another reviewer who first read the entire &quot;Carter&quot; series as a boy (in the 1960's). I rediscovered them recently after listening to a Coast to Coast radio interview where Richard Hoagland (ex NASA consultant) valiently defended his rather wild thesis that Mars indeed once hosted an incredible civilization, as evidenced by the infamous &quot;face on mars&quot;, and the nearby pyramid and other ruins on the Cydonia Plains.Whether such assertions have any validity will be resolved eventually by science. Nonetheless,I realized with a moment of existentialist mirth that Edgar Rice Burroughs might be right! Out of the mouth of pulp fiction writers come revelations that will elude science for almost a century!?!Although there may be no glorious race of scantilly clad humans (for such prime and proper times as we assume 1912 to have been, Edgar relished describing the perfectly muscled and bronzed bodies of the martian warriers in their gleaming harnesses and the sumptous beauty of the semi-nude Martian maidens!) perhaps there was something similar, if you believe late night radio, eh? perhaps there are no barbaric 4 armed green warriers (is this where the proverbial &quot;little green men from Mars originated?), but how about little Grey aliens, eh?Edgar Rice Burroughs was certainly an influence on many subsequent sci-fi classics in the 20th century, including the much more clinical and psychologically focused Martian Chronicles. Others have noted the legacy he gave to the Star Wars series.Now at the ripe age of 51, I have reread the series and find them still a ripping good yarn, even if the romantic undertones seem a bit quaint in this brutish &quot;slam, bam, thank you maam&quot; culture we have created since his time.A final shocking revelation for me: As others have noted, the major protagonist in this book is the beautiful Martian Princess Dejah. Was there some bizarre subconscious bleed through here? You see, I named my daughter (now 30 years old) &quot;Desha&quot;. I haven't the heart to tell her that she may be named after a pulp fiction heroine from 1912! At least I changed the spelling of the name!Life can be banal and hard (like a Martian night outside the safety of city walls), so give yourself a break!

The series is worth owning and should be read for it's pure adventure."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Books that were popular years ago are frequently disappointments, particularly when they're so influential in shaping genres. Too often, the books that follow them exploit all of their novelty, so coming in late to the story means we already have the aftertaste in our mouth from all the most delicious bits; there's nothing left that's noteworthy or original (or rather, original-seeming). A Princess of Mars, however, has aged particularly well; a fact which is evidenced by the film adaptation due for release in 2012. Perhaps Burroughs' Mars series was thoroughly exploited by the pulp sci-fi of the 20's and 30's and I just had the good fortune to miss out on all that - I don't know. I just know that after I finishing the story (it didn't take long - it's a short book and reads quickly) I had a hunger for all things Martian.The story follows John Carter, a captain on the defeated side of the American side of the Civil War who goes out West to find a new fortune. Through methods not important, he finds himself transported from near-death on Earth to deathly danger on Mars (there known as \\"Barsoom\\"). John Carter is a man of courage, a man of no mean martial skill (no accidental concept-pun, that), and a man of honor, and through the force of these qualities (and the nifty feats his terran-trained muscles allow him to perform in Martian light gravity), he wins his fortune, along with the love of the most perfect woman of Barsoom.What works: the story is raw, unashamed pulp adventure, and captures every bit of the daring, excitement, despair, and thrill of unbelievable escapes that you could hope for. John Carter is the archetypal adventure here - brave, earthy, honest, quick to rise to any challenge that stands in his way. In that sense it's the pinnacle of the genre. It reads quickly, and rarely gets bogged down in lists of actions that can frequently hamper action scenes. Our chest swells vicariously for Carter's courage, and even an abundance of superlatives thrown at Dejah Thoris, the titular princess of Mars, seem to work because Carter sounds so sincere. If he says she's the most beautiful creature to walk any planet, we believe him. What elevates the novel from simple pulp, though, is the way it paints Mars. There's a sense of deep, extensive history, a sense that the planet and its inhabitants are thoroughly \\"other\\", but within the context of their otherness there are both generalizations (just as we can apply to ourselves), and widely variant individuals. The green men of Mars never really feel like humans with an extra pair of arms. The descriptions of the planet fit the Mars we can easily imagine until science reminds us that along with the lack of atmosphere and water (Barsoom's atmosphere is artificial and continuously replenished, and the planet is as dry as any desert), there is indeed no large-scale life on Mars.What doesn't work: While there are philosophical interludes, the pulp adventure of the story is it's primary - and nearly singular - note. If deeds of bravery and strength don't appeal to you and after the first few pages you don't think this book is your thing, you won't find any hidden redeeming qualities 100 pages in.The Takeaway: I read the second book by accident before the first, but the third is certainly in my book queue. If you have a Kindle, you can download the books for free from Amazon. If you don't, a paperback collection of the first several paperbacks is relatively cheap. If adventure (think Indiana Jones hybridized with the Grail Quests of the knights of the Round Table) appeals to you, you will love this book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"John Carter, Warlord of Mars, is one of the best known characters of early Science Fiction.The world of Mars, as described is lush, violent and beautiful. It's not logical, but who cares?This is a review of the free Kindle edition, and if you like fantasy or science fiction, you owe it to yourself to try this."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Writing in the old style, with larger than life indomitable heroes. Fortunately, I like that style. The first of the Barsoom series, this is both a \\"stranger in a strange land\\" type of story and an \\"opposites attract\\" love story. A great warrior of the American west is somehow transported from Earth to Mars. There he finds himself in a land of constant war, with customs and beliefs far different from those he knows. He slowly learns what he needs to know, in order to survive, and also, sees the woman who will be his great love. Unfortunately for him, the woman is a princess of a great nation-state, and has no time for a blundering landless warrior. His warrior ethics and skills, combined with the power of a man who grew up in Earth's far greater gravity, see him slowly rise through the ranks of this world. Although very different from those of this planet, his warrior skills, sense of honour, and unbending loyalty soon see him making loyal friends.Won't go much farther, lest I spoil it for those who want to read it for themselves. If you want a rip roaring adventure where loins are girded and swords decide the fate of a world, this series is the group of books for you. At one time even more popular than his other well know book series (Tarzan of the Apes), this is a truly great read.Just wonder if the books will see a great resurgence when the movie (John Carter of Mars) comes out in 2012."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer in that you can't think about this story too logically. You'll end up tearing it apart and hating it. Instead, this is a wonderful adventure story. John Carter goes to Mars (yes, POOF!) and becomes this fantastical, god-like being (seriously, the guy gets out of every situation). He falls in love with the staggeringly beautiful Dejah Thoris and there is plenty of adventure in between. This is light and a very fast read. While Burroughs definitely wrote it for an older audience, it reminded me of reading a child fantasy novel- very sweet and very satisfying, while still throwing in a little bit of an adrenaline kick. Plus, when you're done with this book, there are about 10 others in the series!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"this book i had to read for a book report i thought it was pretty good it was really hard to read cause the typing is written in like a 4.5 size but over all it was pretty good"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I recently completed reading the Princes of Mars and felt both the joy and sorrow of reaching the end of a well spun tale that I haven't experienced in years. I felt I had been on a wonderful journey savoring the final pages of the book and wondering what had taken me so long to begin the series. As a child I must admit I loved the old Tarzan movies, which were based on the books of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Every afternoon after school we were met with either a Three Stooges movie or a Tarzan movie. The play of children constantly riddled with the call of Tarzan, the ape man rang through our neighborhood as we climbed trees, hurtling from branch to branch in our relentless pursuit of turning our neighborhood into the jungles of Africa. The appeal of such movies, regardless of the stereotypical representations of people of color and women, were a joy to a young mind for they were adventures of the type unseen in the urban streets of our community.Therefore, even though I had scarcely heard of the John Carter series before I read my first page, I was captured immediately with the beauty of description painstakingly rendered by Edgar Rice Burroughs of his fantastic environments from the terrain of Arizona to the terrain of Mars, to the people, the battles, and the wars. The honor of men fighting to the death with out fear and with the honor of duty regardless of the odds against them or the heinous nature of their enemies was actually a joy to read and made me anxious to learn the outcome of a people that had been raised to fight on a planet that was named after the Roman god of war.My early reading of classical mythology; my growing up impatiently waiting for the next television episode of Star Trek; my wonder at the concepts of equality for men, women and people of color were satiated with each installment of the classic science fiction series of Star Trek and therefore it was inevitable that I fell in love with the journey that Burroughs set me upon in his tale of the Princess of Mars.This book was written in 1912 by a man who was born in the antebellum north, eleven years after the conclusion of our Civil War. His father was a veteran of the Civil War and his writing resonates of a young man who was possibly influenced by tales of war and the study of war from an education that was permeated with military history.What amazes me about the first John Carter installment is how I saw similarities of various science fiction television episodes that I have enjoyed over the decades. I vaguely saw the concept of teleportation and sliding from one universe to another as depicted in Star Trek and the series Sliders and described by Burroughs as he depicts John Carter's first trip to Mars. I noted the concept of the various races of Martian humanity, the men of Barsoom, being similarly depicted in the television series Star Trek Enterprise when the final antagonist bent upon the destruction of earth are the inhabitants of the planet Xindi with six major sentient beings representing aquatic, primate, arboreal, insect, reptile, and an extinct avian species, very similar to the warlike nature of the men of Barsoom. The Xindis generally fought amongst themselves with such vehemence that an entire species as well as their home planet had been destroyed, this concept is also described in the Princess of Mars. However when the thought of their annihilation by earth was foretold by various manipulative time travelers the Xindi forged an alliance to fight a common enemy, again similar to the story-line in the Princess of Mars. The carnage depicted in the battles fought on Mars also reminded me of a history of World War 1 as described by historian Barbara Tuchman in The Guns of August in the Belgian defense against Germany in the first battle of the war, the assault on Liege. I also saw similarities in the conflict of the Spartans against the Persians in the battle of Thermopylae.Not sure what attracts me to well described battles and both the horrors and glories of war, but I found a perverse and utterly enjoyable read in the Princess of Mars and at the same time I was saddened by the type of fiction that is so prominent in today's society which does not allow the mind to travel to new worlds and new concepts.Even though the science is marred by the limitations of the period; even though those things that cannot be explained are lent to mysticism; the first installment of the John Carter series is recommended and definitely worth reading for those who love swashbuckling adventure."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Not only is this a great series, especially the early ones, but this particular set has the very best cover artwork.I still have them."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I bought this book because the movie trailer is absolutely enchanting.

This is the story that was the basis for the Disney movie \\"John Carter\\". The book is only decently written and while it does tell the story of John Carter and his exploits on Mars it is only so-so. Many books in re-print tend to leave the author's original work untouched. However there is a line that can easily be crossed to fix spelling and grammar errors that many publishers will not cross. I'm not sure if it for respect of the author or just laziness, but to read a book with so many grammar errors and spelling mishaps is frustrating in the least and annoying for the most part. This book has a lot of content that should have been fixed in its re-print. The story is written from a first person point of view, and mostly present tense, which lends itself to perhaps a limited audience as it is a tough read and not typical of a lot of books that I rather enjoy. The imagery is decent, but only so much as I have some frame of reference from the movie. It's a freebie as a Kindle book so its certainly worth the price and it may be just up your alley for reading. For my efforts it was not a good read overall and though I really enjoyed the movie, the book didn't bring that same level of story or imagery.

It features a strong and powerful introduction from bestselling author Junot Diaz, as he discusses the merits as well as the failings and strong racist overtones of the book.John Carter is a man who has served his time and is looking for gold in the Arizona hills. In a specific cave he is miraculously transported to the distant planet of Mars where he doesn't find a barren world, but one that is alive and diverse and complex. He soon discovers that with the lesser gravity on the planet he possess a sort of super-power in being able to make great leaps and strides in a single bound. He becomes involved in the political machinations of the planet, and finds himself fighting in a war he is all too familiar with. Then there is the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the red-skinned Princess of Helium, who he helps in any way he can for he is quite taken with her.The story very much feels one that was written a hundred years ago with skin color being so important and how women serve simple roles in these societies, but if one is able to ignore this and get past it, there is a great adventure story at the heart in the style of Indiana Jones and Errol Flynn.Originally written on July 17, 2012 Alex C.

If they had kept the book name, I would definitely have known. I decided to reread the book and see how closely the movie followed the book since I forgot so much as I am now 62. I am still thoroughly enjoying the book. It grabs you from the beginning and I am now 3/4 done and it is still grabbing me.

The story is still fresh, and Burroughs captured the ideas of inventing alien or fantasy cultures. Some authors have taken the concept further (e.g. Flash Gordon, Star Wars) and others have made a mockery of the model (e.g. Chronicles of Gor).

All of these books featured average men who possessed an attribute which made them extraordinary. Conan possessed great physical strength. Elric had his magic sword Stormbringer. For John Carter it was the atmosphere on Mars. The atmosphere of Mars, being different from Earth's, allowed John Carter the ability to leap fifty feet high through the air. Small and frail looking John Carter had an agility the large denizens of Mars could not possess. Of the three characters I mentioned and their unique traits, I've always liked John Carter best. Burroughs had a real gift for writing stories about men having to adapt to environments different from their own. Tarzan and so on. John Carter actually came before Tarzan. John Carter is a retired Confederate Civil War soldier. In the beginning of the novel he is pursued by Indians. After seeking shelter in a cave, Carter passes out. Upon waking Carter has found himself mysteriously whisked away to Mars where he must save a princess and fight off green behemoth barbarians.

It is both good and bad, hence the three stars. The bad? Forget the science of 1912, look at what is still correct but how Burrough's corrupts it. The difference in gravity, and hence the Superman in John Carter, but he is only Superman once, at the start of a battle, during the fighting he is no better than the natives. And this carries on for everything. The good? Burroughs knows how to create action, forget all else and expect almost continuous action and you've got it through the whole book. No wonder we do not have Superman, we would lose over 90% of the action. It is hard to pick out where superman exists in all occurrences, but if we forget him we forget we are on Mars. Likewise we forget the atmosphere machines and I think Burroughs does too. So take your pick, you can read the book for its action and adventure and enjoy it totally or you can try to see the lack of consideration given to the differences between someone born and bred on Earth and the same person born and bred on Mars. Then you lose the story, even forget the biology, women and their eggs mating with an earthman and his sperm. Even Burroughs should have known better, so better to avoid any attention to offspring.

Adventures ensue.I'd definitely lump this book into the Fantastic Fiction category. The word \\"Mars\\" in the title tempted me to think that Burroughs was making an early attempt at sci-fi. However, the location just allowed him to make his technology, character physiology, and sociology more outlandish.The story is colossally silly. If that were it's only fault I would be more understanding, but the book (especially the first half) is quite boring. \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" is also quite absurd, but it never becomes boring.My key objection is that Burroughs spends far too much time on anthropological exposition. I could forgive him if the verbose explanations of Martian culture truly added something to the story. They don't.Admittedly, the book becomes more action-oriented in the second half. Burroughs does have a knack for writing action but unfortunately that's about all the book has going for it. The book uses a ludicrous plot, uninspired setting and cardboard cutouts for characters.I'm in my mid 20s and I just read this book for the first time. I have a very strong feeling that I would have enjoyed A Princess of Mars much more if either (1) I had I been younger when I first read it, or (2) I had read it closer to its original publication date.Yes, it's a classic, but from my perspective, that doesn't make it a good read. I'm perfectly happy to read books for mindless entertainment. This one just isn't entertaining. If you want to read it for nostalgic purposes or to gain a historical perspective of sci-fi, go for it.

Burroughs wrote this book for a WW II audience, so your grand or great-granddad and grandma will remember this writer through his books, movies, and TV shows."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I grew up having the Tarzan novels read to me. So I always thought Burroughs was a great author. Until the advent of the Kindle, however, the John Carter series was impossible to find anywhere. I was finally half-way thru the series when they announced the movie and I was thrilled to hear about it. Princess of Mars is the first book in this series and one of the best. For younger readers it may be a bit confusing in areas, but overall the book is just plain absorbing. This is what a book was meant to be: fun, riveting, entertaining. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"A really exciting action-packed adventure book. Written before Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs, I wondered if this was going to use an English language that I understood. Guess what? This book could have been written today. It reads great!The story revolves around a Civil War veteran that gets lost, finds himself on Mars (Barsoom for you Martians reading this), seems to have super hero abilities, and finds that there really is life on Mars. While he fights strange green beings, white apes, and red humanoids, he also finds time to fall in love with the most beautiful girl in the universe.Written as what must have seemed like far-fetched science fiction in 1912, this book keeps alive the idea that life could exist in far away planets, even if it is not like ours today. This book is a great read for those seeking entertainment. Forget the everyday life, for a few hours, at least. Immerse yourself in pure fantasy. It really is okay once in while. I really liked this book, and its ability to allow me that pure escape that comes with it. I did not read it for anything other then entertainment, and I was not disappointed. After reading it, it leaves me thinking about the possibility of life on other planets. Do they really have to look like humans on earth? Why couldn't the creatures in this book be real? Are they really more far-fetched than the dinosaurs of earth? I wonder...This book, while standing alone as a great book, is followed by ten more in this series. I am reading them, one at a time, now. However, to enjoy this book it is not necessary to read the next."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I downloaded this (free) book to my Kindle and although some of the references seem dated (The author of all the Tarzan books wrote this about 100 years ago), I found it very interesting. The SURPRISE (to me) came as some of the names and references seemed familiar. It turns out the the recently released (and bombed) movie John Carter, IS THIS BOOK. READ the book! It's good. I may have to now watch the movie to see if Hollywood saw things as I did. Thank you amazon for the FREE Kindle books."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this. I know it's a science fiction classic, but often times classic does not mean good. This one is very good. It's written clearly. It's well paced. And it's an exciting adventure. I absolutely recommend this."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Aside from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels no other book has captured my imagination like John Carter has. I'm not much of a book reader and loved all of the Tarzan novels and have every one of them in origianl print and since I have read A princess of Mars I am looking forward to purchasing the whole Barsoom series and cannot wait to read them all."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Former Confederate captain John Carter, left with no means of income after the war, heads to Arizona and strikes a quartz mine. Trying to rescue his partner from Apaches, Carter takes a wrong turn and comes to a cave, in which he finds a large room, where he is overthrown by a paralytic gas. With a supreme effort, he attempts to move his muscles, but instead his spirit/soul/whatever leaves his body, and he thus exits the cave completely naked. Staring out at the night sky, Carter sees the planet Mars and feels called to by the god of war. He reaches out his arms, senses cold and darkness, and opens his eyes \\"upon a strange and weird landscape. I knew that I was on Mars.\\"If you can get past that extreme leap of faith, the rest of A Princess of Mars is pretty easy to stomach. Author Edgar Rice Burroughs (author also of the numerous Tarzan stories) peoples his debut novel (expanded from the short story \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\" and serialized in All-Story before being published as a novel in 1919) with characters that are easy to identify with, though they happen to be green-skinned Martians. Though I had long heard of the stories, I was first intrigued to try this one due to its being listed in the Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns, which stated that it falls firmly into the subcategory of Space Western (the same category under which Star Wars falls).It was primarily this, but also the fact that I had enjoyed Tarzan when I read it so long ago, that led me to seek it out -- preferably in audio, through which I do most of my literary experimentation. I found the Books In Motion audio at the library. Jack Sondericker reads A Princess of Mars from the perspective of time, much as the early part of the novel suggests. His voice is that of an man much older than the protagonist, leading a semblance of retrospective realism to this fantastic tale. (The Librivox audio is also a solid interpretation, with Mark Nelson offering a professional-quality reading that can be downloaded for free.)Because of the lighter gravity of Mars (\\"Barsoom\\" to the locals), Carter finds himself a superman among his new neighbors, able to leap 30 feet in the air and 100 feet away when threatened. The early chapters of A Princess of Mars are mostly given to writing of the expository sort, involving Carter's observations of the strange details of Martian life, peppered throughout with feats of his prowess, which impresses the seemingly unemotional Martians in the only way important to them. Carter even becomes a chieftain of the Tharks after defeating one of them.I don't usually get into books filled with made-up names and long descriptions of the differences between Earth and whatever planet the story happens to be set on, but Burroughs manages to make it interesting through sheer imagination, with just enough things not so different to balance the very different. A Princess of Mars is such a mythic success at this, it is impossible not to get involved in the exploits of John Carter and the female prisoner he comes across, who looks very different from the green-skinned Martians and who turns out to be Dejah Thoris, red-skinned princess of Helium.The rest of the book involves the duo's escape from Thark, as they fall for each other, get separated, then reunited, and eventually make a go of it. The ending would be a downer if I didn't know that there are numerous sequels, the first of which is The Gods of Mars. But if you're looking for a full reading experience, with plenty of action, adventure, and even romance, you'd do well to pick up a copy of A Princess of Mars."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"\\"I have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until I have passed over for eternity.

There is a wonderful following and I recommend you search the web for it.

They have excellent shipping & the product is in same or better condition than anticipated from their description. I will continue to buy from this supplier without hesitation."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I don't know why I always expect less of ERB when I pick up a new book by them. Yes, they all seem to have very similar elements--action, romance, strange new worlds, extreme heroism, etc. But somehow each book is an adventure worth reading on its own merits.I'm glad I decided to not read this series until I owned all of the books (its been a few years of trekking through used and new bookstores to acquire them all). So far I've read the first two, but I have my bookmark ready for the third. The first two are their own adventures and end in a way that is both satisfying for the story of the book but clearly sets up more to come.In this book John Carter is introduced to us, he is a cowboy and prospector attempting to make his fortune after being on the loosing side of the Civil War. He also has the interesting qualities of being immortal, not remembering any childhood and yet still being associated with a Southern family as a distant cousin, for many generations.He is chased into a cave by a band of Indians and very near death he looks upon the planet Mars. He awakens to find himself on Mars and confronted by four armed green men. Eventually he also meets the red men and masters the language and culture of the planet he now calls home. He also manages to come across an enslaved Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris.Its a great book, told from John Carter's point of view. Because of this you get a little better feel for him as a person than you do for Tarzan I'd say (and I love Tarzan, but there is something very appealing about John Carter).This is a book that will start one off on what looks to me to be a great series, but don't just get book one--get at least the first three because you will want to know what happens next.

It is quite short, but even so, the plot covers a lot of ground.John Carter finds himself transported to Mars, which the natives there call Barsoom. He is captured by the Tharks, four-armed green men, but earns their respect with his battle prowess. His earthly muscles and strength give him an advantage over the creatures of Barsoom, with the ability to make superhero leaps and deliver extreme force with a single blow. As John Carter makes allies and enemies among the Tharks, he meets Dejah Thoris, a princess from Helium. She is taken captive by the Tharks, but Carter vows to free her and return her to her home. As the adventure unfolds, they are swept up in a greater war.I enjoyed this book and rooted for John Carter the entire time. In some places the description of the world of Barsoom bogs down the pace. The love story was not terribly believable, but the interactions between Sola and the other Tharks made for a nice secondary plot."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"it was amazing to see how many ideas contained in this book found their way into popular science fiction movies made many years later"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I have been reading ERB since I was in high school.

The characters do not have modern sensibilities regarding racism and sexism. Still the work is an enjoyable adventure through a rich world."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.As many reviewers of this and other ERB stories point out, do not expect \\"politically correct\\" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.\\"Princess of Mars\\" is an astounding piece of fantasy. First story of ERB to be published it contains the seeds of lots of sci-fi and Fantasy novels to come in the following years. Also we may detect some traits of Tarzan in John Carter character.It's a pleasure to read so \\"fresh\\" adventures depicting a whole planet culture, interaction between different races, monsters, ecology, and inventions far ahead of ERB real world, as \\"rifles with explosive bullets guided by wireless sensors\\".It amazes me how ERB can master in a not so extensive text (for our standards); a high paced action story. Even if this book is 90 years old, you will enjoy it from the first to the last page and possibly continue reading all Carter's series.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Let me get this straight: A Princess of Mars was written in 1911? This space opera by Edgar Rice Burroughs contains all the fast-paced action and graphic violence of a modern day action movie. Hard to believe it was written almost one-hundred years ago.This is the first in the series of books about John Carter, Warlord of Mars. Carter, a Civil War veteran from Virginia, finds himself on Mars and in the middle of continual fighting between the tribes of Martians, some of whom are pretty nasty fellows. The Martian atmosphere gives Carter some extra abilities that the otherwise stronger Martians do not have. Of course, some of the Martian races look quite human, and Carter falls for the sexy Dejah Thoris, a princess of one of the more homosapien-like species.This tale is just good old-fashioned fun. Another of Burrough's fictional creations is more famous, the jungle lord Tarzan, but I believe now is the time for John Carter to become as popular. Despite its age, this book would appeal to today's movie audiences. With the successful crossover of fantasy novels into movies such as The Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia, the time is ripe for John Carter novels to be transformed into motion pictures. From what I've read, it has been proposed over and over for years, but until now, computer graphics probably would not have done it justice. A Princess of Mars would be a spectacular sight to see on the big screen.In the meantime, indulge in the guilty pleasure of reading this gratuitously violent, rip-roaring, somewhat sexist tale of the swashbuckling John Carter."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I'm writing from a point-of-view that belongs to the 21yr, sci-fi freak, martial artist, I.D.F soldier, israeli citizen, and man that I am.The series of books this book begins, is something that should unite all mankind in it's pleasures, it's wonder, it's fascinating mind (from 1912!), in great things sci-fi make you think of, in it's mind-developing in kids, and other pluses.Mean while, those great pleasures are saved, reluctently, to us alone, science-fiction readers. You should be happy that YOU have an open mind- to enjoy &quot;Princess from Mars&quot;. Wonderfull world, exciting life-forms, cruel fighters, beautifull princesess, non-stop action, with this BASIC masterpiece from the dawn of sci-fi.An avid reader can spot the &quot;Barsoom&quot; and &quot;Jhon Carter&quot; in many of the later coming top-authors. Zelazney AND Larry Niven are amongst those who paid tribute to Edgar rice Burroughs in their works (Niven I believe, was very influenced by Tars Tarakas, while writing &quot;Ringworld&quot;, and conjuring Speaker-to-animals.)Anyway, I found those books in my continuing study of old sci-fi, and they are ofcourse among my most treasured ones, with 12 (for now) books of A.e Van Vogt, and the Lensmen series of E.E Smith.And don't think im one of those old-guys who read nothing written after the 50' too. I've read Niven, Zelazney, Heinlin, Asimov, silverberg, Sheffield, Vinge, Bester,'K.Dick, williamson, Holdman, Herbert, Hoze Farmer, and many more. Those books i'm talkin' about are written with a different style maybe, but they are just as good as modern sci-fi knockout's like &quot;Dune&quot; or &quot;Ringworld&quot; or I don't know, the're excellent!For those &quot;Hard sci-fi only&quot; guys(with you at spirit) these books tend to be somewhat fantastical. But that's because they were written before sci-fi and fantasy broke away in their own directions and became different janres. Just don't say I didn't warn 'ya. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is the first Edgar Rice Burroughs book I've read, and it won't be the last.Princess of Mars is a fantastic action story, very fast paced. If the opening of this book doesn't catch you, then I don't know what to tell you. It really is fantastic. I really love that John Carter is a man of action, making decisions based on what is right, and asking himself later if it was a good idea, never looking for oppurtunities for heroism. Sometimes it gets him into trouble, but it usually works out in his favor.The characters are unforgetable, I love that they slowly unfold before you during the story. Characters who at first seem like 'extras' develop a depth you may not have expected. You find yourself suddently hoping that the characters' hopes and dreams are achieved, pushing yourself to read just a little bit more before you go to bed so you can find out how it turns out.Sometimes I feel like Burroughs sort of skimped out on some details, but it doesn't take away from the story. He will sum up an epic battle in just two lines, leaving you to your own devices to imagine the actual fight. But this is only with some scenes, and it would probably just add length more than content if he had detailed out every single fight in the book.Just don't make the mistake of watching the movie made in 2004. Really, it's not even the same story, I got about 15 minutes deep before turning it off.

I was amused at first by the writing (written almost exactly 100 years ago now), not so much for the phrases and words (though they are amusing at times) but the style and the way the characters are portrayed. This is truly a peek at the sensibilities of an older age.However, once you get over (or used to) the over romanticized hero, to whom no danger raises so much as an eyebrow, you will live (or re-live) a classic tale that is nicely told.

As you read this book, you'll actually sort of wonder why the Mars Rovers didn't come across the peoples and civilizations described, and you'll feel a bit sad that they did not.Burroughs describes two societies, one somewhat different than our own, and one completely different. He includes animals, races, social customs, and physiology that were far ahead of his time in terms of literary imagination. Of course, his books were written, self admitedly, as pulp. There are flaws in plotting and some cliche in character development, but these are quickly washed away by the compelling story and the struggles of the hero to survive, and to help those natives of Mars for whom he has come to care.If you somehow missed these books before, they are good reads, for either older children or adults with a taste for the fanciful. The first few of the series have fallen into the public domain, and you can obtain them for free either here on Amazon for your Kindle, or from places like Project Gutenberg as text files.The first three books comprise a trilogy: A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and Warlord of Mars. All three are public domain.Read, enjoy, and be carried away into a world you'll bemoan the loss of when you are done with the books!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I can recall reading this series when I was about 11....many years ago.

Of course, that's hardly news for Edgar Rice Burroughs fans. The whole Barsoom series is a great read, as are many of the author's other works (i.e. Tarzan).One thing to note, though, is that these stories were not written to become classics or, honestly, even \\"literature.\\" Burroughs wrote for the joy of writing, and then learned he could turn a nice profit from writing pulp fiction for cheap magazines. The stories are simple, often hokey, and far beyond belief. But really that's what makes \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and other books in the Barsoom series so fun to read!Don't pay any attention to the somewhat painful 2012 film version.

John Carter is a man's man, and real action adventure hero - like Tarzan.One thing that I find to be a shortcoming of the storyline is how John Carter gets to Mars in the first place...but once he's there the story rolls along nicely. The book and movie follow a similar story line in many ways, but differ in others.When the movie was made the writers had to devise a way to get Carter to Mars in an explainable way, which they do. Once Carter gets there in the book he meets Woola, Sola, Tars Tarkas, Deja Thoris, Sab Than, and so on.I thoroughly enjoyed the read, and may continue reading the rest of the series again.While this will never be considered great literature, it is a worthy addition to the world of early 20th Century Sci-fi.4 stars for writing, 5 stars for fun."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is Classic Edgar Rice Burroughs!

When I heard they were making a John Carter movie, I decided to read the book first and I am glad I did. I am sure that if Edgar Rice could see what they did to his masterpiece he would have been rolling in his grave. The amount of thought and imagination that was placed in this book is just amazing. To create creatures, cultures, languages, customs, describe and go into the mechanics of science, physics, and engineering of the technologies found on the planet were just ingenious. Most of these concepts were completely overlooked in the movie, which I find to be a great shame. Please, if you have not read the book yet do so! It explains so much that the movie simply ignores. The characters are rich in personality and heart, from the good and faithful Woola, to the feisty princess, to friends from all backgrounds and races, to the brave John Carter himself. The adventures are filled with danger and surprises around every corner. This is a great book/series for any adventure/sci-fi reader."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Book so smooth its like watching a movie in your head....

John Carter the Star of it all... want to watch it in 3D next..."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Extra ordinary in both its imagination and the age in which it was written. By far the best of the Mars books. Burroughs ability to paint landscapes with words and easy delivery of emotional gratification makes this worth the read."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Yes Virginia, science fiction and fantasy existed long before George Lucas created Star Wars. It existed in the mind of Edgar Rice Burroughs who many know through his Tarzan series. In Burrough's A Princess of Mars one finds every aspect of Star Wars; a heroic figure, a beautiful princess, forces of evil and in the end good triumphing over evil. All of this set in for Burrough's time on so distant planet with alien technology equally and in some instances more interesting than in the original Star Wars. In fact while reading this action packed story, I could not help but see the connection between Burrough's story written in the first half of the 20th century and Star Wars. This was an entertaining and fun read. Further, the Kindle price was right."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"A great read and a refreshing change. A swashbuckling, fly by the seat of your pants good time. Pure fiction, pure imagination, pure escapism."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I did not know what to expect when ordering this book. I had seen the Disney film and enjoyed it. The book is enough like the movie to where I did not feel lost. Yet the book is quite different. Whether book or film, I usually enjoy the version I see first more. But these are different enough that I enjoyed them both equally. Having been written around the turn of the 20th century the style is different than one is use to today. But the author keeps the story moving along. I did not want to put the story down. As I purchased the electronic version I thought if I did not enjoy them I could delete them from my iPad. However I have decided to keep it for future reading."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Mars is a very interesting planet in our solar system for a few reasons. It's named after the Roman god of war, it's reddish-rust-like color has given it nicknames like \\"the red planet\\" and \\"the red star\\", and it's over 141 million miles away from the sun. It seems like a very curious place to explore. But have you have found yourself on the planet where there are green barbarians, tough princesses and a out-of-this-world romance? That's what readers will find in this truly must-read sci-fi classic.Told by the main character as an elderly man, we meet John Carter who is a Virginian and is exploring a cave in the mountains of Arizona with his captain James K. Powell who are both on a journey to gold-filled quartz. After getting into trouble with Indians and ending up unconscious in the cave, he ends up falling asleep and finding himself on the planet of Mars without any clothes. John observes the atmosphere of Mars and its living creatures, and judging by their features, they're far different from human people. He is suddenly taken by warriors and is in a chamber filled with the Martians and their chief Tars Tarkas, but escapes along with Sora, an eight feet woman and a tough frog-like canine named Woola. After learning more of Martian life, he is off with Woola by his side to the hills and meets Dajah Thoris, the Princess of Helium in a fight with Tars Tarkas and his warriors. As time goes by, John is already falling in love with Dajah. But his journey will bring him to a battle full of danger which will determine the fate for him and his companions, his journey back home and his true love for Dajah Thoris.\\"A Princess of Mars\\" instantly won me over at the beginning of the story. The plot is flawless and imaginative, even with the explanation of Martian life. The main character John Carter is one unforgettable person and has a daring and interesting feeling as well as Dajah Thoris, Tars Tarkas, Sora, and even Woola. The novel sorta has that similar feeling to Ray Bradbury and Robert Jordan. Readers will truly see this novel as a classic piece of science fiction, thanks to it's blend of action, thrills and romance. I cannot wait to see what will happen next for John Carter, and readers will be eager to see that as well. So for \\"A Princess of Mars\\", it's already one of my favorite novels I've ever read and readers will see Mars in a whole different way."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"We saw the movie \\"John Carpenter\\" and had to read the book based on this movie. Anything by Burroughs is wonderful reading as is \\"Princess of Mars\\". The movie followed the book very closely. The book was, as usual, more detailed and fun to read. This is a must read book. It is short and fast reading. There is a lot of \\"meat\\" to think over in our times today!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book was not your standard science fiction-it was older and or so interesting. The author gives the \\"Martians\\" strange and wonderful names that are worth a smile or two. How the main character got to Mars was strange and never clear. The action scenes are many and wild. The author paints a complex portrait of what he feels Mars looks like and who the people are. The main character,John Carter even fall in love with a native Martian."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a classic scifi book..

I am picking up a copy on amazon as I will be sending the older printing I found in a used bookstore to my uncle, who was introduced to science fiction through the eyes of John Carter. This book is of a class with a wonderful group of fiction writers including Robert Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, and even Tolkien. Basically if you like Flash Gordon, Tarzan, Conan, and Cuthulu you will very probably enjoy John Carter and Dejah Thoris."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"As most of the world already knows, \\"A Princess of Mars\\" is the first of 11 Burroughs novels that tell of John Carter's adventures on the planet Barsoom (Mars, to we Earthlings). This was Burroughs' very first novel, and one of the first books in the swashbuckling space-opera vein; perhaps the very first. It is a marvel of fast-moving action and imagination; indeed, practically every page offers some new marvel or piece of outrageous spectacle. Unfortunately, the book also displays some of the weaknesses of the novice author, but these weaknesses are more than counterbalanced by the pace, color and detail of the story. Burroughs' imagination seemed to be working overtime in this first book. The descriptions of alien life-forms, dead cities, Barsoomian customs and battles are very well drawn, although those battle scenes could have lasted a little longer, for me. (Burroughs might have learned a thing or two from, say, H. Rider Haggard about presenting detailed battle scenes.) There are occasional flashes of strangeness, too; e.g., the ability of Barsoomian psychologists to read the minds of murdered soldiers, and the celibate tax imposed by the Barsoomian government on confirmed bachelors! The book reads more like a fantasy/fairy tale than sci-fi, and the characters are pulpy in the extreme. There are hissable villains, noble warriors, a beautiful princess who needs saving, good and bad monsters, and the like. This book has been so influential that it is amusing, while reading it, to think of all the modern variations. For example, has anybody else been reminded of Princess Leia trapped by Jabba the Hutt of \\"Star Wars\\" fame, when reading of the beautiful Princess Dejah Thoris being leered at by the monstrously huge Thark jeddak, Tal Hajus? So many scenes resonate like that, and the book is almost prototypical in this respect. This is a true classic of the genre.However, like I said at the beginning, there are some problems. Besides the outrageous pseudoscience (I refer here to the \\"8th and 9th rays\\" that make possible antigravitation and oxygen manufacture), which I don't mind at all, there are some real discrepancies. For example, in one scene, Carter is said to be riding in his assigned position at the rear of a troop of Tharks; then he is mentioned as being at the very front! Carter is on Barsoom for only a few days before he picks up the Barsoomian vocabulary, which is said to be a simple one. However, he speaks very grandiloquently, as in this sentence: \\"I understand that you belittle all sentiments of generosity and kindliness, but I do not, and I can convince your most doughty warrior that these characteristics are not incompatible with an ability to fight.\\" Pretty good talking, for one who has just learned \\"simple\\" Barsoomian a few days before!!! Another problem I had was the scene in which a body of 150,000 Tharks sneak up on the city of Zodanga, unnoticed and unheard. Does this seem possible? As for the scene in which Carter and Kantos Kan fight in the arena...doesn't all the fighting seem a wee bit too easily accomplished? And then there is the matter of Burroughs' writing itself. I mentioned the common mistakes of a tyro writer. By this, I mean repetitive phrases such as \\"I stole stealthily\\" and \\"essayed...to attempt,\\" as well as endless mistakes of punctuation. I wonder if anybody ever copyedited this book. \\"A Princess of Mars\\" first appeared with the title \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\" in \\"All-Story Magazine\\" in 1912, and I'm not sure whether these magazine stories were edited and proofread or what. The book would not have suffered for a professional once-over. But you know what? In the end, all these little nitpickings matter not a whit, because all the minor problems, as I said, are swept away in the drive and excitement of the great story. And that story is as compelling as they come."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"ERB's Mars series kicks off in fine form with \\"A Princess of Mars\\", introducing the world to the steadfast, heroic John Carter.We learn of his adventures in saving the life (and winning the heart ) of Princess Dejah Thoris, of unifying the Martian hordes, and in general, doing all sorts of cool stuff.Burroughs' straightforward, fantastic style of writing only loses momentum when dealing with various goofy Martian names, but that's a problem I have with any sci-fi book that gets carried away with minutiae like that. Here, he keeps that to a minimum. His prose has a locomotive force, keeping the pages turning at a fast clip.The romance here is quite powerful as well. The simplicity and singlemindedness of Carter's devotion to Thoris was a little \\"too much\\" at its' inception, but they pretty much won me over by the last page.As all good books should, this definitely leaves you wanting more after you've finished...you have been warned."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Call it a guilty pleasure, but I love these types of books - the type of pulp fiction where the heroes are heroic and villains dastardly, and the women are beautiful. Its also great to be able to read a great piece of science fiction/fantasy that is fast paced and not 700 pages long. A Princess of Mars is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I first read it a age 15 and have just finished reading it again. The imagination that went into creating the world of Barsoom is truely a work of art. The only books of this type that come close to the Barsoom series are Robert E. Howards Conan books and The Lord of the Rings. You owe it to yourself to pick up this book and read a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs will always be remembered first and foremost for his creation of Tarzan, but it was the character of John Carter, who first appeared in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; who truly served as a template for other science fiction writers. From Lin Carter's &quot;Green Star&quot; series to John Norman's &quot;Gor&quot; novels there are tales of the man from Earth traveling to a strange new world and having wondrous adventures. John Carter was a gentleman of Virginia and Civil War veteran who found himself looking down at his dying body in an Arizona cave after an encounter with some Indians. Opening his arms to the bright planet Mars beckoning in the night sky, Carter is suddenly whisked to the Red Planet, where rival tribes battle while the planet's atmosphere continues to dissipate.Captured by a band of six-limbed giants, Carter soon earns their respect for his prowess as a warrior and forges a lasting friendship with Tars Tarkas of the Tharks. But then the Tharks attack a fleet of airborne vessels and capture Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, the greatest city on Barsoom (as the Martians call Mars). Of course, they get off on the wrong foot, since Carter knows nothing about the culture of the red humanoid race. But the lovely Princess of Mars has captured the Virginian's heart. Abandoning dreams of returning to Earth, he wants nothing better than to win her love. In the meanwhile, he has to protect her from the amorous attention of the depraved ruler of the Tharks, bring some semblance of civilization to the barbarian tribes, and stop all out war between the green men and red men from ending Barsoom's last chance for survival.&quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; is the first of eleven volumes in the Martian Series by Burroughs, most of which involve a hero fighting his way across Barsoom to rescue the woman he loves. If Dejah Thoris is not the most beautiful woman in the history of fantasy and science fiction, then she certainly has the all-time best name. John Carter is able to take advantage of the Red Planet's lesser gravity to do great feats of leaping about, but it is his innate intelligence and intense sense of personal honor that make him almost idealistically noble. When I first read every ERB novel I could get my hands on in Middle School, Tarzan was always Tarzan, but there was something about John Carter that somehow made him the greater hero in my eyes.Maybe it was the way he handled a sword or how he was always determined to make Barsoom a better place that made him seem Burroughs's finest creation while Tarzan was finding lost civilizations in the interior of Africa. Certainly you will find ERB's most imaginative work, including the great game of Martian Chess, in this series. Do not stop at the first book, because while these novels are fast approaching being a century old, they hold up much better than the writings of Jules Verne or H. G. Wells. Not in terms of science, of course, but rather in terms of adventure fantasy."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Quite simply, this is my favorite book. The story is told first person by John Carter, a former civil war officer who is &quot;projected&quot; to Mars. The story centers around his adventures in the alien world with Dejah Thoris, a princess, and Tars Tarkas, a great green warrior. His adventures help both them and himself to find humanity and happiness in an otherwise bleak, dying world. A Princess Of Mars is an epic tale of romance, war, friendship, and the personal struggles of a man, once lost, finding himself; but what sets it apart from the rest is the truely human struggles of its truely human characters."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I recently reread A Princess Of Mars primarily to see if I would enjoy it as much at 34 as I did at 14. I was not disappointed. Burroughs' Martian novels remain, for me, among the most purely FUN books I have come across in a lifetime of reading. There's a little something here for the adolescent male in all of us.In a word: Yahoo!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"After fighting in the Civil War, John Carter travels west with a friend to pan for gold. Attacked by Indians, his friend is killed.John Carter not only survives the attack, he is transported from Arizona to the desert sea bottoms of Mars. He encounters green, six-limbed nomadic warriors, red skinned humans, and a beautiful princess.This page turning book is filled with everything you ever wanted in Science Fiction. Edgar Rice Burrows great writing makes \\"A Princess of Mars\\" come to life. With his impeccable attention to detail and brilliant storytelling, travel on a journey filled with aliens, strange plants, a beautiful princess, and a great hero."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"The previous reviews all tell about how good the Martian Tales of ERB are.The heroes of ERB, John Carter, John Clayton (Tarzan), et al are what make the books readable. Without their bravery, cunning, fatalism, philosophy, strength, ability to inspire, and sense of humor I doubt I would have reread all the books in the series with their redundant plots. But I did.Lets not forget that John Carter, of the Martian Series, is the precursor to an even more famous hero...Clark Kent (Superman). Perhaps if ERB had never been in the depths of dispair in his pencil selling business, he would never have written A Princess of Mars and the whole of American Sci Fi and comics would have been different."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a type of science fiction that is pure fantasy, there are no fancy explanations of technology here. This was written in a time that there were simple rockets, but no one really believed we'd be able to put a person in space, so it's interesting to see how people thought of other worlds. Needless to say, Mars in this book is not the dull frozen planet we've seen in the news, but a lush moss covered world brimming with bizarre creatures, developed technologies and politics. What is described in this book is a whole new world created of pure imagination, with bizarre creatures, romance, heroism, exploration and discovery, and non stop action. I LOVED this book, I couldn't put it down. You find find anything described realistic, but the plot and imagination will grab you. If you like pure escapism, this is definitely the read. It concerns an army man who is suddenly transported to Mars and immediately has to start dealing with the various political forces and creatures and dangers there."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"After watching and enjoying the movie John Carter, I saw that it was based on A Princess of Mars.The book and the movie have a lot of character similarities, but the story is quite different.I must say that I enjoyed each and would recommend the book to anyone who is a reader and enjoyed the movie."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Loved the series and though it was written so long ago, it is still a great book to read. Awesome."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Pulpy fun at its best. Not much depth or character development here, but the creativity in the world building (particularly for the era in which it was written) is delightful from beginning to end. Doesn't show the same grasp of storycraft as found in some of Burroughs's later works, but it's still a fun, fast read."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I saw the movie \\"John Carter\\" and decided to read the book. Books starts with lots of action, bogs down a bit in the middle with all the Thark business, then goes full steam ahead to the finale. Enjoyable reading and good companion to the movie."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"As the author ofThe 5 Moons of Tiiana / The Chronicles of Rez CantorI was heavily influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs. As a young boy I spent hours reading about John Carter and his fantastic adventures. Edgar Rice Burroughs had a wonderful imagination and a talent for bringing it all to life. I enthusiastically give all of his works five stars and I hope you will take the time to read them."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This novel really started the career of the creator of Tarzan, E RBurroughs. John Carter is transported from Earth to Mars, where his heavyplanet physiology gives him great strength and agility. He meets theTharks, four armed green giants as cruel as any people of Earth, and theRed Martians, humanlike in all attributes but birth and skin color. Theadventure is grand. I read this book first when I was in my teens, thenagain last year in order to reacquaint myself before the movies release.Still great stuff and worth while to read. If you want to see where a lotof the future science fiction came from, read this book. Heck, read thewhole series. I know I will read the rest of them again."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When I first learned that The Princess Bride movie was based on a book, I was curious how the source material would hold up. I mean, the movie was freakin' hilarious! The book did not disappoint. In like manner, reading A Princess of Mars after seeing the movie, John Carter, is like watching the extended version of the film. Just like The Princess Bride, the characters in John Carter are so true to A Princess of Mars that I pictured them as I was reading the book and gained a greater appreciation for each one. Woola in particular was one of my favorites in the movie, and he has so many more cool scenes in the book!Anyhow, all this to say, of you haven't read A Princess of Mars yet, download this FREE Kindle copy and get reading. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I first read this book when I was about 9 years old. My father (one of the OG, Original Geeks) pointed me at Burroughs and Wells to ensure that I would turn out just as geeky as humanly possible. This book invented a genre. I consider it the first, best example of Military SF. Following John Carter's campaign and rise to power is just plain fun.The best part about this whole series, is that it is chaste enough to put in front of sensitive younger readers in the 9-11 range without any reservations.This is the perfect way to get your budding geeks headed squarely for Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, and all the others we hold so dear."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When I asked my father, some years ago, who were his favorite authors when he was growing up, his eyes lit up and he sat upright and you could tell right away that, as his son, he had waited for the day that I would ask him that question. He disappeared in his mind, and rushed up to the attic of his memories, and dusted off everything he could remember about this first book Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter series. Clearly, this book practically defined my father's childhood. And if it, in any way, defined HIM I needed to know if it, in any way, reached down to me, as well.One result from reading this book is I got to read an author I suppose might have gone completely unread on my part and I think that would have been sad. ERB is a fantastic writer that paints all his images by word and doesn't bog you down with too much detail. His pacing is comfortable and logical and surprisingly simple for a book that was so far ahead of its time that it wasn't until the movie, star wars, that much of his imagery would be put to use (he wrote the first book in 1917), and is now considered cliche. I encourage everyone over the age of 7 to make this book a must read along with all the other John Carter's books by Burroughs. Thanks dad and I look forward to doing the same for my kids."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"It's hard to believe this story was written in 1912. This book is a tremendously fun read and the writing holds up extremely well by today's standards.The novel tells the story of Captain John Carter, an ex-Confederate soldier who travels to Arizona in search of gold. After a hostile encounter with Apaches forces him to hide inside a small cave with seemingly magical properties, Carter find himself transported astrally to Mars. While Burroughs spends little time trying to explain how this is possible, he accomplishes this transition quickly, for after the first ten pages the story proceeds on Mars where the real fun begins. Carter is captured by a race of giant, green Martians called Tharks, who live in an excessively violent tribal society and inhabit the ruins of ancient cities long abandoned by those who built them. His captivity and his relationship with two of the Tharks, the warrior Tars Tarkas and Carter's caretaker, Sola, comprised many of my favorite scenes in the novel. Carter, who inherits super-human strength and the ability to leap great distances due to Mars' lower gravity, uses his fighting skills to advance to a position of respect in the Thark's warlike culture, all the while accompanied by Woola, a dog-like creature that becomes Carter's lovable sidekick.The plot takes off after the Tharks capture Dejah Thoris, a human-looking, red Martian princess from the city of Helium. Carter is drawn toward the beautiful princess, but must contend with her mysterious customs and fierce pride, creating some of the most classic scenes in the novel, which at its core is a love story. Carter's struggle to save Dejah Thoris, first from the Tharks and later from a hostile race of red Martians called the Zodangans, dominates the rest of this rollicking adventure tale. While some of the scenes may seem a bit clich&eacute;, that's only because this novel is the original source material which inspired so many later works of science fiction and fantasy written in past hundred years. And that's why this book, to me, is little awe inspiring - for without it, it's hard to imagine what the world of scifi and fantasy fiction would look like today."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"As an Edgar Rice Burroughs fan I am always surprised at how well his work portrays the future of today's writers."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book is exactly what all sci fi and fantasy books should be: imaginative, full of adventure, plenty of action, and so much more. It is by far the most accessible book written more than 50 years ago that I've ever read, making it suitable for all ages. And, as other reviewers have stated, it is not just for boys. It contains strong female characters,considering the time that it was written. If you like adventure novels, you will love this book. I didn't have a problem with the formatting."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Thanks for the quick service you are a good seller to deal with. The item came well packaged against damage."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I got the Kindle version and I am reading that version now. Originally, I found an old paperback book which I found was a fascinating read and I knew I would reread the story.There are movies of the story out there, but they lack something. The book version is so much more that the movie John Carter (which had the best visual effects over previous movies by the way) and there are other lacking B-Movies I have seen, but they have cheap effects. One's mind can have very imaginative visions of what happens in a story, and for that reason I think the book version is more entertaining than any movie, as it has more details, give you time to dwell in the story longer and is an escape to another fantastic world.This is the first of about ten books in this Mars (Barsoom) series. I found it difficult to find all the other books as used books for sale. I had managed to get some audio book version of up to five stories, but I did not find the actually books, and I did not experience the entire series yet.Happily I found that many are of the stories are available on Kindle, and I am excitedly looking forward to experience the Kindle version of the stories and hopefully I will locate all ten books, which are as follows:1) Princess of Mars (1912), 2) The Gods of Mars (1914), 3) The Warlords of Mars (1918), 4) Thuvia, Maid of Mars (1920), 5) The Chessmen of Mars (1922), 6) Mastermind of Mars (1928), 7) Fighting Man of Mars (1931), 8) Swords of Mars (1936), 9) Synthetic Men of Mars (1940), and 10) Liana of Gathol (1948). {I'm not sure if the last one is actually related since the author calls Venus Gathol. I guess I will have to read the story to verify that information, also another note, I think these dates are more accurate than mentioned in the description of the Amazon page}.One has to realize that these stories are groundbreaking stories in a time before Star Trek, Star Wars and modern science-fiction. In fact, I think these stories had a profound influence on the writers of those movies and other great science-fiction writers of the past few decades. Anyway, my points are it is better than any movie, a great read, and I hope we all can find the entire Mars series."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"it is very good, it keeps you on the edge of your seat just about the hole time. thank you for asking"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I was intrigued by the movie &#34;John Carter&#34; and decided to read all these books, since they were free on my Kindle.

It's the first in a series of stories about the red planet. We first meet our hero John Carter in the wild west. For some reason he is transported to Mars. Here he meets the incomparable Dejah Thoris, his friend Tars Tarkas. We learn that Mars has many types of inhabitants who, living on Mars don't get along with each other. We also learn that Mars is a dieing planet.The story has all the elements of a typical adventure story: a damsel in distress, the knight in white shining armour, foes to be defeated. As this is the first in a series, Carter is essentially a one dimensional character with all the attributes we expect our hero to possess. That being said we turn the pages as we follow our hero on his adventures. The book ends with a cliffhanger: does Dejah Thoris survive? will all the inhabitants of Mars survive?The book is much better than the film version. And what may be unfortunate is that the film will deter readers from reading \\"A Princess of Mars\\".

John Carter our hero hails from Virginia, he is a southern gentleman, fought for the Confederate Army, and tolerates no cowardice or fear from himself. John Carter is straight up a mans man. He looks those vile green men of Mars straight in the eye everytime and when the dust settles he stands over their dead excusses of life one foot on their neck, sword in hand, naked except for the metal of those he wears after he frees their violent souls to their fathers of old. He does this because every drop of Virginian blood would allow no less then his own death for his Red Queen, the envy, the heart of every Martian man. From the start of this book to the end John Carter runs wild and takes over Mars. Nothing stands in his way. Not the white ape-men, the 10-16 foot green martians, or the wars between the red men of Mars. John Carter even tames the vicious, destructive beast of Mars. What he does not tame or befriend he leaves dead in his path. This book is true pulp fiction to the max. But it is one hell of a fun ride. There are some hoky things in the story, it is far from being perfect. However if you like Dirty Harry, Rambo, John McClane, Jason Bourne and James Bond then you will like this book. John Carter like the other guys I just listed always win. Hokey or not it is what it is. Fun, fast paced, and groovy. Old time sci-fi that is better than most new fiction out there today. As old as these stories are they were a breath of fresh air. At least thats my opinion. I have nothing bad to say about this book and I don't want to give to much away. You have to read this book to find out just how wonderful it is."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"A hero who thinks with his muscles, is a little scared of women, and exemplifies valor without reflection.

Imagine my delight when I finally read \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and found it just as fun as the first time! Don't get me wrong. There is nothing profound here, no literary brilliance for the ages or anything like that. The \\"science\\" of the science fiction here is often questionable, though it helps to keep in mind that some of the sillier-sounding things were not so far-fetched when it was written. But if you want a good, clean, fast-paced adventure you can do a lot worse than this, and the numerous sequels. There is little excess verbiage, unlike most modern action novels I've tried, and you will probably tear through this and want more.One thing I'll point out is the airship warfare depicted in the novels. Today it sounds quaint. Before they were displaced by airplanes, the airships really were terrors of the skies, just as lethal as the book depicts. Imagine those cute Goodyear blimps overhead, raining down fire and death instead of running ads, and you will have some appreciation of the potential of airships in a world without heavier-than-air flying machines."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"\\"I have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until I have passed over for eternity.

The train was a kind of a \\"great beast\\" that was \\"westering.\\" But then the train reached the edge of the sea, and it stopped. The grandson, Jody, asks whether there might not be lands beyond the sea where one can wester. The grandfather sadly shakes his head. No, there aren't any more lands, he says. But what is worse, westering has gone out of people today. Nobody _wants_ to wester anymore. The story is at once a marvelous mythical farewell to the Old West and a comment on the nature of the modern world.When Edgar Rice Burroughs serialized his first novel, _Under the Moons of Mars_, in _Argosy_ in 1912 under the pseudonym of \\"Norman Bean,\\" the American frontier was, for all practical purposes, closed. Not everybody knew it yet, but the westering movement was over. A number of American pulp writers known as the scientific romance writers were looking for new frontiers to explore: lost valleys and cities, underground caverns, distant planets, the interior of the atom, the jungles of Africa, the inside of the Earth or the Moon, a city lost in time, another galaxy. These settings were intended to be colorful new worlds where lurid and romantic adventures could occur-- at least in the reader's imagination.The scientific romancers -- A. Merritt, Ray Cummings, H. Bedford-Jones, Otis Adelbert Kline, Austin Hall, Homer Eon Flint, Garrett P. Serviss, Charles B. Stilson, and Burroughs--were essentially popular writers. My personal candidates for the two best American scientific romancers are Merritt and Bedford-Jones, but none can seriously be considered underrated literary geniuses. Burroughs has certainly proved to be the most popular over time, and _A Princess of Mars_ ( the book title of _Under the Moons of Mars_ )may be taken as almost the archetype of the scientific romance.It starts in the American west in 1865, right after the Civil War. Captain John Carter of Virginia, C.S.A. and a friend are prospecting for gold. They have good luck with the gold but bad luck with Apache warriers. The friend is killed and Carter enters a cave and is transported to Mars. In effect, he leaves the old frontier for the new. There he finds a new collective beast on the other side of the ocean of space. It is not a westering wagon train; rather, it is a tribe of green Martian warriers. The Martians look very much alike. Their young are hatched in incubators and are raised communally, without knowing their parents. Weak or deformed young are promptly shot. The green Martians are taught at an early age to use weapons and to scorn weakness and sentiment. A typical Martian woman tells the kindly female Sola:\\"It is sad, Sola, that you were not born a million years ago...when all the hollows of the land were filled with water, and the peoples were as soft as the stuff they sailed upon. In our day, we have progressed to a point where such sentiments mark weakness and atavism.\\" (49)But in spite of the unified values of the beast, there are signs that it may change. The tender Sola, the faithful watchdog Woola, and even the formidable warrier Tars Tarkas seem poised to lead the way to something else. When John Carter and Dejah Thoris become prisoners of the tribe, they speed up a change in the values of the beast. It will retain its unity, but its head will become different.There is much in the book that is silly. But there is a certain amount of color and good fun as well."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is easily Edgar Rice Burroughs' best book and one of the most influential novels ever written. From beginning to end, the narrative pumps with intelligence, social commentary, romance, and action. Though archetypes, the main characters take on distinct personalities and become more than just ciphers on a page. To anyone looking for good reading in a unique world, read this and its sequels. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I haven't sat down to watch the movie yet, but I thought I would take another look at the source material.Well, it is still a great book. The only thing is that it has been ripped off by so many other franchises.The only problem with the book is Burroughs insistence on creating as many alien races as he can. The amount often becomes bewildering, and this is a problem that a lot of his other work had. I remember becoming lost when reading the people that time forgot - there seemed to be so many creatures and races, that I couldn't keep up.Still, there is a lot to admire in this book, and you will be very entertained by it."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"\\"I have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until I have passed over for eternity.

YIKES !!!When I saw that, I expected PULPY and a bit on the lousy side. So I gritted my teeth, and loaded it up, and went and hit the links (I listened to this while golfing)So after all that I have to say this was pretty terrific, and not really pulpy at all. There is stuff much more recent that would be hard pressed to match the style and quality of the writing here.Without giving the whole story away, our hero, John Carter ends up on Barsoom / Mars and proceeds to meet the locals, gets in some fights, save the girl and all that jazz.The action is fast paced, but not such a blur as to get pulpy. The writing is so eloquent. That might be the biggest surprise to me, was that the writing was so eloquent, but without getting to the point of being too flowery. And in no way (to me at least) did the style or tone seem dated.Without a doubt this was a very pleasant surprise, I cant wait to read the next one. Maybe golfinng again tomorrow."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This \\"classic\\" pulp sci-fi from 1917 is good hokey fun. It tells the story of Civil War veteran John Carter who is transported to Mars, a planet whose natives are engaged in constant warfare. John Carter's soldier training and muscles adapted to earth's stronger gravity make him a nearly superhuman warrior on Mars as he fights his way through dangers at every turn. There are plenty of convenient coincidences, some cheesy (but chaste) romance, and lots of over-the-top action... just take it all in stride as part of the genre and this is a fun mindless sci-fi read."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book is well worth the read.

What appeals to me most about this book is that you can take a look into what people from the early 1900's imagined what Mars could be like; Burroughs gave Mars the appearance of a highly futuristic planet filled with many types of people and inventions that seem impossible to see in reality. If you enjoy action, a bit of romantic heroism, and a look into what potentially could exist in the galaxy, then this is certainly the right book for you."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Originally published 1912 in a magazine serial. (1917 in book form)Since the movie John Carter is coming out in a couple of months I decided to go back and re-read the original of the 11 books that Burroughs (1875-1950) wrote about Mars (or, as he calls it, Barsoom).I originally read the entire series, or at least most of it, nearly 30 years ago, when I was in high school. I must admit, I was struck by the art of Michael Whelen's cover more than anything else when I first picked it up and my circle of friends read at least some of them.I remembered them fondly but found myself very vague on the specifics. I remembered the Princess was very beautiful and there were multiple races on Mars and that some had four arms and that Carter, a former Confederate soldier, traveled from Earth to Mars in some kind of psychic manner and that there was a lot of fighting.Turns out, what I took as a poor memory was actually pretty accurate. The Princess is beautiful, there are multiple races of Martians and the green Martians have four arms and Carter does travel to Mars in some sort of psychic way. I had totally forgotten that it happens while he is being hunted by a group of Apache in Arizona at the time, but that really is not germane to the rest of the story.The story is supposed to be the writings of John Carter himself (who is ageless and cannot remember his childhood). Carter told his nephew not to publish it until he had been dead for 21 years. The plot is mostly Carter's descriptions of his adventures told in first person with little conversation. There are lots and lots of battle scenes since Mars is a very violent place. Then again, Earth is not much better with Carter making a name for himself in the Civil War and in the first few pages being involved in a running battle with the Apache.Short on character development and long on description and action, A Princess of Mars was not as good as I remembered it but I am very impressed with Burroughs and his imagination. In a time before science fiction was a normal part of the national psyche, he created an entirely new world, peopled it with aliens with new customs, languages and animals and made the world work in an interesting way. Some of his science is rather silly (the generator that creates the Martian atmosphere comes to mind), but it is a classic and a trendsetter."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"A Princess of Mars introduces John Carter, a Civil War soldier and Southern gentleman who heads west to seek his fortune when his beloved South falls. There, he strikes gold but, before he and his partner can mine their claim, they are set upon by a band of ferocious Indians. Carter seeks refuge in a cage which he discovers too late is full of a poisonous gas that paralyzes him. In awe, he watches as his soul separates from his body and then, in a flash, finds himself transported to Mars, where he spends the next ten years. This first book in the series recounts his first experiences on the red planet and his encounters with its three main humanoid species: the green barbarians who live only to die in ferocious battles and have lost all sense of human kindness and love, the more human-like red men who have returned to the intellectual and emotional characteristics of their ancestors and their common enemy, the malevolent great apes. Carter is grieved by the baseness of the green monsters but sees glimpses of promise in a few of them, including the kind-hearted Sola and the rough warrior Tars Tarkas. The beautiful cities they inhabit - once the homes of the ancient, more civilized Martians - are taken for granted and serve only as a sad backdrop to the pitiful, deadly existence of their people. In contrast, he finds much to appreciate and admire in the red men...especially in the beautiful princess he rescues from a certain death, setting the stage for the remainder of the series.My brother has nagged me to read this book for ages and, when I found it for free as a Kindle e-book, I finally broke down and gave it a try. Reminiscent of C. S. Lewis' Space Trilogy, it is an entertaining and fast read with just the right blend of action, history and philosophy. The characters are likable (especially my favorite, Sola) and the fictionalized history of Mars is well-plotted and interesting. Though I'd say that the Lewis trilogy (at least two of the books) are much better written, I still found this book a nice weekend read and, like my brother, would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"After seeing a preview of the upcoming movie version of this book, I went back to the basement and got my old copy out to read it again. It is still a wonderful piece of classic escapism adventure, when one filters out the prejudices of the era."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I had heard a lot of people talking about this classic novel and assumed it must be good... I was very wrong.The Princess of Mars is a novella that suffers from two main weak points: its characters are completely under developed, and it has an incredibly slow pace, although it does have an interest premise.The novella introduces its protagonist, John Carter, who narrates the story, however, instead of depicting characters with description and dialogue, he simply tells you what every has said (for the most part). This was not uncommon for books written at the time, but in many other novels of the time the characters at least have interesting personality traits, and are given a lot more dialogue. The result of such a lack of character means that readers will have a lot of difficulty relating to the characters, and getting emotionally involved in the story.Flaw #2 is the pacing, as noted above. The novella drones on (although its only around 160 pages) as once again the writer choose to tell the reader about what happens in the story, rather than explain with detail and action.The books only positive attributes is the setting: a dieing planet dotted with isolated city-states, and also home to nomadic hordes of giant savages.If The Princess of Mars was written in the modern era then perhaps it would have been written differently, however, it is instead an obsolete piece of science fiction that is not worth reading."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"\\"A Princess of Mars\\" was a great adventure and a fun story. Burroughs created various alien cultures and creatures that fire the imagination. I particularly loved Woola, the loyal monster-doggie. Although I'm a big fan of pulp sci-fi, my lower rating is due to a couple of issues that were off-putting to me. 1) The nearly magical way that Carter kept extricating himself from dire situations was exceedingly unlikely, 2) Carter comes off as a braggart trying to appear humble, and 3) and the archaic view of women grated on me. While I don't think I could take a steady diet of these, I do appreciate Burroughs' creativity, which was ahead of his time. He is certainly one of the fathers of sci-fi and it is likely that I'll read the other books in the series at some point in time. One slightly off-topic thought: I had an ah-ha moment while I was reading this book and thought to myself \\"Well now I see where Heinlein got his ideas from.\\" It seems that Burroughs is the original genius behind many of the sci-fi concepts adopted by Heinlein, but without the gratuitous sex that Heinlein throws in."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I read these stories when I was in high school, and I quite enjoyed them. ERB's Barsoom tales are a wonderful series, and make fantastic escapist entertainment, but have to admit, even back when I first read the books, I never entirely warmed to the character of John Carter himself, or of Dejah Thoris, and I enjoyed far more the books in the series where these two were not the primary characters (e.g. \\"The Mastermind of Mars,\\" \\"A Fighting Man of Mars,\\" \\"Llana of Gathol). Not only were those later books written after Burroughs was a bit more polished as a writer, the real problem is that JC and DT are, to put it bluntly, appallingly one-dimensional characters. They have NO flaws whatever. John Carter in particular, is what people call, in modern parlance, a \\"Mary Sue\\" character -- an overly idealized character, lacking any significant flaws or weaknesses, and constituting a pretty obvious a wish-fulfilment fantasy for the author. (The name comes from a story written as an intentional parody of this type of character, which is especially prevalent in amateur fan fiction.)In \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" John Carter lands amongst the savages, but immediately impresses them with his prowess at absolutely everything. In no time at all -- mere days -- he's learned their language, defeated several of their best warriors, taught them new and better ways to control their domestic animals, and won the status of a high mucky muck among them. His origin on Earth, with three times the gravity of Mars, makes him superhumanly strong, he's immune to the natives' telepathy (but can read their minds at will), and is literally (according to a passage in chapter one) incapable of feeling the emotion of fear. He never does anything that even sails withing shouting distance of being selfish, self-serving, or dishonorable in any way whatever. And since the story is told from the first person perspective, it makes him sound like a truly insufferable braggart. He never makes a serious mistake through the entire series (his worst one, unintentionally offending Dejah Thoris, out of ignorance of Martian customs, is soon put right), Before the end of the third chapter, it has been fully conveyed to the reader that, no matter what, Carter is not at risk of serious injury, failure or death. This makes it really hard to care about the character; after all, it's not like Carter is going to ever have to overcome a failing or character flaw (he doesn't have any), and there's no sense at all that his plight might be the same as yours would be if you could somehow be put in his place, because there is never ANY feeling whatever that he will make a bad decision, even by accident or out of ignorance. And this aspect of the character never improves in subsequent novels; in fact it gets worse, on more than one occasion he states -- it's first person, remember -- that he is unquestionably the greatest swordsman who has ever lived. Not just of his era, or in living memory, or anything like that, but EVER. The result is that there is no sense of challenge, no credible threat that ever seems to genuinely endanger the character, and likewise, there is no sympathy for the reader to feel with a human character, no need for character development and no sense that the character will ever grow as a person through adversity, after all, he's perfect already.And all this is real pity, because other aspects of this book, and the subsequent volumes, are first rate. Sure it's a scientifically ludicrous fantasy, but it's entertaining, and if you suspend disbelief, you may lose yourself in one of the all time great settings for exciting, adventure fiction: lots of ancient ruins, warring city-states, vast stretches of unexplored wilderness, different races, exotic locales, etc..Of course, it's still pulp writing, so one shouldn't be expecting anything other than escapist entertainment. The best installments in the series supply this, but the sheer weight of John Carter's one-dimensionality drags down the books which feature him as the main character."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"After seeing the preview for the new John Carter movie, I decided to go back and reread the Edgar Rice Burroughs, \\"Mars\\" series. I'm glad I did. The thrilling tales of battle, adventure, and love on the red planet are just as great as I remembered them. John Carter is a fantastic hero and his name should be right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, Drizzt D'ourdan, and Han Solo.A Princess of Mars"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I'm not sure if Princess of Mars is responsible for defining pulp science fiction, what I am sure of is that it was a great stepping stone for later authors such as Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke. Honestly, I wasn't sure of what I was getting into with this book. I've seen it listed a few times on \\"Top (x) Sci Fi Books\\" lists and since its public domain I was able to get it for free on my Kindle. What a ride!John Carter is prospecting for gold in the Arizona desert when suddenly he is being chased by a bunch of Indians. He seeks refuge in a cave and when he is eventually discovered by the Indians, they run away from the cave in fear. Suddenly he is transported to Mars (known as 'Barsoom' to its inhabitants) where he is met by an aggressive breed of large, 4-armed, green, war-loving Martians called Tharks. He quickly proves himself worthy because of his great strength (because of gravitational differences between Earth and Mars). Soon he is on a mission to save the Princess of Helium whom was captured by the Tharks during a surprise attack.Once the stage is set this novel moves FAST! This is a short, ferocious read. The characters are clich&eacute;d, the story is predictable and often a bit sappy, the Martian backdrop is inconsequential, however, the writing is highly entertaining and above all this is just darn fun.

The transportation to Mars is ridiculous but, regardless of this fact its a great book.To bad you can't get it here"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"My Advanced Placement English teacher recommended that we try and find and read the Martian Tales of ERB. I took his advice and I currently own all of them in hardback, with no intention of selling them . . . ever. But I disagree that this book and the following books are the best in science fiction. For the time, I'm sure that they were great, but now they're a little bit in vogue. The main reason why I read them is because I wanted to see what my teacher meant when he said, &quot;This is the original Star Wars.&quot; Or at least part of it. You'll find parallels throughout the series. Jed = Jedi, etc. But when I compare this one book to Dune or any book by Philip K. Dick, or any short story by Harlan Ellison, there is no way I could give this book more than three stars. Admittedly, the first book might be different and refreshing after reading tons of fight-the-alien-hordes colonize-the-planet type of books. But when you read more of the series, you'll see that these are pretty much formula stories, and that detracts from the books reread value. You read one, you've almost read them all. There's a character named Dejah Thoris. It seems that she's almost always getting kidnapped or her hero is getting into trouble. After a while you get a sense of Dejah vu, if you know what I mean. ERB will put his character in a cell or something and with a leap and a bound he jumps out of the pit, grabs the dangling rope with his right arm while catching the screaming, falling Dejah Thoris in his left, and dodging bullets at the same time. No, that doesn't happen in THIS book. But at least you know now, how he sometimes writes. These books are simply too predictable to give more than 3 stars. With so few characters, you KNOW the good guy isn't going to die. Basically, if you like pulp fiction, formula stories, star wars, etc. this is a good book and a good series. But I wouldn't say that it's the best."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I randomly fell upon this book while looking through a recommended reading list and realized the new Disney movie \\"John Carter\\" is based this book. I generally cannot stand to watch a movie before I've read the book, so I decided to read it.The basic plot (with no spoilers) involves a typical heroic character who is mysteriously transported to Mars where he immediately becomes a captive of the first aliens he meets: the ferocious, war-mongering Green Men of Mars. While in captivity, and throughout the book, he proves he is a ferocious warrior (mostly due to his exceptional strength and jumping abilities given the low gravity of Mars). At times this ability becomes too \\"deus ex machina\\" for my liking, but you gotta stay alive somehow among horribly barbaric Martians who are 15+ feet tall. Eventually he meets his Martian Princess (she's a Red Martian, though, and they are much more like Earth humans) and falls madly in love with her, presumably because she is just so unimaginably beautiful and loved by all. The remainder of the story is essentially his efforts to conquer the world just so he can be hers and she can be his.The writing style certainly falls into that of the early 1900s and I find it rather charming. In fact, anything I do like about this book is more based on it's charm rather than it being particularly excellent or deep.Although the love story is somewhat cliched, there is something \\"pure\\" about it, like how much he adores her and she doesn't have to do anything to earn his love in the first place (or keep it), and how his love seems to have nothing to do with sex or sexual desires--simply he adores her. Perhaps unrealistic and fairy-tale-ish, but still dear in its own way.Although I do find the writing style and parts of the love-conquers-all plot charming, overall I'm not sure I would recommend this book. Of course, some people are huge fans of this genre... A friend of mine in college certainly would have adored this book, cliched plot and all =)"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a science-fiction book published in 1912. This is Burroughs first published book and stars John Carter.John Carter, a Civil War Confederate veteran, finds himself projected to Mars. Discovering he has enormous strength and agility due to the lower force of gravity, Carter rises to a high position in the Tharks tribe. The Tharks are nomadic green Martians who have six limbs.Soon the Tharks capture the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris who is a member of the red Martians which are a humanoid race. The red Martians live in city-states and control Mars' canals and agriculture. John Carter saves Dejah Thoris but becomes embroiled in Martian politics.Eventually, Carter leads a horde of Tharks against Zodanga, a city-state of the red Martians and historic enemy of Helium. This act of valor wins John Carter the hand of Dejah Thoris and he becomes Prince of Helium. The happy couple lives joyfully for nine years when a breadown of the Atmosphere Plant threatens to destroy all life on Mars. Carter uses a telepathic code to enter the factory with engineers who can restore it to working conditions. However, Carter soon becomes asphyxiated and awaken back on Earth wandering what happened to his beloved and his people.A Princess of Mars is Edgar Rice Burroughs' first novel, while the novel is good, it feels like a first novel and I'm glad Burroughs continued to write and get better each time.What impressed me about the book was how imaginative it was compared to other science-fiction stories of the time. While Jules Verne concentrated on the science aspect of his stories and H.G. Wells' science fiction stories were more about social commentary, Burroughs concentrated more on the story aspect, but instead of taking place on earth, he set it on Mars.The book is an escapable fantasy, and enjoyable tale which, if set on earth, could have been easily been classified as pulp fiction. A Princess of Mars is very imaginative with lots of action, alien culture, romance and chivalry.While I certainly enjoyed many of Burroughs' later novels (Tarzan of the Apes comes immediately to mind), this book is on a different level entirely. While I found Tarzan of the Apes to be complex, involving and even philosophical, A Princess of Mars is a silly joyride, full of action with wonderful narrative.I know what you're saying to yourself: \\"he read this just to capitalize on the release of the new John Carter movie\\".And I'd say: \\"good observation, Captain Obvious\\".I did read this book because the movie is coming out, and I hope you do too. I'm glad Disney decided to rejuvenate this old series, bring Burroughs back into the spotlight and have a new generation of readers enjoy his tales."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I'd been aware of the John Carter saga for some time, long before the movie came out in 2011. Despite my fondness for this kind of fiction, I'd never read any of the stories, I think because I held in my mind an odd and inaccurate association with the author's other franchise, Tarzan. I knew they were different and separate creations, but my dislike for Tarzan ignorantly colored my view of the author's other works. I realized I had to disassociate the story lines, and take a chance on the Barsoom series on its own merits.I'm glad I did! I devoured this book in a day or two and enjoyed it immensely. What's to like?* an interesting (and original) premise;* good, solid characters;* smart, fast-paced writing;* lots of action;* a compelling story.Some will complain about the dated-ness of the books (especially the idea that some scientists once considered Mars habitable), but I found no trouble in accepting the story as told. It's fiction and it's fun. I consider the underlying social tones of the story to be as pertinent today as they were when Burroughs wrote it in 1911.If you enjoy original science fiction, take a chance on John Carter. I suspect most people will be like me and find themselves pleasantly surprised, even wondering what took them so long to take the plunge."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book (and the rest of the series) created the genre. To think this book was written 100 years ago amazes me. Yes, the story is simplistic in today's terms, the characters are a bit 1 dimensional but overall, the complexity of the world he created and the images he paints are fantastic. This is no Lord of the Rings but then again...it wasn't intended to be.The is a fun story with the universal theme of good vs evil. The protagonist really can't do any wrong and ends up with the woman at the end. Much of the terminology is a bit dated and/or doesn't even commonly exist in our current vocabulary but that also makes it more interesting.I read the story quickly, felt fulfilled in where it took me, and wanted to read more...what more can you ask for in a story?"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I love old books, and this is exactly what this release from LOA has done right; capturing the original beauty of the book from the time period. It looks and feels like a mint edition find from a local bookstore. The best part I love about this story is it's the COMPLETE RELEASE. Disney's publications of these books have left out a crucial point to the story: The introduction Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote about obtaining the manuscripts that added such a great detail beyond the actual story. Just a little something, but I'm glad this edition has it included as well as a wonderful introduction by Junot Diaz. Any book lover will wish to add this to their collection."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I watched the John Carter trailer, not for the first time, and my interest was rekindled in the movie. The trailer does not impress me, but the history behind the story and the movie does. This flick has been in pre-production for 90 years. It could have been the first animated feature-length movie ever. By Disney.And so!I went on Amazon and got A Princess of Mars for free.First Impressions:This book is really good so far. But that's probably because I'm associating Tars Tarkus with my favorite superhero, J'onn J'onzz, who ironically is from Mars and has a doppelganger named Jars Jarkus.January 2012:Avatar ripped off everything from this book. Right down to the Indian allusions.J'onn and his martian homeworld in DC comics was also shamelessly taken from this book.I mean, yeah, some books are like \\"they stole this!\\" , but this genre and story is so OUT THERE that really, is there any doubt?Nonetheless, I like all three iterations.This book was really great- the predecessor to everything. It was a total cliffhanger, so I need to get started on The Warlords of Mars.This book is not hard to read or get into. The constant \\"as I learned later\\" is sort of annoying, but John's humility and general likeability as a hero make up for all the slow parts full of vivid description. Many of the scenes I could imagine in mind's eye just because of the similar movie scenes I've encountered. As with the Hobbit, I felt like I had read this story before, because I HAVE, just in different formats rehashed by different authors in new ways.This book is worth the read! It's also super clean (unless you don't like slight warrior-epic violence), so I would recommend it to sixth graders and up."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Despite the 'classic' old-fashioned structure to the prose, I couldn't put the book down. Burroughs glosses over quite a bit of the world I would have liked to see more fully explored but I'm hoping that these details will come as the series unfolds. I also wish he'd taken more time to develop John Carter and not rushed the ending as I feel he did but this is only book 1 of many.I'm so glad I read this (thank you Disney for providing the impetus) and will definitely be reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"John Carter's adventures were a highlight of mine when I was in high school. Reading it again, some twenty years later, it was just as exciting and fun as the first time.Truly, a must read for all fans of fantasy and science fiction."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1st, 1875 - March 19, 1950) was a writer of adventure series, including, of course Tarzan, but also the Barsoom series, of which this is the first novel. \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was written between July and October of 1911, and published in \\"All-Story\\" as a six-part serial from February through July of 1912. It then was published in book form in October of 1917. This novel and series may have been inspired by \\"Lieutenant Gullivar Jones: His Vacation\\" a novel from 1905 by Edwin Lester Arnold, and the character John Carter was perhaps in part derived from Phra, a hero in Arnold's \\"The Wonderful Adventures of Phra the Phoenician\\" from 1890. However, this is no copy of either of those works. \\"Phra\\" was closer in tone, but virtually unreadable, and \\"Gullivar Jones\\" was a very light and almost comedic series of adventures and so is not very similar in feel to this work.The story actually opens with a foreword written by Burroughs where the claim is made that the story is true, and information is given about what happened to John Carter, leaving it open ended. The story is written as if a memoir written by John Carter itself. From the start, it is understood that Carter is no normal person, as he has lived countless years, and yet remains young in appearance. A very abbreviated setup is given about him serving the Confederacy in the Civil War and about his and another Confederate looking for gold in Arizona, but this is not the story which is to be told. All that and the chase by the Indians and his getting lost and finding a mysterious cave, is just the setup. It is quickly resolved, in a way, and he finds himself transported to Mars where no time is wasted and he immediately encounters the green Martians--a tribe called the Tharks, and though he cannot communicate effectively, he ends up safe, though a prisoner.Burroughs effectively gives the reader the information about this alien society in an entertaining and interesting way. He is able to inform the reader about the type of society Carter is being held in, as well as move the story along with action sequences and the introduction and capture of the more human red Martian Princess Dejah Thoris to which the title of the book refers. It is no surprise that Carter is taken with the Princess and resolves to help her. He defends her at great risk to his life, which gains him more status with the Tharks, but he also learns that her and his fate are likely to be death by torture, so he plans to escape with her. The escape, when it does come is not as successful, and Carter finds that he has to sacrifice himself in order for the Princess to have a chance at escape. This leaves him at the mercy of yet another tribe, the Warhoons.There are interesting characters in this book as well, starting with John Carter himself. There is also Sola, a female Thark who is more human than any of the others in her tribe; the Princess Dejah Thoris for whom John Carter falls, and who falls for him as well; Tars Tarkas, the Thark warrior that Carter makes a friend and ally; and Kantos Kan, the Red Martian who helps John Carter save his Princess. Their main foe is the Thark female Sarkoja, who plays a significant role in Sola's past as well as thwarting all the heroes plans repeatedly. There are also foes in the form of vast armies, such as the Warhoons and the Zodangans.There are similarities between the two works by Edwin Lester Arnold and Burrough's work. The long life and coming back from death is something that Carter shares with Phra. The quick trip to Mars is shared with Gullivar Jones, though he made via a magic carpet and expressing a wish, while Carter simply focused on Mars after his mysterious experience in the cave. Arnold handled the learning of the language in a mind dump, while Burroughs simply had it easy to learn, but in both cases it appears that a common language is used throughout Mars. Arnold had a river of the dead, while Burroughs writes of the river Iss from which none return.The weakest part of the book is the ending. Burrough's spends the majority of the book on a relatively short period of time, filling in the last 9+ years in the second to last chapter, with the last chapter being a very short wrap-up. The final crisis feels manufactured and doesn't really fit in with the rest of the story. One can easily ignore this weakness though, and ultimately this book is still a very strong start to the series."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Take a brawny Virginian adventurer, and get him to the Red Planet.

Its amazing to note that he wrote this in 1912. The science sounds plausible and for those items where he can't nail things down he has the 9 rays of the sun to account for anti gravity and an atmosphere generator to overcome the problems of Mars atmosphere. As for John Carters transport to Mars, I don't know if future novels attempt to explain that but I am going with the initial transit due to something in that cave where the knock out / paralysis gas (?) overcame him. After that he is transported back one can assume in much the same fashion as Star Trek like transporters. Perhaps its all due to some mad scientist sort of overlord trying to utilize heavy gravity earth man to kick start a stagnant society. He is perhaps called back and returned due to a tracking implant within his body. Obviously at the height of Martian culture hundreds of thousands of years ago they may have achieved nuclear power but I am willing to overlook that that has been lost or perhaps become culturally unacceptable knowledge In the end if you respect the story and are a little awed at his guesses, mad and otherwise, at building his novels Mars back in 1912. Mr. Burroughs was at the dawn of flight and we only had inklings of the power of radium and there weren't even diving tanks for scuba diving yet..I loved the wireless guided explosive bullet rifle, enjoyed the enormous flying battleships powered by antigravity, the mention of powerful telescopes that inform them of the Earth and in a couple of ways that shall go unmentioned I dug the well nigh impregnable fortress for the atmosphere generator.This is a fast paced novel and within the first 30 pages much has happened and you know a number of things about mars. So hang on tight and enjoy the ride and though written in 1912 you will be impressed."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is the first novel in the adventures of John Carter on Mars (#1 in the Barsoom series), where Mars is referred to as Barsoom.

Any serious student of science fiction literature should be very familiar with the series. The story opens up in 1865. The U. S.

Carter's friend dies and he finds himself cornered inside a cave. Carter awaits the final attack but is perplexed when the Indians fail to do so. Moments later, Carter finds himself transported from Arizona to the desert sea bottoms of Mars, called Barsoom by its natives (this transportation to Mars via a type of astral projection or teleportation was an early example of such transportation methods appearing in science fiction literature). Carter soon finds that he has great leaping abilities and comes in contact with tall, green, nomadic warriors with six limbs. He also finds humans like himself, albeit with red skin and more advanced scientifically. Carter soon befriends a captive red woman, named Dejah Thoris, who is a princess of Helium.

Paradise!I was lucky enough to have the hardbound edition illustrated by Frank Frazetta. The reviewer who said that the modern cover illustrations are too risque compared to the earlier covers obviously never SAW the earlier covers.

If you wish to read it as an ebook, get the free Kindle version here on Amazon or download it from Project Gutenberg. ***\\"World Building\\" is the term for modern fantasy and sci fi writers who take great lengths to create fictional cultures and civilizations, and then immerse their readers in them.They all learned it from such efforts as Edgar Rice Burroughs \\"Mars\\" series. As you read this book, you'll actually sort of wonder why the Mars Rovers didn't come across the peoples and civilizations described, and you'll feel a bit sad that they did not.Burroughs describes two societies, one somewhat different than our own, and one completely different. He includes animals, races, social customs, and physiology that were far ahead of his time in terms of literary imagination. Of course, his books were written, self admitedly, as pulp. There are flaws in plotting and some cliche in character development, but these are quickly washed away by the compelling story and the struggles of the hero to survive, and to help those natives of Mars for whom he has come to care.If you somehow missed these books before, they are good reads, for either older children or adults with a taste for the fanciful. The first few of the series have fallen into the public domain, and you can obtain them for free either here on Amazon for your Kindle, or from places like Project Gutenberg as text files.The first three books comprise a trilogy: A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and Warlord of Mars.

There, he impresses the giant green Tharks with his hand-to-hand combat skills, falls in love with Princess Dejah Thoris, and has many adventures. Very fun escapist yarn. Totally implausible, but never really asks you to take it seriously. Pure wish-fulfillment heroic fantasy. Burroughs' prose is a bit archaic and stilted, and some plot twists were too extraordinary to be satisfying. Overall, however, Princess is very entertaining pulp fiction."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"In 1912, before such a thing as science fiction existed as a separate genre, I'm not sure how the serial in All-Story called \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\", by \\"Norman Bean\\", was received. Probably simply as an adventure story, one that hearkened back pretty clearly to the lost race tales of the likes of H. Rider Haggard. (And to be sure at about the same time Edgar Rice Burroughs was publishing the first of his Tarzan stories, which much more overtly can be placed in the \\"lost race\\" lineage.) \\"Norman Bean\\", of course, was a pseudonym for Edgar Rice Burroughs, and in 1917 \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\" was reprinted in book form as _A Princess of Mars_, under Burroughs' own name.How necessary is it to describe the plot of _A Princess of Mars_? Briefly, Civil War veteran (for the South) Colonel John Carter and a friend discover a gold mine in Arizona. They run afoul of Indians, and while hiding in a cave, Carter is mysteriously transported to Mars. There he encounters the rather brutish \\"Green Martians\\", and is taken captive by them. They are constantly battling each other, and the rather more civilized (and humanoid, though egg-laying) \\"Red Martians\\". They capture a Princess of the Red Martians, the beautiful Dejah Thoris. After a rocky start, John Carter and Dejah Thoris fall in love. The leader of the Green Martians plans terrible tortures for them, so it becomes necessary to escape. They become separated, and Carter makes his way to a rival city of Dejah Thoris's. He and a friend plot to undo the dastardly plans of this rival city, and rescue Dejah Thoris's city, which they do in very adventurous fashion. By the end, John Carter has managed to effect positive political change among both the Red Martians and Green Martians, and he and Dejah Thoris are husband and wife, awaiting the hatching of a child, when a crisis in the air-manufacturing plant intervenes.The whole thing is a wild mess of faintly plausible SFnal ideas, totally ridiculous SFnal ideas, and pure fantasy. Much is absurd, but much is really fun. The writing is rather stilted but occasionally striking. The characters are very stiff. The attitudes are consistent with the time -- the references to Indians are pretty racist, and there is no reason to believe that the Confederate John Carter would be any more admirable in his attitudes toward black people, but on the whole these aspects are much in the background. It can't be regarded as a great book, but it remains appealing."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is one of those books that helped define science fiction and fantasy, back in the days when the genre didn't take itself so seriously as it does today. It isn't great literature, nor should it be read as such. Rather, &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; sets down on the page a fantasy common to teenage boys (and no small number of adult men), that they may be whisked off to a world where moral choices are simple, fair maidens await rescue, and legendary battles are to be fought with nefarious foes.John Carter is a virtuous, passionate hero, and in the end he triumphs over all adversity, never admitting defeat. Improbable? No matter; his story is still entertaining and keeps you engaged. He makes Mars his own and brings us along for the ride. It's a new world, fresh for exploration.This latter thing was what really drew me and held me in this book, and despite all we know about Mars today still makes &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and its sequels worth reading. Over every red hill is a new adventure, a new, alien city, a fantastic machine or loyal pet that makes the world worth saving. The excitement this can engender is best testified by all the books like Burroughs' Mars series that came later, seeking to duplicate its magic; John Norman's efforts before he became controversial are an excellent example. So read &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, and feel the excitement of being young again."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is the most mystical of all of Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. The hero, Captain John Carter of Virginia, can remember no childhood. As far back as he can recall he has always been a fighting man of about 30. While called \\"Uncle Jack\\" by the Carters, his exact connection to the family is uncertain. As a soldier of fortune, he has traveled the world in the service of \\"an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings.\\" He has fought with distinction in the War between the States, as well as, lived and fought with the Plains Indians on the frontier.It is while prospecting in the Arizona Territory that he runs afoul of Apaches and finds himself in the cave of a shaman. Here he undergoes what is obviously an out-of-the-body experience and transport to Mars, \\"god of my vocation.\\" This is a Mars of majestic dead seas and dead cities, as well as, warring city states and aerial dreadnought fleets. It is a Mars of many races and species, some honorable and some monstrous. Above all, it is a Mars of high adventure.Inspite of the fact that it was written in 1912, this story holds up. My mother, who was born in 1915 (right before the world started to go to hell) remembered my great aunt reading from this book ,aloud, on the front porch on summer evenings. That is why this audio version is such a great idea- this is the sort of tale, like Homer's, that demands to be told out loud on a quiet evening. Really, I do not think that a modern writer could recreate the style of this narrative. The themes of honor, loyalty, duty, courage, and friendship run too strong and too true. There is no modern cynicism and soul rot here."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Who could have imagined what lay in store for the literary world when Edgar Rice Burrougs first sold A Princess of Mars. It's been almost 90 years since then and he helped turn the entertainment world upside down. Maybe people think of Tarzan first when ERB's name is mentioned, but it was John Carter of Mars who sent generations of avid fans roaming the wilds of Barsoom in the shadow of Carter, the greatest swordsman of all time.Princess of Mars has the unenviable task of introducing the reader not only to the hero but also to the world of Barsoom. Everything must be explained and ERB does an extraordinary job of providing just enough details to keep the story flowing and whetting the readers' appetites for more.The only complaint a modern reader might have about the book is that the girl, Dejah Thoris, is a bit ornamental. And yet 90 years ago she was a breath-taking step into the future for literary audiences. ERB's light sensuality lent an air of sophistication to his writing which escapes most authors today, many of whom confuse sex scenes with entertainment and plotting. But the real beauty of the classic ERBian woman is that she has feelings and no matter how hard she tries to mask them she inevitably gives in to love provided the right suitor comes along.

From the hook in the opening framing device to the ending that demanded a sequel, \\"A Princess of Mars\\" delivers an imaginative world, culture, and philosophy that both draws from and contrasts with Earth society. Love, friendship, honor, courage, and familial bonds are handled in such a way that you only realize what Burroughs has revealed about them when you reflect upon the story afterwards.

Carter is a civil war era soldier that finds himself unexpectedly thrust into an adventure on the planet Barsoom (Mars). The main conflict of the story is as basic as good versus evil, but Burroughs weaves in a complex set of virtues expected of a hero. He masterfully blends a warrior's virtue of courage, strength, and honor with those of a moral man of compassion, love, and self-sacrifice. These virtues are demonstrated through the obstacles John Carter faces while struggling to survive on an alien planet. To save his princess Dejah Thorris, John Carter must overcome the brutal green hordes, the red army of Zodanga, and find a way to save the dying planet of Barsoom (Mars).Burroughs' \\"A Princess of Mars\\" is the first of a twelve book series all of which are enjoyable to read.

It reminded my of all the great stories I read/were read to me when I was a kid, and I'm glad to now be rounding out my frame of reference with it!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a classic, and perhaps one of the best Sci-fi books ever written. Are there more sophisticated sci-fi books out there? Sure. Are there more modern books that are more topical? Of course! But for sheer enjoyment and old-fasioned fun, A Princess of Mars is a CLASSIC. It may seem outdated, but then you have to realize it came before all the other stories and really is an original. See the movie- it is outstanding, and without question the most under rated film of 2012!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd, at least to me, but the rest of the story kept me interested.Since it's an older story, it's really great for adults like me who love \\"old-school\\" sci-fi. My son wasn't grabbed by it, by the way. So not sure if it's great for kids."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Just started reading this book and the rest of the series after recently watching the movie, mainly because I wanted to see what would happen next, and now I'm loving them completely and can't believe it has taken me so long to read them, after I had the chance a few years ago, but never bothered to do so. Loving them now though, and also loving the film was completely faithful too the books as there are still plenty of delightful surprises in amongst the pages."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Got into this after seeing the movie, it is a very well written and interesting series as all ways though the books bet the movie. However, unlike some interesting really enjoyed the movie adaptation and feels that it really didn't get the credit it deserves. But that usually happens when you are introducing a fairly unfamiliar character into the mainstream."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book is awesome. Brings back feelings of hope, love, and adventure. Great days of story telling that are long forgotten."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"These books are great if you like sci-fi, especially from early 20th Century when a lot of what we know today is still unproven or unknown.Don't judge this series on the ridiciulous movie Disney made. The books are PG-13 or even R and are much better constructed than the movie was."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I'll admit it freely- I only bought this book because of how desperately I fell in love with the recent Disney movie &#34;John Carter.&#34; I just had to read the original story, and I'm not disappointed. For the time period it was written in, A Princess of Mars is well beyond its time, and absolutely satisfies my need for good writing. The storyline is altered from the movie, but a good read nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoy this book and am regretful of not reading it sooner."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I loved the book (series) and thought the movie was great (5 stars)and now Scott Brick's audio version can be added to the 5 star collection. He has the perfect voice. He reads Burroughs very well which isn't easy to do. At least I sometimes have difficulty reading Burroughs until you get used to his style. This item is also available in MP3 format, however not all version show up during amazon searches. I done it several times and the MP3 version is the usual one that shows up. If you want the 6 CD set keep searching til you find it. Since this was released Scott Brick has also recorded audio versions of Book 2 (The Gods of Mars) and Book 3 (The Warlord of Mars). Same situation here, search for the version you want, either MP3 or traditional CD. they usually don't show up together. I have since order Scott Bricks - The Gods of Mars, and will review that after I have listened to it. You will not be disappointed in Scott Brick's telling of A Princess of Mars, although I must admit I am eager to hear a dramatized version with Scott Brick reading as John Carter. I'm glad I didn't get other readers version of the series, which I was tempted to do and my patience has paid off with Scott Brick's audio version of Books 2 and 3. I wonder if he will continue with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"If you were a fan of the Disney movie John Carter, then you will love this book, since it is the book the movie was based on. I have no idea why Disney changed the name.... probably because their version is only a pale shadow.

Excellent description of the culture and the society on Barsoom.

I loved the Tarzan series and John Carter didn't disappoint either. Look forward to the further adventures of John Carter."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs, well-known as the creator of \\"Tarzan,\\" was also a pioneer in the realm of science fiction. \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was originally written in serial form in 1912. The story is painted in broad strokes, with generous helpings of adventure, combat, and romance. The writing and dialogue sound quaint and stilted to modern ears, and the plot tends to meander. Borroughs' science may strike us today as a bit silly, but for 1912 it's very creative and imaginative. The detailed portrait of Martian society is fascinating.\\"A Princess of Mars\\" is a classic, and science fiction fans will enjoy it both for its curiosity quotient and its entertainment value."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"John Carter, a Civil War veteran, finds himself mystically transported to a Mars which is populated by all sorts of peculiar beings. Enslaved by giant, green barbarians who also respect him for his physical prowess, which has been enhanced by Mars's weaker gravity, Carter manages to survive despite overwhelming odds and win the hand of a beautiful princess. Obviously, this is not \\"The Sound and the Fury.\\" It is, however, a sterling example of escapist literature from a master of the \\"lost worlds\\" genre of fantasy."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a fascinating book from a fascinating series with each chapter drawing you into the story, and each book into the world of Barsoom. The book flows with a wonderful lure of suspense, action, and romance. The whole series is a fabulous work of literary art. The victorian style science fiction coupled with the writing skills of Mr. Burroughs hooked me the moment I started reading. After twenty plus years, still the most favored of my collection."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Almost 30 years ago, my Dad bought me the entire series. I read through &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; (my first novel) in three days at the age of 10. I read of the wonderful, fantastic adventures of John Carter, and was hooked--not just on Edgar Rice Burroughs, but also on science fiction, science, and, most importantly, reading.These books are not grandiose intellectual tomes. They are just pure fun! And that pure fun will inspire kids brought up with video games and Pokemon to go back to the basics and learn the joys of reading.Other reviews mention the need to get the second and third books in the series. I recommend you get them all. You'll never be satisfied until you're through them all, and then you'll be disappointed there are no more."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"The first Burroughs book I ever read, _A Princess of Mars_ still has the same power over me now that it did fifteen years ago. John Carter is the perfect hero, Dejah Thoris the perfect princess, and Tars Tarkas is the perfect loyal friend. Edgar Rice Burroughs rightly deserves the title of grandfather of modern science fiction. This is one truly magnificent, timeless adventure."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I would add only one thing to the previous reviews: Yes, this book is excellent. But no other book in modern times comes close! It is must reading for science fiction enthusiasts as well as others who wish to be swept off their feet. Barsoom awaits . . ."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I read this entire series and have never read high adventure written so well! A must for all people who feel they are science fiction or fantasy enthusiasts. The first three books are the best of this superior series."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"The book; classic (intelligent) pulp action/drama, one of the best. Edgar Rice Burroughs works are a joy to read and this book is no exception, the introduction however... so self-indulgent I had to write a comment! It was written by John Seelye who is the general editor of the Penguin Classics line. The piece is a rambling soapbox that goes on for twenty pages! It made me wonder whose book I was reading. John Seelye gives away endings to other great fiction, (War of the Worlds being one, another reason to skip the intro) he insults E.R.B.'s intelligence at least twice and for no reason his piece opens and closes with an attack on George Bush?! It was so nonsensical it was funny. Seriously, it doesn't matter which side of the isle you're on, is the intro to a Sci-fi book from 1912 the place for personal political views? Probably not. So skip the ranting, Tourette-like intro and enjoy one of E.R.B.'s most unique works (and the lovely Dejah Thoris, recommendation; Google search Adam Hughes, Dejah Thoris; wow). And Mr. Seelye, please, come on down from the box. ;)"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"What a wonderful imagination Edgar Rice Burroughs had. The Mars series; The Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, are three of the most enjoyable books, which I have ever read. For those who enjoy a good adventure, this series is a must read."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Long Live John Carter Warlord of MArs. When I was a kid and read this series, I wanted to be John Carter of Mars. Now I'm much older and still fascinated while rereading A Princess of MArs. Who can forget the opening part with John Carter lying in that Arizona cave and gazing at the strange red planet Mars while something behind him in the cave's darkness is stirring. What was that force that sent Carter to the red planet? And then there's his arrival in Mars and that strange green many-armed creature Tars Tarkas of the mighty green men of Thark. And then there's Dejah Thoris, the princess, a woman that words can't even begin to describe. What a babe. This book is still as good as it was back then. --Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, Sept 1999."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Who could have imagined what lay in store for the literary world when Edgar Rice Burrougs first sold A Princess of Mars. It's been almost 90 years since then and he helped turn the entertainment world upside down. Maybe people think of Tarzan first when ERB's name is mentioned, but it was John Carter of Mars who sent generations of avid fans roaming the wilds of Barsoom in the shadow of Carter, the greatest swordsman of all time.Princess of Mars has the unenviable task of introducing the reader not only to the hero but also to the world of Barsoom. Everything must be explained and ERB does an extraordinary job of providing just enough details to keep the story flowing and whetting the readers' appetites for more.The only complaint a modern reader might have about the book is that the girl, Dejah Thoris, is a bit ornamental. And yet 90 years ago she was a breath-taking step into the future for literary audiences. ERB's light sensuality lent an air of sophistication to his writing which escapes most authors today, many of whom confuse sex scenes with entertainment and plotting. But the real beauty of the classic ERBian woman is that she has feelings and no matter how hard she tries to mask them she inevitably gives in to love provided the right suitor comes along. Many a modern Romance novelist must have secretly studied under this master's steady hand."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This whole John-Carter-on-Mars series is, in my opinion, even better than his Tarzan series! Burroughs lets his imagination go wild, creating an entire planet of noble Martian warriors, lots of evil Martians, and plenty of beautiful Martian women for the men to fight over! This first book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Books 2 &amp; 3 are a bit over-long, but it really picks up after that! The people and races of Martians created by Burroughs is really fantastic --- this is sci-fi which is still excellent reading today!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Kindle edition of ERB's Martian series!Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.As many reviewers of this and other ERB stories point out, do not expect \\"politically correct\\" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.\\"Princess of Mars\\" is an astounding piece of fantasy. First story of ERB to be published it contains the seeds of lots of sci-fi and Fantasy novels to come in the following years. Also we may detect some traits of Tarzan in John Carter character.It's a pleasure to read so \\"fresh\\" adventures depicting a whole planet culture, ecology, interaction between different races, monsters, and inventions far ahead of ERB real world, as \\"rifles with explosive bullets guided by wireless sensors\\".It amazes me how ERB can master in a rather short text (for our standards); a high paced action story. Even if this book is more than 90 years old, you will enjoy it from the first to the last page and possibly continue reading all Carter's series.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is a nice Dover reprint of the first of Edgar Rice Burrough's Mars novel, which first appeared serialized in wide-circulation pulp magazines in the early years of the twentieth century.Never quite as popular as Burrough's Tarzan books, the Mars series ranks right up there with the Pellucider (center of the earth) as fantasies dear to the hearts of boys of all ages. (Personally, I've always liked the Mars series better than Tarzan or Pellucider, but--as my wife notes--Burroughs does have a thing about apes, which appear on Mars as well as in the African jungle.)The story is completely implausible, even for its time. Burrough's gee-whiz fascination with pseudo-science such as radon as a universal energy source, and mystical \\"rays\\" unknown on earth, ring particulalarly hollow.Plopped down among the green hordes of war-like Mars, Virginia gentleman John Carter ex of the Confederate army unites the green Thark hordes to aid the Heliumite civilization of red Martians and win the hand of the incomparable Dejah Thoris in the first of the eleven Mars books.The book is written in language that probably was intentionally pompous and archaic even for its own time, making it a great vocubulary expander for today's kids who some day will face the SATs. It's amazing that in the hundred years since it was first published, and the millions of copies sold, no one has gone through this book to fix the words spelled incorrectly and other typos.The book conforms to todays PG rated movie standards: tons and tons of violence, and no sex. Well, Martians are hatched from eggs, anyhow.I first read this book, and the other books in the Mars series, as a kid, far longer ago than I care to admit. Now, I'm reading them to my eight-year-old son, who loves them.Flaws, weirdnesses, and bizarre language to the despite, I highly recommend the Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars books to anyone who has a taste for tales of fantastic adventures!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Watching John Carter got me to reread A Princess of Mars. I barely remembered anything of the book, and it's only 81 pages, plus the Kindle version was free!It's definitely superior to the film, and good campy pulp fun. Plus, when you take into account it's 1917 publication date, it's actually pretty impressive!The writing itself is fast and clean, even if the sentences include copious subordinate clauses, high falutin vocabulary, and the occasional archaic turn of phrase. Like \\"fetich\\" which my Kindle dictionary informed me is a dated spelling of \\"fetish.\\" The style suffers a little -- by modern standards -- from an overabundance of \\"tell.\\" The book moves rapidly and the narrator tells you in a straightforward first-person past what happened. He doesn't illustrate the points by action, but calls it as he sees it. Even the action is given to narrative summary rather than blow by blow description. This is compact and functional but feels dated.The plot is a straightforward adventure. Our protagonist, who is pretty much great at everything, hurls himself from one predicament to the next, all the while extracting maximum drama and showmanship. Things rarely go badly for him, and there is little subtly of choice. I can see how significant an effect Burroughs had on mid century pulp Science Fiction masters like Phillip Jose Farmer or L. Ron Hubbard (I'm ignoring the religion and talking about the writer). Farmer adventures like Dark is the Sun, World of Tiers, or The Cache feel like direct descendants of A Princess of Mars.For 1917, the world building is fairly extensive. There aren't too many outer space adventure novels before this, so he must have invented a lot of the tropes. There are flying craft, exploding bullets, terraforming machines, and all sorts of goodies. And all in an era when the biplane was the height of aeronautical tech.The book's biggest weakness is the utter lack of subtlety. John Carter is able to instantly read into alien situations and ferret out the meaning -- even when he can't understand the language. He is an instant master of the new tech, a perfect navigator, etc. The solution to his problems are usually readily available. Burroughs resorts to certain devices -- like convenient eavesdropping -- multiple times. The \\"romance\\" between Carter and Dejah Thoris is formulaic at best. Still, she is described repeatedly as gorgeous and nearly naked, which sets the standard for pulp heroines.As a student of media conversions, I continue to wonder at the bungles in the recent film adaptation. Read my thoughts on the John Carter film here, but while they borrowed most of the characters, situations, and feel from the novel, they made many plot changes for the worse. Some of the camp factor does come from the source material, and there would probably be a need to simplify the action, however this doesn't excuse the addition of multiple prologues, and ridiculous meta-villains. Pulp action is pulp action. Dressing it up with an extra layer of plot complexity doesn't change that.Andy Gavin - author of The Darkening Dream"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This is claimed to be an enhanced version of the book by Vook I am not sure what the enhancement is but it would be better to have included the last pages of chapter 15 as they are important to the story and without these the beginning of chapter 16 will make little sense (This book was free at the time of downloading but still no excuse). Although this version does have original illustrations I would avoid this version and download the \\"Project Gutenberg\\" version which although missing the illustrations is at least complete.Moan over back to the story:-This is the first of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series all featuring the adventures of John Carter. When you consider this was his first book originally published in 1917 it is truly remarkable in how he portrays so vividly the Martians, although the style of writing seems dated the story holds its own against modern stories. I am not sure if I would call this more fantasy than science fiction as where the author has no way of explaining something with the understanding of the 1900s he does not worry about it, it just happens. For example early in the story John Carter is overcome by \\"fumes\\" in a cave on Earth and wakes up on Mars (problem solved). This is I believe one of the first stories where a determined attempt to describe aliens has been made and it is very successful.A five star story hidden under a one star implementation."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs was a master of this style of story. His imagination and absolute commitment to his characters keeps this story from being stale, despite a slightly old-fashioned narrative style. Burroughs wrote in a different era. Before books became so long and, pardon the insult, frightfully dull. These stories were written for public consumption. Unfortunately, now reading has become a niche market with very little interest in attracting a general audience. Enough social commentary. On to the novel.Burroughs creates a violent, merciless world populated by violent, merciless people. Yet, like his most popular character Tarzan, he somehow manages to give them depth and sympathy. The Tharks (giant, green Martians) are truly alien creatures who somehow become ultimately very human as John Carter's adventure progresses. And Carter's boon companion, a horrible beast named \\"Woola\\", is one of my favorite characters.The story is lightning fast. There's character development or a action in every chapter (very often both). John Carter himself, while likable, is not that interesting. But the real star of this story is the alien world that Burroughs makes into such a fantastic (and yet very real) place.Hail to the King!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book is terrific. Princess of Mars, being Carl Sagan's favorite book as a child, has a very nice mix of sword fighting, military weapons, and sci-fi.Burroughs did pretty well for his first book(and for his time),with great imagination. for I have never heard of a story back then in 1910s that is about Mars with a same kind of weapons we have here on Earth.The story is about a war veteran from Virginia named John Carter, who was strangely teleported to Mars. There he found strange aliens, and others that looked like humans. There he met a lovely Princess, and togethor they must escape Green 12-foot Martians, White Apes, and other dangerous creatures.This is book is one of the best books I've read.

Thank goodness I still have a lot of little boy in me..this is the stuff young boys, and girls, dream of. It is interesting how many current fantasy novels/stories are clearly influenced by this work, wheather the authors know it or not.

If you want deep and profound, go elsewhere...if you want just fun...go with these."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"The word 'classic' isn't one that should be thrown around lightly, but I think that it's safe to say that _A Princess of Mars_ meets all the criteria of a classic. This book was the start of a series which defined what science fiction has since become and is very readable and enjoyable apart from its historic significance.Some of the best naming of all time goes on here-- Dejah Thoris and Tars Tarkas and Barsoom-- the adventures of an adventurer, pulled into another world and made a part of its life. Featuring gravity differences and BIG green men and nearly-naked girls, there's something for nearly anyone."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"This book is a classic but suffers from any of the problems of antiquated sci fi.

There, he witnesses the depravity of a \\"highly developed\\" race of people who, because medicine helps them to live long lives, they perform population control by warring with each other. In some ways, though, they're happier than people on Earth, because they have no lawyers. John Carter takes Mars (and a Princess's heart) by storm. I'm not a huge fan of pulp fiction, so I expected very little out of this book. Because of that, I was impressed at how \\"not bad\\" it was. Actually, it was sort of interesting in a history-of-science-fiction sort of way. It did have some rather racist comments about Native Americans (an artifact of when it was written), and the Princess was a weak annoying little thing whose only virtues were rare beauty and a penchant for getting into trouble so that we could witness the excitement of her rescue (this is an artifact of being pulp). Overall, not too shabby. But not literature, either. I DID wonder whether John Carter was meant to be some sort of pulpy Christ figure. He was very good at saving people.

Burroughs wrote several novels in the planetary romance style, which this book is one of, where the hero meets a woman, falls in love, subsequently become separated and the hero must fight his back to the woman he loves.The tales are called \\"planetary\\" because the adventures take place on another planet, like Mars, or some realm, such as the center of the earth, and not in the ordinary world we know. Burroughs was quite successful with this type of novel and A Princess of Mars, follows the formula. Although the genre was labelled romance, it is romance in the Victorian sense. The novels are adventure, pure and simple.A Princess of Mars takes place on a Mars imagined by scientists in the 1800's. It is a Mars of lower gravity, breathable atmosphere, canals and aliens. In this Mars there are warring factions, grand deadly games and plenty of sword fighting.

His main character is the famous John Carter and the book features action and adventure tossed in with some Sci-Fi and alien life forms. EG Burroughs was one of the early masters of Sci-Fi and this book is as good of a read today as it was when it came out in 1912. It is not so much a Sci-Fi story as an action adventure where a hero that has good fighting skills and extraordinary strength has traveled to the planet Mars and becomes involved in that world's politics and wars.The book is entertaining and fun to read and the action filled. I won't ruin the story by telling you all about it but you will like the storyline. It is not serious reading and it is just for entertainment but once you read it you will want to continue with the reading of the series. There are many good books in the series that you will enjoy.

It's probably not the best of that series, but a must-read if you want to see how modern sci-fi began.The best thing about the Mars series (and Tarzan, and Venus, and Pellucidar) -- and what makes it so important in sci-fi -- is its efforts to rationalize all sorts of outlandish things through scientific and cultural explanation (I'm convinced!). \\"Princess\\" has a few \\"feeler\\"-type occurrences, with ERB putting sci-fi stuff out there in print for the first time, making sure to expand on the whys and hows for the virgin readership -- but after he sets up the whole genre of modern sci-fi, the series takes off in a run of books that stab at his Mars idea from all sorts of crazy angles.You can read the Mars series in order, but after reading the first two or three books to understand the world ERB created, I especially recommend jumping to \\"The Synthetic Men of Mars\\" (cool! headless man-like beasts being farmed by body-less head-only men, for self-evident reasons) And \\"The Chessmen of Mars\\" which kept me up all night when I was 16.Yes, all the women are beautiful and to die for, although they have pretty much no personality, and all the heroes are bombastically and genetically heroic in a medieval way with, likewise, no personality (and anything related to sex with ERB is bizarre, unconsummated and usually requires drawing of swords and the author's ambivalent but feverish avoidance of innuendo, despite everyone always being naked, it seems -- kinda freaky), but minor characters steal the story from the cardboard protagonists -- and hell, it was 1912, after all, and ERB had never written a book before....."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When I was 9yrs old my father read the first chapter of this book to me - I subsequently read the whole burroughs collection before I was ten.Edgar is a master!If you like adventure and fantasy this book and the rest of the martian tomes are a must.Happy reading."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"The similarities between all past and currentmovie-book-media science fiction/planetary travel-explorer-warrior-savior genre (especially films such as Star Wars, etc.) owe it all to The John Carter on Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

Thankfully though my fears were allayed as I found myself sucked into the incredible world of Barsoom. The concepts within this story are utterly fantastical, even more so if you consider when it was written and as a reader I was enthralled. The love story--which it indeed is--is just beautiful. I can't wait to read the next in the series! I did have a chuckle at the frequent contradictions made by the author but the story telling is wonderful and it is fantasy, so you need to put finicky thoughts aside.

He soon discovers that he's somehow been transported to the planet Mars (or Barsoom), and is apprehended by the barbaric green Martians of Thark, who do not understand love or friendship. But thanks to gravity and his own skills, John Carter is able to gain the respect of the Tharks, and even becomes a chieftain.But the Tharks capture Dejah Thoris, a princess of the more humanlike red Martians. John Carter soon falls in love with her. As their safety is threatened by a small conspiracy of extra-cruel Tharks, Carter starts plotting to escape to the Red Martian city of Helium.

Full of swordplay and daring feats, the novel is considered a classic example of 20th century pulp fiction. It is the story of how John Carter, (no relations to Jimmy) woke up in Barsoon (Mars) after a fight with Indians in Arizona. It is also a seminal instance of the planetary romance, a sub-genre of science fantasy that became highly popular in the decades following its publication. Its early chapters also contain elements of the Western. The story is set on Mars, imagined as a dying planet with a harsh desert environment. This vision of Mars was based on the work of the astronomer Percival Lowell, whose ideas were widely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.The Barsoom series inspired a number of well-known 20th century science fiction writers, including Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, and John Norman, and was also inspirational for many scientists in the fields of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life, including Carl Sagan, who read A Princess of Mars when he was a child.Coinciding with the movie release of a film adaptation, John Carter, the Library of America will publish a hardcover edition based on the original book in April 2012 with an introduction by Junot D&iacute;az (ISBN 978-1-59853-165-7).Earth, left to wonder what has become of Barsoom and his beloved.Characters* John Carter: An Earthman from Virginia with a mysterious background, Captain John Carter fought in the American Civil War on the Confederate side. At the war's end he goes prospecting for gold in Arizona. After various adventures, including an attack by Apaches, he is miraculously transported to Mars. During his nine years on that planet he effectively disappears from Earth and is believed dead, but he re-emerges in New York in 1876, settling in a house overlooking the Hudson River. He apparently dies again in 1886, leaving instructions for a fictionalized Burroughs, who refers to Carter as his Uncle Jack, to entomb him in a crypt (with a lock accessible only from the inside and good ventilation. He also leaves Burroughs with the manuscript of A Princess of Mars, with instructions not to publish it for another 21 years. ] John Carter states that he has no memory before the age of 30 and has always appeared the same, without aging. He is adept at strategy, horsemanship, and all weapons, including firearms and swords. He is 6'2\\" tall, clean-shaven, with close-cropped black hair and steel gray eyes.1] He is honorable, courageous, and eternally optimistic, even in the face of certain death. From the Green Martians he received the name \\"Dotar Sojat,\\" after the first two green warriors whom he slew after his advent on Barsoom. He sometimes uses this name as an alias in later books of the Martian series.* Dejah Thoris: A red Martian princess of Helium, she is courageous, resolute, and frequently in mortal danger or under threat of dishonor by the lustful designs of a succession of villains. She is the daughter of Mors Kajak, Jed (chieftain) of Lesser Helium, and the granddaughter of Tardos Mors, Jeddak (overlord or high king) of Helium. As such she is highly aristocratic and fiercely proud of her heritage.]Introduced early in the novel, she immediately becomes the love interest of John Carter. As a central character in the first three Barsoom novels, her frequent capture by various enemies, and subsequent pursuit by John Carter, is a constant motivating element in their plots.* Tars Tarkas: A fierce Green Martian warrior from the tribe of Thark, he is unusual among his race for his ability to experience tender emotions such as friendship and love. His emotional development stems from a forbidden love affair in his youth, when he secretly began a partnership with a Green Martian woman named Gozava. He befriends John Carter and later fights at his side. Carter helps him become Jeddak of Thark and negotiates an alliance between the Green Martians and the city-state of Helium, which results in the destruction of Helium's enemy, Zodanga. Tars Tarkas more than once displays an ironic sense of humor; he mocks John Carter's perception of himself as \\"a cruel green warrior\\" while fighting beside him, and in The Gods of Mars he comments on the disappointment of Barsoomian hopes for the afterlife.* Sola: Daughter of Tars Tarkas and a friend of John Carter, she teaches him the Barsoomian language and the history of her race, as well as the secret of her own parentage. She appears in the immediate sequels to A Princess of Mars, but has no role in later books of the series.* Sarkoja: A Green Martian woman whose intrigues resulted in the death of Gozava and who schemes against John Carter. After Carter tells Tars Tarkas about her role in Gozava's death, she is frightened into a self-imposed exile and never heard from againThe next book in this series isThe Gods of Mars (Townsend Library Edition)- Martian Tales #2I highly recommend this bookGunner March, 2012"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"When Edgar Rice Burroughs began writing his Barsoom series, people didn't know a lot about Mars except that it seemed to have canals.So Burroughs came up with his own elaborate fantasy world, populated by green barbarians, airships, multi-legged beasts and giant hairy white apes.

Before doing that, however, I decided to go back to the source and re-read the book that began the series of books on which the film is based as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs' very long and prolific career and re-read A Princess of Mars, a book I first encountered over 40 years ago.While fully aware of ERB's limitations as a writer of fiction as well as a stylist, I can time travel back to my fourteen-year old self to the extent that I can understand the appeal to myself as well as millions of others, mostly boys of that same approximate age. What Burroughs lacked in characterization, subtlety, nuance, profundity or any other attribute one might attach to great writing he compensated for with sheer zeal and enthusiasm and the freewheeling, uninhibited imagination of a daydreaming child. Before I became cultured and educated in literary taste acquired as an English major, his prose even struck me as eloquent and poetic in its pulpish way.A Princess of Mars was originally published in a pulp magazine 100 years ago. Literary and popular tastes and fashions were completely different and the speculation of life on another planet was left largely unhindered by adherence to scientific fact because, frankly, scientific fact regarding other planets was quite limited. Therefore, wild tales about another planet based on scant information could become read and devoured by readers seeking escapist \`scientific romance' with relatively easy suspension of disbelief.One tactic ERB uses in setting the stage for his John Carter stories (as well as his Tarzan series and most of his other creations) is to present his outrageous tale in an almost plausible framework. John Carter is a former Confederate captain prospecting in Arizona, pursued by hostile Indians to a remote cave where he discovers a strange talisman. The method for transporting himself, leaving his seemingly dead body, to Mars or Barsoom, as it is called by its inhabitants, is purposely vague. ERB didn't expend too much energy attempting scientific plausibility like his descendants Clarke and Asimov would do. He couldn't wait to get to his destination and let the adventure commence.This romance, like the rest of the Mars series and like all of his fantasies set in imaginative worlds, is a series of fights, captures, escapes, rescues, tests of strength and pledges of honor and undying love all unfolding against a backdrop of a world of four-armed green Martians with large tusks riding eight-legged \`thoats,' of an atmosphere factory that generates the oxygen that sustains the planet, a world where John Carter can read the minds of its occupants whereas they cannot penetrate his mind, where the gravitational difference from Earth provides him with the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound, literally, decades before another otherworldly hero emerged in popular culture.World building, full of strange inhabitants with even stranger names, was one of ERB's greatest talents. The planet Barsoom, with characters such as Tars Tarkus the jeddak of Thark, Dejah Thoris the princess of Helium, thoats that carry warriors like horses, a faithful dog-like creature called Woola and characters with names such as Sola, Tal Hajus, Kantos Kan and Lorquas Ptomel set the stage for imaginative worlds like Arrakis with characters named Muad'Dib and later worlds with Jedi orders, planets named Naboo and Tatooine and characters with equally strange names such as Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi.His adventures are ridiculous and his plots absurd but when one returns to the state of mind of the adolescent boy and regains the simple desire for adventure against the backdrop of these fantastic, exotic worlds one may be able to succumb to the charms of Edgar Rice Burroughs."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"From the Trailers for the Movie that is out.

I will say, though, that this book begins the career of Edgar Rice Burroughs and that it's success leads the author to create Tarzan, Pellucidar, and many other stories. And more Barsoom! John Carter, Confederate veteran, fights, runs, leaps, loves, befriends and brings the races of dying Mars together when he isn't busy waging war or rescuing maidens. Actually, he brings the races of dying Mars together WHILE waging war and rescuing maidens. One can clearly see how Tars Tarkas begat Chewbacca, and how John Carter himself begat Flash Gordan, Luke Skywalker, and Superman... yes, Superman.And the second book, _The Gods of Mars_, is even better!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.\\"Princess of Mars\\" is an astounding piece of fantasy. First story of ERB to be published it contains the seeds of lots of sci-fi and Fantasy novels to come in the following years. Also we may detect some traits of Tarzan in John Carter character. It's a pleasure to read so \\"fresh\\" adventures depicting a whole planet culture, interaction between different races, monsters, ecology, and inventions far ahead of ERB real world, as \\"rifles with explosive bullets guided by wireless sensors\\".It amazes me how ERB can master in a not so extensive text (for our standards); a high paced action story.Even if this book is 90 years old, you will enjoy it from the first to the last page.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"First of all, let me say I am biased. I read these books 15 years ago in grade school and there is an element of nostalgia for me. With that said, I really enjoy these books. I have frequently come back and re-read the first several in the series because no matter what age, they always let my mind wander. Don't expect \\"hard\\" sci-fi like Peter Hamilton, Stephen Baxter, or Kim Stanley Robinson. This was written in the early 1900s and it shows in some parts of the story. It is obvious to us now that Mars was never occupied and the Sun's light does not have 9 rays.This shouldn't take away from a wonderful series. Burroughs does an excellent job of narrating a story full of details that bring to life the world of Barsoom, which is full of danger, love, and a lot of Deus ex Machina. The action in the story is always exciting and you are always rooting for the Earth-born superman as he uses his skills, cunning, and luck to best opponents while trying to maintain his Virginian honor.If you decide to start reading this series I only ask that you suspend your disbelief and enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"\\"I have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it can not grasp......\\"Written in 1912 this book is well written for its time and has intrigued countless generations of readers. I get the feeling that this story is being told over a campfire.Captain Carter is telling the story form memory as an old man of his adventures here on earth and on the planet of Barsoom (Mars). There are encounters with many strain creatures, situations, and yes even a \\"Princess of Mars.\\"This is a part is a series by the writer that brought us \\"Tarzan.\\" The intro to the book alone will capture your imagination.The Great Book of Tarzan"},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I can't even begin to count the number of times I have read Burrough's Mars series, and this is the greatest of them all. It has everything: swordfights, a love story, high adventure, ancient, advanced civilizations, and a naked princess who has no qualms about revealing her love for a man she hardly knows but loves with all her heart. No one other than Burroughs could have written a novel like this, and I'm glad no one else did. If you want to have a great read, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I have read this novel numerous times, and is one of the most influential science fictions novels around. The imagination of Burroughs is enthralling. These are much more superior than even his Tarzan books. I have read the whole series (9 books), and honestly the best are the first three novels. After that, it gets a bit redundant. Princess of Mars should be a facet in anyone's collection of fine literature."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"I finally read A Princess of Mars last month, after years of reading Burroughs' Tarzan books, sometimes several times over. Although this book shows shows the potential greatness that Burroughs was to achieve with the better Tarzan books, it's not really in the same league. The Tarzan novels at their best are complex, involving,and profound (at their worst, they're silly and repetitious, but, you know...)A Princess of Mars is certainly imaginative, but it's not really thought-provoking. It's clear that Burroughs was strongly inspired by Jules Verne's novels, and it's clear that he's having a great time inventing the green Martians, their hover bikes, the giant atmosphere generator, the beautiful (and not really clothed) Princess Dejah Thoris, and the countless other denizens of the war-torn planet Mars. But the story is linear, there are no subplots, and some of the Martian inventions just seem silly (the egg incubators unguarded in the middle of the desert?)Still, it's hard not to enjoy the story at a comic-book level. There may not be much subtlety to this book, but Burroughs was a born storyteller, and his straight-ahead, urgent narrative style is hard to resist. And although Burroughs' characters are justifiably criticized as being one-dimensional, it's exactly this simplicity that somehow makes them so appealing, and draws the reader into concern for their fates.As some of the other reviewers here have said, younger readers would probably enjoy this book more. But I enjoyed it enough to want to read some of the other John Carter books. For a very good Burroughs book, read the original \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\" For sheer escapism, though, A Princess of Mars will do fine."},{"Title":"A Princess of Mars","review":"John Carter!The Warlord of Mars!Dejah Thoris, the most beautiful woman ever!Action! Excitement!It was all that in my youth. But somehow now, as an adult, things have changed.The writing is muddied, and the perspective not near as good as I remembered from those past times.For a young person, A Princess of Mars is a classic. The times that Burroughs wrote, this first person narrative style was probably all the rage. I remember that I felt a compulsion to read the stories when in my teens.Now though I see that there are points in the writing and development of the story that do not work as well for me as an adult that did when I was a child. Enjoyable yes. But not the great adventure story that it had been. And then suspend my disbelief as Burroughs tried to build his world. That has some problems that just don't seem to connect and I can't gloss over as I could when I was younger.Not only that, but the action just does not seem as well choreographed as it used to seem, and from the fire to the frying pan is just one looping occurrence. John Carter never seems to have a moment to take a breath which a penny-dreadful type tale might require. A well developed novel feels like it should allow for more.At this stage, having read the series when a child, I might finish the entire reread, but I think watching Disney's interpretation even with actors who are not as heroic, or as beautiful, as Burroughs portrayed them will serve."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"I really enjoyed reading about World War II and Hitler. I read The Gadget in an advanced reading class, this book is mostly geared toward boys in general.I was surprised when someone turned out to be a spy. If you are going to buy this book I actually wouldn't pay [very much money for it]. I would rather get the book from the library than pay for it. The book doesn't last long enough for me.

For me it really lacks adventure. Sure it is about the making of the Atomic Bomb, but half the time it gets off that subject. Half the time the author is telling us about his friend and having barbeques. Of course with all books there is a time where you do want to read on, but it only happens once or twice. It happened once in the middle of the book and once at the end. To sum it up, it really blows during half the story. But one cool thing is that someone dies at the beginning of the story and at the end.This story first takes place in London, England, where Stephen [the main character] and his cousin Jackson go up to the roof of their apartment to listen to army radio channels. But this time a bombing takes place and the roof door wouldn't budge. So they hide. That's when a bomb hits right near the building; a chunk of the building falls and Jackson goes with it and dies. So Stephen moves to America where his \\"adventure\\" begins. I have to tell you though, there is a good twist is at the end, but anyway. So he moves to America to live with his father who is working on a \\"project of high importance.\\" Then Stephen meets a Russian kid named Alexei and they become close friends. Did I mention there is a cool twist at the end? Well now you know about the story a bit.Truly though any reader could like this book, its just that I thought it was average. The only type of reader that wouldn't like this book would be one of those enchanted fairy tail creature types or the type who is obsessed with the \\"Warriors\\" book. Because, sorry to say, there are no talking cats named Blubber foot or whatever, that act like a bunch of cats and think they can kill anyone. That is basically my review."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"This book is about a boy sent to an army with his dad, but his dad is already there.

Loren Eiseley's essay (upon which this starfish story is based) was not published until the late 1970s. I suppose that fictional young Stephen _could_ have made a similar observation and come to similar philosophical conclusions in the 1940s--similar to those of Eiseley's in the 1970s--but it seems a stretch.

The way that it explains how a young man is feeling while living in that time period and having his father working on a \\"project\\" (atomic bomb)and his views on what was going on. It kept my mind thinking what will happen next and why is that happening.Stephen and his mother lived in Londen while his father lived on a top secert military base during World War 2.

This is wear we meet Steven, a 13 year old boy who is the son of a physicist. Steven lives with his father in a town that does not exist, Los Alamos, NM. This is wear the USA plans to stop the war, it is also wear Steven and his new found friend Alexia find out how.I thought this was a good book, especially for those who are reluctant to sit down and take the time to read. Like most of Zindel's books, the chapters in The Gadget are short, but catchy. I found that this seemed to make the book more suspenseful, and flow much better. The shorterr chapters make more sense in this book to, since each chapter is equal to a day or two in Steven's life at Los Alamos. I also discovered that the author does not spice his writing with uneeded ingritents. The writing is simple,crisp, and two the point.As you read this story, you notice how two of the main chracters change. Steven seems to drift away from his father, as Steven's father wants to become closer to his already distant son, but can't due to his work. I found this predictable because his father was never home.I found that this book was inticing, and did not contain any major flaws. The only flaw that seemed to bother me wasthat in moved extemely fast, but this may suit different readers. I also found how historicly accurate this book was even though it was historical fiction.While i was reading this book it reminded me of the movie Pearl Harbor, because of it's connection to WWII. It also reminded me of the movie starring Nicholas cage, but iI cant remember it's title. This movie is almost exactly like the book except for the abcense of Steven.Overall I thought that this was a good book for young readers who are afraid to read."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"My 4th grader chose this book for a \\"realistic fiction\\" book report. I read it as well. I was a little surprised by what I thought was a mismatch between the level at which the book is written and the content. I think my 4th grader (10 year old boy) is still too young to really appreciate the content, but that his reading level is beyond the book. I guess I am just not sure who the book is for -- it seems too easy and simply-written for the age of child who would appreciate it best. But maybe as a quick read for, say, a 7th grader, it is just right.I think if this book report wasn't due tomorrow, we should have picked a different book. Nevertheless, I thought The Gadget was a good introduction to a discussion with my son about The Bomb and about World War II history. As others have written, it is suspenseful and gives a somewhat balanced perspective on the pros and cons of having the weapon (within the limitations of the time at which the story takes place, the genre of the book, intended audience, etc.). There are also some short bios at the end of the key figures involved in the conception and design of the bomb, as well as a WWII time line. (I was disappointed by some sloppy production issues in the paperback: my son noticed at one point that Stephen was spelled 'Steven' with a 'v'. On the back cover it mentions a friend named \\"Tilanov\\" when the friend's name is Alexei Nagavatsky. Where did that come from?)"},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"The title of the book I read, was The Gadget. The author was Paul Zindel. In this book, I honestly didn't think there were any weaknesses. Its strengths were that it goes along with WWII history. It also was a very mysterious book.A short summary is as follows. Stephen (the main character) goes to a secret place where his father works at a laboratory. At the laboratory, scientists are making something they could, as they thought, WWII. Only a few people know about the project and Stephen wants to figure out what the secret is.This book falls under the category of mystery. It can also be categorized under historical fiction. I highly recommend this book to people who like history. This is because it is a great cliffhanger, and it leads you to what happens in history. There would be no reason that I would not recommend this book because it is a great book for all ages and lots of people like mysteries.What I liked about the author can be summed up this way. He puts great detail in this work. He also did a wonderful job portraying history in The Gadget. It felt like I was there most of the time.

If you have any doubts about that, peruse the &quot;new books&quot; shelf in the juvenile section of your local library.That's why it was refreshing to see that Zindel provided a reasonably balanced presentation of the pros and cons of the use of the A-bomb to end the war. The protagonist, young Stephen, was used by Zindel to give the &quot;con&quot; view (not completely realistically; it's unlikely that a child would immediately grasp all the implications and give all the usual suggestions about alternatives to using the bomb -- making a &quot;demonstration drop&quot; in the ocean, for example). But the character of Stephen's father was used to expound the reasons the bomb, horrible as it was, needed to be used.My own view is that the use of the bomb was necessary and justifiable. But whether the young readers of this book agree with me or not, I am pleased that they are being given something to think about -- rather than being fed blatant propaganda."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"I found this book a very interesting book. I liked how the author started off the story in London, showing the attack and all the information to get you caught up. Then when he moves the story to the military base in New Mexico, I found it easy to tell what was going on in the base, it was very descriptive. The author also made you wait a while until you found out what kind of project Stephens father was working on. Also when you meet Alexei you don't think anything is going on, just that he is an ordinary kid. So I like how he kind of hid things from you until he felt like he would let you know.Also when he tells the historical events that are happening outside of the story it gave me a better sense of what time it was. And when you find out what the \\"Gadget\\" is you understand why the man in the hospital gave Stephen the sunglasses. Also, the author gave all the attacks on Japan and how effective the gadget was, which showed how many people were killed by only 4 men. The author also used foreshadowing when the maid told Stephen she thought Alexei was a spy, and he ended up trying to kill Stephen because he found out he was a spy. You also learn about the relationship the Stephen didn't have with his father so he found other people in the base that he could love.He also she shows how the war was affecting everybody all over the world, even when the war was only going on between 3 countries. Over all I would recommend this book to people who like a good suspense or historical story.

A chase ensues between Stephen and Alexei and his father; in the end Stephen is safe, Alexei is hit by a train and killed, and his father and associates are taken away. Stephen learned more than he bargained for in his quest for answers.I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. I found it interesting because it related to topic we were studying in school. The book, The Gadget, is a great story about a boy in search for answers and the struggles and hardships he faced along the way. The book is very descriptive and allowed me to visualize the events and settings. I felt the tension, worry, and other emotions along with the main character.I would definitely recommend The Gadget, to anyone because it was suspenseful from the beginning to the end; I had a hard time putting it down. This book grabbed my attention and never let go. The story of Stephen and the chances and adventures he took to find the secret of the base fascinated me. The answers he found shocked me; the base secret was a hidden atomic bomb, and Alexei and his family being spies. If you are looking for adventure, suspense, and surprise in your reading, you should definitely consider reading The Gadget."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"\\"I'm sorry, Steven,\\" he said, taking out a knife.\\" Now I have your attention. This book is called The Gadget and is a novel written by Paul Zindel.Well, I'll fill you in a little; Steven is a 13-year-old boy who comes to Las Alamos to stay with his father. Now Steven's father is not just any father he is the lead scientist for \\"The Gadget\\". The time period in this book is 1944 -1945, and we all know that this is during World War II. Steven's best friend at the camp is Alexei Nagavatskys. But his maid Sewa thinks Alexei and his family are spies. But how could this be if Alexei saved Steven from the monks who tried to kill him while he was in town?Steven and Alexei are trying to find out what this \\"Gadget\\" thing is, because after something goes wrong in the lab and one of the scientists is sent to the hospital in critical condition. This scares Steven because he knows that this could have easily been his dad. This book is a compelling drama that keeps you guessing till the end. Also the ending is surprising to say the least."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"The Gadget is a great book. It takes place during the World War 2. Where the sons father is working on the atom bomb. After watching his friends death on the roof of his family's apartment due to bombing. He moves to Los Alamos, Nevada where his father lives. As soon as he gets there he is wondering what the scientists are working on at Los Alamos. He found a friend who was wanting to find out the same thing. They explore the place and snoop around trying to find out the reason of Los Alamos. If you want to find out if he discovers the reason of Los Alamos, what they are creating, and why. You should read this book."},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"In 5th grade, my son was required to complete a project based on historical fiction. He didn't like any of the hundred or so options presented by the teacher. When he and I started to search for a title, I was surprised to find that so many of the historical fiction works have female protagonists! I wanted to find something that he would enjoy. The Gadget has a great deal of suspense and a sense of adventure. My son also really likes science and so it was helpful that Stephen's father was a physicist. My son really enjoyed it. The book also included a list of key dates and events from WWII in the appendix. The book did include accidents and death, so it may not be appropriate for a very sensitive child. I would definitely recommend this for a 10 to 11 year old boy required to read historical fiction!"},{"Title":"The Gadget","review":"In The Gadget, by Paul Zindel, a boy named Stephen wonders what his father is working on in the mysterious town of Los Alamos. His father tells him what he is working on could end the Second World War, but never tells Stephen what it is. Always asking questions, Stephen Later finds out the big secret and regrets ever wanting to know it. Ultimately, Stephen and his father grow closer when they get to the end of their adventure.This book is very easy reading but uses some powerful and moving language to get you attached to the book. Some of the events seamed a little unrealistic like the scene when Stephen and Alexei are being chased by the monks. The plot does have a lot of action in it which adds a little excitement to it. Suspense is also a big factor between Stephen and his unknown friend. I thought this book had some twists that are different from others. The book's meaning or moral to me is that not everything is your business to know and to stay away from certain things."},{"Title":"The winter of the world","review":"This is one of Anderson's better novels. Set on Earth several thousand years in the future during a glacial period, The Winter of the World uses a relatively conventional adventure story to present a clever idea about human evolution. The clever idea is the development of a new hominid species. Anderson suggests a mechanism of geographic isolation of a small population followed by intense selection to produce a new species. This is a straightforward extension of Mayr's allopatric model of speciation, now accepted as the predominant mode of speciation. Much of the book is devoted to describing the nature of these new hominids. The behavior of these alternative hominids is that of a romanticized and modernized noble savage. The plot is clunky; Anderson had some difficulties in melding his adventure story with the revelation that principal characters are a different kind of hominid. The quality of writing, like much of Anderson's work, is competent rather than good. There is a substantial element of wish fulfillment in this book. Anderson was a politically conservative individual with a pronounced libertarian bent. At the same time, he had strong reservations about the nature of capitalism. Many of his books present a longing for an 'organic society' based on strong individualism but with society based on strong personal ties and respect for the natural world. In this book, he achieves his wish by altering human biology."},{"Title":"The winter of the world","review":"It's the future, some future far beyond memory, where today's cities have vanished. War? Climate? Regardless, the outcome was catastrophic. The \\"oil age\\" is gone. What has evolved from the ashes of humanity's fires is a new society, and more than one.Poul Anderson, in The Winter Of The World, develops this new age, and focuses on the continuing need for empires to expand. It would certainly be a different book if written today, but Anderson continues to bring his inner eye to envision alternative futures."},{"Title":"The winter of the world","review":"The Winter of the World portrays a far-future earth in which the Northerners have evolved just enough to have their differences show what is lacking in the future medieval-human civilization. Donya of Hervar meets a human bent on espionage, in an action-packed, wonderfully war tale and love story. The differences in the two ures bring ecstacy but ultimately sadness to the human half of the love affair. Women are depicted as strong, independent, and thoughtful, somewhat unusual in a medieval tale. Highly recommended for all but the most ardent warrior-types."},{"Title":"The winter of the world","review":"This novel is short. It skims over many action sequences and jumps ahead several months at a time between chapters.

I do think the reader has a valid point and i discussed them with the mother of the child to whom I planned to give the book. After this discussion, we decided that it was okay for me to send the book. Some of the drawings of African-Americans are caricatures and offensive to me. My decision in which the child's mother concurred, was that given the parents' inclusive values they could help to place these drawings in their historical context. Also, this book is only one of numerous resources from which the child is learning about Abraham Lincoln.I still like the book very much. I have remembered a few of the illustrations since the book was read to me when I was six years old. I especially like the attention the book pays to Sarah Bush Lincoln, Lincoln's stepmother, who played an important role in his childhood."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"Would recommend this book highly.

The illustrations are charming and the stories inspire us to do more, be more."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"This book is wonderful. It tells about Abraham Lincoln from start to finish. Great for small children"},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"About 20% of this book is worthwhile reading. The other 80% remains historically inaccurate, mythological, or downright offensive. But I get ahead of myself.In 1940 Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire won the Caldecott medal for their picture book, \\"Abraham Lincoln\\". Like many idealized versions of Mr. Lincoln, this book relied on a couple old standbys. Lincoln was born in a log cabin. Lincoln wore a stovepipe hat. Then it adds a couple new myths to the brew. Lincoln apparently was friends with furry woodland creatures. He fought pirates and carried a scar from a fight with them over his left eyebrow. Finally, the book disintegrates into absolute fabrications. Lincoln, according to this text, was rivals with Stephen A. Douglas for the hand of Mary Todd. Not true. He went to war without provocation specifically to free the slaves. Not true. But how much can you blame a story that was written in 1939? It's possible that back then children's non-fiction books weren't held to the high standards they are today.Entirely aside from the inaccuracy of the text, the story is deeply offensive to African Americans and Native Americans. Here's a bit of what I mean. As justification for the destruction of the Sauk and Fox tribes (who merely wanted to raise corn on land that had been taken from the Native Americans thirty years earlier) the book says:\\"His tribe had sold the land to the 'paleface,' but Black Hawk said: 'Man-ee-do, the great spirit, gave us the land, it couldn't be sold'.\\"Needless to say, the tribes aren't actually named in this book. They're simply referred to as \\"Indians\\".And the African-Americans? Ecoute:\\"The next day President Lincoln walked into the town, holding little Tad by the hand. An old Negro recognized the long, thin man with the tall stove-pipe hat. \\"Here is our saviour,\\" he cried, and threw himself at Lincoln's feet. And suddenly Lincoln was surrounded by Negroes, weeping and rejoicing as they cried: 'Glory, glory hallelujah'.\\"Totally aside from whether or not that actually happened, it's the accompanying pictures that really drill this image home. The stereotypical African-American with the wide white eyes and big lips is everywhere in this book. From a slave auction, where a mammy-like woman stands on a podium to the vision of a group of happy former slaves praising their \\"saviour\\", there are repeated visions of stereotypical blacks not usually found in children's literature. In fact, many of the illustrations in this book suffer from a variety of ills. Some are offensive (don't even start me on the pictures of the Native Americans). Some are silly. There's a shot of Abraham and his sister standing in the woods, stylized tears stuck to their faces. The picture reminds you of nothing so much as one of those 1960s paintings on velvet of big-eyed children, once so popular. Some pictures are poorly constructed. The last shot of Lincoln suffers from such a lack of proper composition and perspective that you could spend hours trying to make it line up.And what 20% of this book is worth reading? Well, it's hard to get around the fact that there are shockingly few worthwhile books about Abraham Lincoln written with little kids in mind. If you want a fabulous book for older children then run, don't walk, to your nearest independent bookstore and buy \\"Lincoln: A Photobiography\\" by Russell Freedman. But for the little ones? As far as I can determine, this is the best you're going to be able to do. It does get kids interested in the life of Lincoln. And it makes him an understandable human being, with hopes and fears of his own. If you don't mind inaccuracies, the occasional poor illustration, and a tendency towards offensive images then this really is your best bet."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln","review":"I wanted to point out that the Abraham Lincoln book by Ingri & Edgar Parin d'Aulaire, though an award winner, was evaluated in 1972 by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, as \\"not recommended it's use under any condition.\\" p. 28 for racist content. They describe their reasons in a two page detailed analysis of the imagery and text. \\"This book does a disservice to Lincoln ad his involvement with Black and Indian people both groups are depicted in the illustrations as \\"white mans burden\\". page 27 second paragraph, and \\"Blacks are illustrated as rigid figures, their immovable faces a dense, dark impenetrable mass, pierced slightly by two white dots. This is a ghost-like portrayal which will frighten children instead of invoking compassion and understanding for Black people who lived in agony. Still another picture of an Indian shows the \\"savage\\" image ---he is jumping up and down in perpetual motion.\\" p. 28 second paragraph.Have we learned nothing in the last 30 years since it's review?

I'm glad the book did not discuss the assassination because this is obviously a children's book and that is a little much for a small child (to those who were disappointed that the book didn't give all the facts). All that matters to the child is the wonderful life this man led in honesty and standing for what he believed in.

Van Dine was one of the leading practitioners of the American detective story, and who inspired Ellery Queen and C. Daly King to write. This book, dealing with a series of murders taking place at secluded houses along Riverside Drive, New York, is similar to Van Dine's earlier &quot;Greene Murder Case,&quot; in that the murders are committed to a pattern - in the former book, Grost's handbook on criminology; in &quot;Bishop,&quot; according to Mother Goose (the original title was &quot;The Mother Goose Murders,&quot; though Van Dine changed them, as he did not want his readers to believe that he was writing for children). Besides being one of the first of the nursery-rhyme murders (c.f. both Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen), the book is also ingenious and bizarre, both in the commission of the murders and the unmasking of the murderer. Some of the scenes, though, owe small ideas to H. C. Bailey, as in the &quot;Little Miss Muffet&quot; murder (c.f. &quot;The Violet Farm,&quot; &quot;The Little House,&quot; &quot;The Bird in the Cellar,&quot; etc.). People have claimed to view Philo Vance as an infuriating snob, but he is no worse in this respect than Dorothy L. Sayer's Peter Wimsey, and a great deal better - Van Dine, for one, did not think of Philo Vance as the ultimate lover. In short, plenty of detection, plenty of atmosphere (despite Van Dine's rules, contained in &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;), and a fascinating glimpse of old-fashioned New World."},{"Title":"The Bishop murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"&quot;Cozy&quot; mysteries don't get much sillier than this, but it's probably the most entertaining of the Philo Vance novels in spite of the hokum. Ultimately, nearly all of the suspects are killed off, so figuring out whodunit isn't a major...uh, undertaking. But if you enjoy a good old-fashioned mystery, complete with bizarre (and not quite believable) goings-on, you'll probably like this one."},{"Title":"The Bishop murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"The Bishop Murder case is the fourth novel by S. S. Van Dine (pseudonym of Willard Huntington Wright)featuring his detective Philo Vance. Philo Vance was much in the mode of British fictional detectives of the period such as Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey who had made his appearance in 1926 inWhose Body?. The Philo Vance mysteries were wildly popular in the United States.Vance is a wealthy dilettante and aesthete who was portrayed as a dandy and bon vivant. The books were narrated by a fictional Van Dine who took the part of the Watson figure. His admiration for Vance was based on the fact that Vance excelled at any lofty, upper class thing he attempted. In short, Vance is a bit of an insufferable bore with a heavy smoking habit.However, there is an entertaining, campy quality about the stories and The Bishop Murder case is generally acknowledged as one of the better of the Vance stories. It is constructed around a number of Mother Goose rhymes where, for instance, a character named Christopher Robbin is found pierced by an arrow as in \\"Who Killed Cock Robin\\".Frankly, if you don't already have a soft spot for Vance or don't want to read one of the seminal works of the Mystery Genre then you might well find this book a bit heavy going. However, if you are prepared to suspend *a lot!* of disbelief and just going along for the campy ride then you might find yourself enjoying The Bishop Murder Case."},{"Title":"The Bishop murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"The Bishop Murder book focuses around a series of murders that are connected to nursery rhymes in the house of a mathematics professor.

I take it back. After having played the original Halo through to the end more than 10 times now, I now find these books irresistable.Halo Book One - The Fall of ReachThe first book of this trilogy details the formation of the Spartan II/Mjolinar program, including the origination of the characters Master Chief, Captain Keyes and Cortana. \\"Fall of Reach\\" fleshes out the backstory. How did the Covenent happen upon humanity in the first place? What were our first encounters with the Covenent like? What does \\"glassing a planet\\" entail? And what is it that the Covenent is after?The last question isn't answered completely, but this first volume does provide some tantalizing details that might give you a clue. You do, however, find out exactly what the Pillar of Autumn was up to prior to ending up in orbit around Halo.Eric Nylund does a great job of injecting some humanity into the Spartans (yes, there's more than one) and some drama and strategy into fight scenes with the Covenent. If you find yourself liking this book, you may want to pick up Nylund's \\"Signal to Noise\\" or \\"A Signal Shattered\\". No matter how good Nylund's military sci-fi is, his hard sci-fi is better.Halo Book Two - The FloodNormally, I'd say \\"skip this\\" if you've already played the game. And if you have played through the game, then the plot points in this novel won't lend you any surprises. It is, however, a testament to William Dietz's prowess as an author that even Halo veterans such as myself can pick up this book and still be interested in the subject matter. As with \\"Fall of Reach\\", \\"The Flood\\" fleshes out the Halo universe even further. Not only do you follow Master Chief as he combats the Covenent, the Flood and Guilty Spark 243 on the Jovian-orbiting ringworld of Halo, but you get up close and personal with some of the ODSTs (Helljumpers, who will play a large part in Halo 2), marines and non-coms who are aiding Master Chief in the fight. You even get to see the fight from the Covenant point of view.William Dietz was a fine choice for creating this novelization. Already an excellent military sci-fi author, he does great work here in turning a potentially lackluster novelization into something interesting and special.Halo Book Three - First StrikeI don't really want to ruin this one for Halo fans. The most important thing about this book is this - it acts as a bridge between the events of first Halo game and Halo 2. \\"First Strike\\", again by Eric Nylund, picks up right where first game ended - with Master Chief and Cortana stuck in a non-FTL bomber in the dead space surrounding the remains of Halo. I won't give away anymore except to say that Halo 2 is set-up perfectly here.The most impressive thing about the Halo books is this - the amount of backstory created for the Halo universe is stunning. If you've read anything about the new Halo 2 release and have read these novels, you'll understand what I mean. Plot points and military types from the first novel are being incorporated into or mentioned in Halo 2, ie - the aforementioned ODSTs. I have no idea WHERE this backstory came from - either from the imaginations of Dietz and Nylund or the impressive minds working at Bungie. It doesn't matter. Reading these books and playing these games, you become intimate with a well thought-out alternate universe. And its a great one to spend time in.November 9th can't come soon enough!Hopefully William Dietz is on the business end of that Halo 2 novelization, and this set will include four books in the future."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"i just got these 3 books yesterday...and i had time to sit down and read all three of them in a single day its a page turner for sure..highly addictive reading...these books flesh out all the backstory on the master chief and the spartins...yes he was one of a group of super soldiers :)..these books also tell us about the war with the covenant and how it came to start and what the covenant is actually looking for on the planet halo.... if your a sci fi reader or just like a good story loaded with action grab these books..oh and the box set is great for desktop display...cant wait to the halo movie that is going into production.. cheers"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"As a member of the US military, it is hard to find fictional military stories that combine sci-fi and a good solid storyline. These are the kind of books that I have been searching for. Worth the time to read and the money to buy."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Having experienced HALO: Combat Evolved and studying up a bit on the backstory I decided to risk a few bucks on these novels based on what previous reviewers have said. What did I think? Well, as a very picky and details oriented fan of military fiction and sci-fi I was pleasantly surprised and very entertained by these novels. The space combat scenes in The Fall of Reach and First Strike are simply fantastic. The action is believeable and creative. The technology imployed, whether Human, Covenant or other never seems too far-fetched. The Flood is a bit of a change of pace, as I had expected from reading other reviews, but it was no less entertaining or fun and intriguing. Also, the human stories are fascinating. While only a few characters are really developed in-depth they are dynamic in ways that the games could never get across. I personally found myself captivated by Jacob Keyes, Cortana, and especially everyone's favorite cyborg: John, Spartan 117.All in all this is a great series of novels and they add a wondrous wealth of knowledge and depth to the HALO universe. It's what I wish more military sci-fi stories could be. If you're not yet a fan of HALO, but you like military sci-fi then this is a great place to test the waters of the HALO universe. If you're already a fan and haven't read these books you're cheating yourself. These authors and the people at Bungie studios have created a tale full of adventure, mystery and a good share of hidden treasures.Revelation (John) 1:17And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, \\"Fear not; I am the first and the last; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.\\""},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"At first, I was hesitant to pick these titles up for the simple fact that, while I am a \\"gamer,\\" I'm not real big on sci-fi reading. I also feared that these books might add up to little more than fodder to lure more money out of the pockets of die-hard \\"Halo\\" fans by pandering to the already fanatical following the game has produced.And I was wrong.Halo's story successfully crosses the media lines in three amazing books that actually enriched my appreciation of the games.I used to like the fact that the Master Chief was that quintessential tough guy: mysterious and unbeatable, eternally resourceful and cool-headed, cold and battle-hardened. And, if you've played the games, then you know the gimmick: you never see his face.Well, these books unmask our beloved Spartan 117, literally and figuratively. Initially, I was a little jaded that these authors took it upon themselves to encroach upon the intergalactic man-of-mystery, but it wasn't long before I warmed up to learning his history and fighting his battles from a third-person perspective that's actually more \\"first-person\\" than even the game can offer. I learned to appreciate the depth of the human inside the helmet.I also enjoyed learning about the other Spartans and the tight fraternal bonds they forge with each other: bred and trained for battle, loyalty and duty, though essentially ostracized, feared and misunderstood by their \\"normal\\" human counterparts; there are several points when it's said that the other marines see the Spartans as being as alien as the alien race their fighting against.Most interesting, however, are the stories you get that the games never touch upon. There's many story-lines and characters introduced here that the games don't even mention, for obvious reasons- primarily because the games came out first. The first book takes place before (and sets up) the first game; the second book is pretty much the first game verbatim, from beginning to end, and the third is the detailing of events between the end of the first game and beginning of the second, Halo 2. In a lot of ways, it seems as if this console-to-page transition is similar to the efforts made a couple years back with the Matrix titles. In order to get the whole Matrix story, aside from the three films, one had to play a Matrix video game, watch a direct to DVD title and read Matrix books, all of which acted as vital arcs in the circle of events throughout the saga. Halo's last book, \\"First Strike\\" introduces a lot of loose ends that are left to dangle even throughout the second game. And we thought Halo 2's cliff-hanger ending couldn't get any worse! Now, I'm positively chompin' at the bit with anticipation of Halo 3.I'd say these titles work on a number of levels. Most importantly, I believe that the success of these games and books somehow asserts and validates gaming as a rapidly growing and infections new form of entertainment capable of holding its own next to blockbusting movies and New York Times best-selling novels; video games aren't just \\"for the kids\\" anymore. The story-telling and intrigue found in a game can be just as compelling, if not more so, than most of the rubbish Hollywood churns out anymore- not to mention that you get to participate and enjoy a sense of achievement as the stories unfold.I don't know if anymore books are in the making; perhaps they're waiting for Halo 3, but there's still a lot of story to tell, so I certainly hope I get the chance to read on."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"For anyone who is a fan of the Halo video games, this would be the best $[...] you'll spend outside of the games themselves. I've just finished the first book after 2 days of reading. I couldn't stop, and I'm one of those kids who HATES BOOKS! I cant stand them, but the fact that it was halo drove me to figure out the story line. It really puts you in the game and explains everything up to them finding the Halo ring. Besides, it's about $15, just have your parents buy them. Tell them your buying books and they'll be more than happy.

Good thing I did that after I started reading the first book in this series so my reading wasn't influenced by the opinions of others. I didn't read this book with a critical journalist's eye like some negative reviewers have done. I didn't care about grammer and typos and what not.I find the writer's description of the awesome space battles and the master chief's wild fights with the aliens truly nice. I got pure enjoyment out of reading this book, with my heart racing just following the hot adventures of John who later became the Master Chief.Though I've read many books, I've never sat down and read a science fiction novel until now. I use to believe that I wouldn't enjoy a book based on a video game. I stand corrected. This book is a page turner.. A warning to you commuters, who like to read while riding the train to work, be careful while reading this book for you might pass your stop. It has happened to me."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"This trilogy really is worth concidering if you are a fan of the story, and like explosions, gunfire and space bound tactics and battles.

My son is 14 and is really enjoying them."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I was totally captivated by these books. The writing is quite descriptive; it draws you in to the point you almost can feel red-hot plasma charges searing past you and then pound your fist with satisfaction as you blow a Covenant dropship out of the sky . . . the only negatives for me were the sometimes excruciatingly graphic descriptions of how creatures and humans met their deaths--more so in Book #2, The Flood, by William C. Dietz, than in Books #1 & #3, The Fall of Reach and First Strike, by Eric Nylund. Perhaps Mr. Dietz goes into these unsettling details because of his experience as a military medic. In spite of this caveat, the books are definitely worth your time; the characters make you care about them, and it's invaluable to know the history behind the Master Chief and his Spartans--that definitely enriches understanding. The books are awesome in their power to transport the reader into the vortex of unavoidable life or death situations in which defeat and catastrophic consequences for the entire human race seem to hang by a single thread. I really enjoyed these books and I'm kinda sorry there are no more of them in this series to read!!!"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"This book is very good. The story line is fantastic and I cannot put it down. There is one problem, however. This book was very poorly proofread if proofread at all. There are many grammatical mistakes and other errors that middle school students could eliminate if they had read their work. Nonetheless, I highly recommend The Fall of reach and the rest of the series as long as you are able to overlook certain imperfections."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"The Fall of Reach: This is perhaps my second favorite pick for the series as it tied in with the first game very well. It follows the Spartan program through it's infancy, showing how it came to be and what makes them special, and leaves off right where the game starts.The Flood: Basically just a rewrite of the first Xbox game, and is my least favorite of the books. Writen by a different author than the other two, William Dietz, his writing style is simular but his chapters are far and few between which make reading in short bouts difficult. What I did like about this book is how it described what else was taking place on Halo durring the events of the game, all taking place from different points of view, which made it feel more 'complete' as a book.First Strike: Takes place at the end of the first game, showing how the Master Chief got back to earth. My favorite of the series. Also ties in very well with the second game however left a few things un-answered and left it open for another book.The only thing that bothered me is how the games make it appear that the Master Chief is the only [surviving] Spartan, while the books tell a different story. Still -- they tie in very well with the game and flesh out the rest of the story. Recomended for anyone who enjoyed the single player campaign of the two games."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I bought this for my son.

I only read the first book, the fall of reach, but it was personally my favorite book I ever read by a LONGshot. I think even someone who has never even heard of the game might enjoy it, but it would definitely be more appreciable by one who is familiar to the game. im not going into details because i dont want to spoil anything, but for any halo lover, this bookis a must buy."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"This trilogy expands upon the Halo saga and I have to say that I was suprised at how good it was. Don't get me wrong - it probably won't win any awards, but it was all very thorough and meticulous in its detail and attention to the intricacies of the Halo games. All I have bad to say is that it opens as many questions as answers (quite a few of each). Of course this can hardly be argued as a weakness but I sure hope this isn't all we're going to see. I'm not going to ruin any surprises but there seems to be a signifigant event or events not covered at the end of First Strike (which is assumed to lead right into Halo 2). I can only hope that these points will be covered in either the next game or in this fabled Halo movie I keep hearing about. Anyway - definitely an enjoyable set of books!"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I bougth halo 1-3 book package, so far I read the fall of reach and I am reading the flood, but I already can tell the fall of reach it's and outstabding book from eric, he refer's so many details specially in the space battles, it makes you imagine the cruisers the fights the crossfire, its exciting, I never in mi life read a book so fast, every time I decided to stop mi head did't stop imagine what will happen next or how it would look like."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"the books told some stories happend in the HALO universerse.

The Fall of Reach will detail everything you wanted to know about the Master Chief's origins starting with a fascinating glimpse of his childhood and going above and beyond all expectations in this regard, as well as everything that lies between him and Cortana, and The Flood will answer all those niggling questions that you had after racing through the Maw on legendary for the umpteenth time. Finally, First Strike penetrates the mysteries that lie between Halo and Halo 2.How did Johnson get off Installation 04?How does it feel to become floodified?Wonderfully creative, the books nevertheless read much like a first-person-shooter, often detailing a sequence of events rather than truly weaving a story in and of itself. Your protagonist will advance to this platform, butcher this enemy, but it will be much like the last, and will often skip over the opportunities of the great imagery of a true sci fi epic that should lie between major 'checkpoints'. Detail is more scientific than artistic as if the author, quite understandably, has assumed you've been through the area already with a controller between your thumbs.Expect a committed, truly great tribute to the game we all know and love. Expect answers, and lots of them. Expect an informed insight into the military's world and a fine read, but please, go in well prepared."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"These books are great!

They help to explain the game a little more, but more importantly they show the before and after of the game. Understanding the origin of the Spartans and why the Master Chief is the only one left makes a real difference in understanding the game. They are well written, although not exceptional, which is why they score only a four out of five stars. Those who have not played the game will not enjoy the books as much because of the mediocrity of the writing, but they are still worth reading. The books are very military in nature and go to great lengths to explain different weapons, ships, and technology that are seen in the game.

The Fall of Reach is of course the most crucial of the four current Halo Novels. It describes the creation of the Spartan program and the necessity that drove it. In typical Eric Nylund style it colourfully describes the characters and evironments of the Halo Universe. I sometimes wished the games could slow down a bit to let you enjoy these aspects, but I guess that's what the novels are for. Another well written and enjoyable read going in depth into the minds of John-117, Dr Halsey and Captain Keyes. The Flood however, is another story. Written by William C. Diets, this novel is a banal blow-by-blow description of the first Halo game (hence the four stars). It provides very little imaginative back story and when reading it you can follow the game level by level in your minds eye; quite boring. I assume that he was instructed to follow the Halo game storyline fairly closely, but he could have spent a little more time describing what the flood were thinking or how they thought for that matter. Its not all bad news however, it does go into describing how other soldiers dislike the Spartans and everything they stand for. The descriptions of the flood minds inside Captain Keyes and Private Jenkins were good but there could have been more of it, even some backround history on the Flood and the Forerunners who imprisoned them would have been nice. In general this novel didn't seem to gel or flow as well as the other novels in this series. First Strike is another great story and gives a good description of all the other heroes in the Halo universe (Admiral Whitcomb and Leutenant Haverson et al). It tells us how we got to where we are in Halo 2. It descriptively illustrates how the Spartans live and work together as a family and how they rely on each others different attributes. It further describes how some other military personnel dislike the Spartans and how far the Spartans will go to fight for their survival as on Reach. In general these novels are a wonderful read and I think the Halo fans will enjoy them as much as I did, (minor shortcommings aside).Kyle Daniel Storm"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"THis was purchased as a Christmas gift to my nephew.

I enjoy military Sci-Fi and found these surprising good, able to stand on their own without the game tie-in.The three books are:The Fall of Reach (4 out of 5 stars) - the story follows the creation of the elite Spartans, from project inception to major battles, and gives good background information on the human and Covenant organization. The main focus is on John (the character you play in the game) but also covers other key characters that show up in the game. This is helpful as it fleshes out the game and makes the interaction a little more enjoyable.The Flood (3 out of 5 stars) - the plot again centers on the super soldier \\"Master Chief\\" (the leader of the Spartan II program) and the Artificial Intelligence Cortana, as they battle the Covenant and \\"other\\" enemies on the artificial Halo world. One of the more interesting aspects of book is a sub-plot that follows a Covenant Elite officer, giving us insight into the workings of their odd hierarchy. The book is almost worth reading for this alone.First Strike (5 out of 5 stars) - this book jumps around a bit at the beginning, weaving the story around the events in the first two books and then picking up from the ending of \\"The Flood\\". The main focus of the story is once again the Spartan John (AKA, \\"Master Chief\\" - a heavily armored super soldier) and the computer AI Cortana that spends a good bit of time living in his head. The battle against the alien Covenant forces continues against overwhelming odds. This time elements of both the human and Covenant hierarchy are explored in greater detail and I also enjoyed the insights into the other Spartans that are covered in greater detail than in the other books. The book ending makes it clear that there are more coming in the series.The writing is solid for the genre, not quite on par withThe Forever WarorOld Man's War(both of which I enjoyed) but much better than a lot of other mass market books. The development of the major characters was good enough but the ancillary characters are mostly underdeveloped. The action sequences are well handled and descriptive, without being too gory. Also, there are no real \\"adult oriented\\" scenes in the books.This is good military SciFi and does not require the reader to be familiar with the Halo games to enjoy!Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I bought this for my teenager and he has read them about 3 times each already since Christmas.

Or perhaps you've heard of Reach, of Admiral Stanford and you don't have a clue of what or who they are? Well here's a chance. This three novel pack explores the setting for the first Halo game.All the events prior to the battle for the ring (no pun intended), like the training of the Spartans. All that happens in Halo while the Master Chief is busy fighting the Covenant. The aftermath and the Chief's return to Earth. All of it you will find it in these three books.I must say that I'm a big Halo and science fiction fan, and these books may appeal to anyone who falls in any of those two categories. However, in my opinion the second book titled \\"The flood\\" felt a bit repetitive, especially when it told the story of the Master Chief. If you played the first game you might find those parts of the book a little dull.It is also worth noting that in an effort to portrait the chief superhuman abilities there is a little repetition of actions (especially in \\"The flood\\"). That's the only reason why I don't give it a five star rating.It is definetly not \\"Nobel Prize for Literature\\" writing, but they are always very clear, faithfull and above all entretainig!!

Eric Nylund and Willian Dietz are wonderfully artistic in their words.Fall of Reach might be the best of the bunch. it was interesting to see how the Spartan program began, and how the Holy War between the Covenant and humanity went along before the game. the climax of this book was the incredible Battle of Reach. i regard it as one of the finest moments in sci-fi writing.i don't care what everyone else says. i thought The Flood was also very enjoyable. yes, it followed the first game very closely, but if you're a true fan, you might wonder about the backstory. the skirmishes between the surviving Marines and the Covenant (and later Flood) were great. i also thought it was interesting to follow the Master Chief from a literary point of view.First Strike did a great job of bridging the gap between Halo and Halo 2. if you played through those two games, you might have noticed the gaping hole in the plot. how the hell did MC and Cortana get back to Earth? Eric Nylund explains it wonderfully.this trilogy was quite an adventure, and i know more books are already out. if you're into sci-fi universes or action-packed reading, this is the stuff for you."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"These books are great for any Halo fan fan and are very much informative about things like the spartan program.

It does have its few redeemable qualities, but any \\"scene\\" featuring the Master Chief or an event in the game feels mostly forced. It's like the author played the game through on easy, recorded what he did, and fleshed it out to make the central plot line. Pretty much every part that the author had to come up with on his own is good, but when considered as part of the whole it's just.... Not good fiction.The other two books are good in their own ways.I would suggest purchasing the books if you're interested in Halo."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"this book rules because you find out who th emaster chif is. sorry about the misspellings."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"This is not meant to be helpful to you, I am simply giving this item a rating."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"All three of the stories were written well and the plots unfolded in riviting fashion as one who had played the game would expect. However, with that said, I must state that one of my primary expectations weren't met, or even addressed.At the end of the first Halo game we see 343 Guilty Spark tooling through space, apparently unharmed from the final cataclysm that befell Halo. We also were left with the impression, from various pieces of dialog through the game, that like Neo (Matrix), the Master Chief (Reclaimer) had been down this road before.While I hadn't expected the prequel, The Fall of Reach, to provide much in terms of explanation of these open items, I did have full expectations that these items would be either more fully developed or even explained in the sequel, First Strike. Disappointingly, none of the open items from the first Halo were discussed.It would have been appreciated if the Amazon Review had made mention of this crtical ommission beforehand. I might well have still purchased the Trilogy but now I feel a bit cheated."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"A friend has this box set, so I borrowed the book \\"The Fall of Reach\\". Oh, dear God. I just thought the guy had no clue how to write, so he just slapped togeather a bunch of clich&eacute;s with WAY too much detail into stuff like how the guns are. Some of the things I read really bothered me, by how sick and uncreative they were. Like...\\"Please tell me how to win this game, just this once.\\"\\"In order to win.... you must survive!\\"Oh, Christ. What the hell is that? (Note, this isn't EXACTLY what was said, but close anyways.) So then, there's him blabbing on and on about how their guns are.She used an STS Plasma Warped Super-Charged Ultra-Comlink dual rocket charged bn 16893 12mm vox-chamber link maxed with visor attack blah blah blah blah....Yeah. So, if you dig that kinda detailed stuffo, and you know a hell of a lot about weapons, mabey you'd like this. But really, I was dissapointed, lost, and bored. Plus an ending I totally predicted from the first few chapters.Ok, but that's just one author. There's still the William Dietz guy.

Not novels) seem to be written by 5th grade students. Yes, the spelling was corrected when the books were published, but the description, dialogue, and overral quality offered is very poor. I've read some parts of every book and it's really hard to understand what is going on. It seems as if the writers were really inspired and concentrated on what the text means more than how the text is presented.Don't forget the fact that since the books were written by different authors there are many plot holes that make the story very hard to understand and will leave you saying \\"But why...\\". These books were only written to make some quick cash out of the portion of the growing Halo fan base that knew how to read and write.Conclusion: Don't buy if you know how to write & read properly. Otherwise you'll lose IQ points.If you want a novel were the battles are described so well that they make your blood boil of enthusiasm, read \\"If I forgot you, Jerusalem\\" by Pierre Barret & Jean Noel Gurgand."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Excellent series, would recommend to any fan of Sci-Fi, or video games.

This collection is good at fleshing out a very complex storyline that the games touch on.The Fall of Reach tells how John-117 becomes the Master Chief and leaves off where the first game begins.The Flood is actually the novelization of the first game.First Strike takes place between the first game and the second game.The writing is very good and it is written for the more mature reader as the game is rated \\"M\\" for mature. You do become invested in some of the other characters outside of the Master Chief and Cortana and what fate has in store for them.Books 1 & 3 have a deeper feeling to them, mainly because they take place with events happening between the games but book 2 does give you some good insight into the Helljumpers and Marines and gives characterization to them.I was hesitant at first because it is based on the games but they turned out very good.

Eric Nylund has that special something in his writing which engages the reader and causes him to actually FEEL for the characters, while at the same time delivering excellent, \\"can't put the book down\\" excitement. I highly recommend \\"The Fall of Reach\\" and \\"First Strike\\" to any SciFi fan, even if you're not a Halo fan.Unfortuntely, I cannot say the same for William Dietz's \\"The Flood\\". The middle book of the series just doesn't live up to the same standards that the first book set and the third continued. The action feels rather staged, and other than a few Marines, you never quite feel that close to the characters. While some of the excitement may have been missing due to the fact that I played Halo and basically knew what was going to happen, this book is still not as well written as the first and third. That said, I would still recommend reading it as it is by no means a BAD book.\\"Fall of Reach\\" and \\"First Strike\\" are, in my opinion, excellent reads. \\"The Flood\\" fails to hit the same mark, but is still an average-to-above average read."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"When i first played the game halo i loved it. The gameplay was great music was beutifully done and supprisingly the story was expertly told.So when a halo book came out i jumped on it to see the back round of the story. And behold it turned out great. But its no literary master piece. To compare it, its like reading a Tom Clancy novel. The author seems to have a technical name for just about every piece of equipment.So to round this review up if you like halo pick up the boxs set but be warned the series is written by two author and you may feel a chnge of writting inbetween the books, but its still all good."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"In the three Halo books, I found that I was able to expand my knowledge on what i had previously learned from playing these games.

I was skeptical at first. How good could some books about a video game be? I finished the first in 3 days and needed more. It's really cool to see the backstory of the game. I'm on the second book now, and it's not a narrative of the video game. I don't want to give too much away, but it tells about the resistance set up by the marines on halo, and let's you see the story from the marines' side and the Covenant's side.

She told me that she owned many better space battle books if I wanted to borrow any. But then again she has never played the games on XBOX.

Eric Nylund does an exceptional job here, and his writing style is crisp and concise and so much fun to read that I've often read this book alone without going on to read the rest of the books in sequence (though I have obviously read all of them).\\"Halo: The Flood\\" is definitely the weakest of the three. William C. Dietz's entry is basically the story of the first Halo game in written form, complete with all the exact same dialog and very little extra. It's not a bad book, but if you've played the game then you've basically read the book, just, without all of those words.\\"Halo: First Strike\\" is one that I haven't read often, but still love. It has a ton of information in it and is just as action-packed and well-written as the first Nylund book in the series, but it always sort of confused me. Still, this is a great book.Together the three books offer up over 900 pages of awesomeness, and if you're looking for more when you're done reading those, look up Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (also by Mr. Eric Nylund) and Halo: Contact Harvest by Joseph Staten.

It fills in a lot of the blanks about the back story you didn't get from the video game.In the first book, we finally learn why Master Chief's ship ended up at Halo. They were running blindly after humanity's strongest outpost fell to the Covenant. The story builds a great deal of suspense, even though you know what's ultimately going to happen.Book two mostly just follows along exactly with the first Halo video game. There is a tacked on story about an Elite hunting down Master Chief, but mostly it's just good to relive the game and catch up on some back story and missed dialog with Guilty Spark.Book three covers Master Chief's escape from Halo. It's the weakest of the books if only because it starts to run out of new ideas and replay the same fights over and over again. Still, it's a fun read and easily worth the price.When you get done with these, you might want to skip the sequel Ghosts of Onyx book (not as good), but be sure you grab the Contact Harvest which is a prequel to this set."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Any anticipation of what this series offers should be thrown out the window.

Great Seller!!!"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Sometimes it's hard to get caught up into something a few years after that something has become a big thing in today's society. The big thing I'm referring to is the Halo series. Many times it's easy to just say the heck with it and pick up on the next big something so that a few years from now, you won't feel so out of touch. However, being a Halo fan doesn't require you to be a member of some special club, no. It requires you to be you and only you.If you're a newbie to the Halo empire, you've probably already played both Halo games and fully understand why it's considered the best FPS game out there. There is more to the Halo story, however. Lots more to be exact. There's the backstory into how the Master Chief came to be. The novels are the true backbone into the Halo universe.The Halo Books are a breath of fresh air in creative sci-fi writing. With critical plot points now discovered, any fan of the Halo series can fully appreciate the official guide into the world of Halo and uncover why the Master Chief is such a stoic, determined character. Why the Covenant is such a strong, menacing force to be reckoned with. And why Cortana is such a brilliant A.I. The style of writing is creative and complex. With military terminologies galore, the story stays on course throughout and doesn't distract you with back and forth plot twists. Hey, if you're like me and don't know squat about military ranks, just forget about them and continue reading on. As an amateur writer, one thing I found extremely helpful were the timestamps at the beginning of each chapter. As a writer, the attention of your audience is what counts the most. Both authors Nylund and Dietz dance back and forth between stories in each chapter. Timestamps help you stay on course.Overall these novels are a great read and should help you become a bigger fan of Halo all together. With more novels on the way and the release of 2 more Halo games, the casual fan should have more the reason to catch up to all the hoopla on Halo."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"A very nice series that delvs into the very heart of the Halo games story, and fills out what you need to know.1: The Fall of ReachIt is a good start to the whole story. You learn about the spartans (the group the master chief is part of) came into life, and how the war with the Covenant started... partly it is still not quiet clear. You get a good detail of the events years before the the halo game, and what happend just before it starts.2: The FloodA good recollection of the game, you trace the master chiefs moves as he did in the game, but get more of his thoughts and feelings as he battles across Halo.In adition to telling the game again, you also get the story of the marines and the Covenant that you incounter several times in the game, and their fight on the ring. The book in this way closes a lot of holes produced by the game expirience, and sets your mind at ease and in ways makes the game better to think about.3: First StrikHappens directly after Halo has been destroyed by the master chief, and his struggle to find a way back to friendly territory. This book is the most surprising if you have read the others, you are constantly being thrown over by plot twist that you will hate and some you will love.The books are overall great there are some things that still bug me personally. There are some Deus ex Machina (God in the machine), which saves the character from death or some other ill event. Though this is needed for the book, it some times deminishes the muthos that the books create in the start about the spartans.But you would have to read the book to know what I mean.Plus the books are very fast to read, so you have to absorb much information very fast and keep track of what happens now."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Books for my kids, Their opinion is very positive, they have the games also, so these books complete the whole deal.

But I must say that these books have changed me for the better. The stories are entralling, and my imagination has been sparked back into action. These books are a must buy."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"These books are by no means great literature.That said, they are some of the most entertaining books I have read of late. They are very engrossing books (probably more for me as a fan of the video game than for a casual reader) and they are fast-paced with plenty of action.Being based on an action video game in the \\"shoot 'em up\\" style, this series of novels has planty of sci-fi warfare and a lot of military tactictal dialogue (which, though made up, tries to add to the authentic combat feel of the books). There is abundant action and more than a little gore which may put off fans of a more cerebral science fiction style.As I said, I am a fan of the game and I enjoyed the different perspective with which this approaches the events depicted in Halo: Combat evolved. It shows you the thought process of a man who was taken as a child and made into an ultimate fighting machine (Almost literally, as his combat suit makes him seem more of a cyborg than a human)The novels do step outside the combat zone, and the massive war between humans and the \\"Covenant\\", an alien alliance bent on the destruction of humanity. They delve into concepts of religious fanaticism, social hierarchy (certain races of the covenant have higher status than others), and the effects of extended periods of combat on a soldier.The most important theme explored in these books is the idea of the \\"Spartan Program\\". This was the secret program that created the books' main character \\"The Master Chief\\". The program was designed to create the ultimate soldier. It involved kidnapping 75 slected six-year-olds and replacing them with clones so their parents would be unaware. The children were then trained to become stronger, faster and smarter than any other soldier. They also went through several severe medical processes that enhanced their bone strength and vision, and made them into virtual superhumans.There is significant debate throughout the stories over whether it was right to take these children. There were many of the seventy-five who did not make it through the training. None of the children had a choice in the matter, and they were robbed of a \\"normal childhood\\".This moral debate is as philosophical as these books get, though. In the end what they are is an exciting series of novels with abundant action, and a fast paced story line that will appeal to any science fiction or action fan.If you like the game you will like these books. If you are unfamiliar with the game...you may still like these books"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Before I say anything I should mention that I'm a tremendous fan of the Xbox game on which this series is based. These books are a must-have if you were captivated by the awesome story and atmosphere that is Bungie's hit series Halo. Some minor Spoilers are below.This boxed set includes The Fall of Reach (prequel to the game), The Flood (novelization of the game), and First Strike (epilogue to Halo 1 and lead-in to Halo 2).Here's my opinion of each book in this box set.The Fall of Reach - if you watched the opening scene of Halo 1 and wondered about the origins of the Master Chief, Captain Keyes, Cortana, the Covenant and its various species, or Earth's colony Reach, this book gives you a fantastic backstory that gives greater depth to the characters you already know, and introduces some new ones.The Flood - So you think that because you've played the game you can skip this novelization? I think not. The Flood includes scenes (and a covenant species) from Halo that were cut from the final version of the game. Ever wonder where all of those human dropships in the game refueled and made camp? You'll find answers here. Writer William Dietz manages to make a simple novelization more complex and enjoyable than you may think.First Strike - After the Master Chief and Cortana destroyed the Halo ringworld, how did they manage to get home without a faster-than-light vehicle in order to warn Earth about the Covenant threat? And why was the fleet that attacked Earth in the Halo 2 videogame so small? Writer Eric Nylund manages to tie up all the loose ends from the Halo videogame and book and give us a great lead-in to the events of Halo 2.These books by themselves are excellent and have a lot to offer to any sci-fi buff, and they make excellent companions to the videogame."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I'm a Halo fan, and could see there was a lot hinted at in the back story of the game's campaigns. I hoped I might find out more at some time, searched and found this set.I read through all three books as fast as I could- only put them down when I had to. They were that interesting! This is a very affordable set, and you get decent value for the cost. I also appreciated that they reflect the game's \\"values\\"- plenty of action, heroism under intense and dire situations, much of what passed for \\"young men's stories\\" when I was younger. Not any romance (in the male-female sense, anyway) to speak of, but to me, that's a plus- it would detract from the feel of the story.This observation may be peculiar to my era (I was in high school in the late 60's), but these are the kind of books I'd be reading for my own enjoyment in my early teens. Fast-paced, inspirational, pure entertainment.Reading these books won't cure AIDS or world hunger. But you will understand the Master Chief, Captain Keyes, Cortana, Sgt. Johnson and the other characters a lot better when you're finished.In terms of what to expect, the first book \\"The Fall of Reach\\" covers the early history of the Spartan Project, the start of the war with the Covenant, and ends right at the start of the first game. You'll more fully understand the initial game dialogue between Captain Keyes, Cortana, and the Chief when you're through.The second book (\\"The Flood\\") covers the period of the first game, and covers parts of the game story. But it also includes additional content that again enhances and clarifies what you get in playng the game. It also suggested a couple of new ways I could play parts of the game, which was a fun bonus - \\"do it just like it happened in the book\\".The final book covers the space between the two games, and certainly maintains the excitment and interest of the first two. Find out what \\"Master Guns\\" couldn't!The middle book has a different author from the other two, and has a slightly different feel to it. But I still liked the set overall, and wouldn't split it up for the world.If you liked the Halo game's story, and want to know more, this is an essential choice- it will enhance the game experience for you. If you're looking for teen or pre-teen action stories with a basically positive view of humanity and virtually no sexual innuendo, also a good choice. There are plenty of things this isn't, but I'll leave that to other reviewers. When I get my copies back from my daughter [who also wanted to read them], I'll definitely be reading them again."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I started out not caring much about the Halo game. When Halo 2 came out, I got hooked by playing it with my in-laws. This past Christmas, I received a Xbox 360 and the third Halo game. I am so obsessed with the games and story, now, that I just had to buy the box set...along with the Ghosts of Onyx and Contact Harvest. The first three books are AMAZING! You have no scope of how intense the battle between us and the Covenant are until you read the books. You feel sorry for the soldiers and cringe at their wounds and deaths, unlike in the game where you don't care about anything other than staying alive and killing aliens. Then, if you've played the games before, you still don't understand the true horror beind the Flood until you read Master Chief's first encounter, and others' encounters, with them. To summerize, the story behind the games is absolutly incredible, and if you love the game, you will definately love the novels. Unlike some people who have given reviews, I see nothing wrong with the dialogue, story, or text within the books. The only trouble I have, is trying to hear the correct voice in my head when Master Chief speaks, since he doesn't talk too much in the games. Otherwise, again, absolutly incredible. Worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"The release of Halo three and its apparent success made me curious about these novels; so I picked up \\"The Fall of Reach,\\" a week later \\"The Flood,\\" and week after that I picked up \\"First Strike.\\" I am considering both \\"Contact Harvest\\" and \\"Ghosts of Onyx,\\" but I need to focus on work for a little while before I dip into Haloverse again.Eric Nylund is now one of my favorite authors, a close runner up to George RR Martin. Eric's interpretation of Master Chiefs' character is so insightful; he managed to conjure up a believable persona capable of conquering both the Flood and the Covenant. William Dietz did a fine job with \\"The Flood;\\" I can't imagine it was easy to create the novelized version of the Halo, the first game, while keeping it interesting and believable. Reading \\"First Strike\\" made it clear to me that these novels have taken the story far beyond anything I could have imagined, and it is great.If you are on the fence about purchasing this book series for your child or yourself, I assure you it is worth the few dollars they are asking. It appeals to all ages and genders.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Fall of Reach was such a good addition to the Halo story line. It details all of the events that lead up to the first Halo game, and how the SPARTAN program came to be.The Flood was, well, essentially a written version of the game. It's good in the sense that you get to see the story from the Covenants perspective, but it just drags on for some time as it details every shot and grenade that the chief fires.First Strike was, by far, my favorite of the three. It details the events that happen on Reach while the Covenant are glassing the planet.

Wherever there is a word that has the letters \\"f\\" and \\"i\\" together, they're missing; ie: file is le, and officer is of cer. I think there's a date typo too where it's supposed to be the day after and they didn't change it. It's a little confusing and takes from the read when you have to pause and figure out what's being said.

If you are a fan of Halo (or even if you are not) you should definitely pick this set up, seeing as it is such a good read for such a low price.I enjoy the way Eric Nylund writes more than Dietz, but both writers do a good job staying true to the Halo series.My favorite book of this set is The Fall of Reach, by Nylund.As I said previously, this set will be an enjoyable read that is surprisingly good for Halo fans and even those new to Halo."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I just recieved it, i'm very excited, halo is awesome the story behind it is pretty well writed, :P thanks Bungie :P"},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"The Halo franchise has always been one to impress me. From the moment I started reading The Flood, I was able to immediately remember the exact scenes described in the book from the video game. There are many nice additions, however. As a fan of the Halo series, I highly recommend the books because they fill in a lot of holes that the campaign of Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo: Reach never address.To the casual reader not particularly involved in the Halo universe, these books are probably not for you."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"If you are in any way, a Halo fan, you owe it to yourself to read these books.

Int he first book: Reach, the last planet before earth, has been wiped out. Our ships made a last stand but in the end failed to protect Reach. The last surviving ship was forced to flee into space. When they exited \\"Slipstream\\" space (folding space to travel great distances in a short period of time), we came across an alien ring. We landed here in search of security but soon realized that this ring was built by an alien race from thousands of years ago to house \\"it\\". We went underground to get supplies to fix the badly damaged ship in hopes to escape back to earth. Then the crew opened up a few doors that were locked for a reason, and let \\"it\\" out. They had let out a horror that they could not escape, run, or hide from. \\"It\\" is the most lethal force in the universe... we're not ready, \\"it\\" is. Want to find out what happens?

That being said they are a great read. I had played through both Halo games and enjoyed them but I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan of the game, unlike most I played it for the story not the online play.What I found was very good story telling and a very fleshed out world. All the books provide a good amount of background on the world that Master Chief inhabits, his friends, motivations and all the players you see little off or not at all in the games. All three books have a good pace and its pretty easy to flow through them. One of the disadvantage of having multiple authors writing books in the same world is that the characters will sometimes have slightly different portrayals that vary between the authors. Which can be seen in these three novels, its not distracting but you will notice it.One of the things I really enjoy about Halo, game and novels, is that much of their military termenology and presentation is very accurate when compared to our current Navy and Marine Corps. Anyone who has sent any time on a ship will see many similarities when reading through these novels, which I think is a good thing.I can recommend this series to the fan seeking good military sci-fi and the hardcare fan alike."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"These books are a great collection to read.

I am a HUGE Halo fan and these books are awesome. Anyone who enjoys Halo will be able to just jump into these books and get absorbed.The Fall of Reach: This is the first in the series. It is a prequel to the first game. This book gives you the story of how the spartans, and Master Chief, came to be. You also learn about all the other characters from the game, including Cortana. This is also the story of how the war between humanity and the covenant started. The ending of this book is right where the first game picks up.The Flood: The second book. This is the story that you go through in the first game. You may know how it ends but that didn't take any of the enjoyment out of the story for me. This also tells you what is going on while Master Chief is running around. Ever wonder where all the marines come from or where they go when Foehammer takes them away? This book explains it all. You also see the fight from the covenant's point of view, much like in Halo 2.First Strike: The third book. This is a great bridge from Halo 1 to Halo 2. You find out how the Chief gets back. You also find out how SGM Johnson survives, and why he didn't get infected. This also introduces the brutes for the first time. This is a great set up for Halo 2 and, like I said, lets you know what happened between the two games.This is a great series and even if you haven't played the games you will still enjoy it. It is a great read, written by two talented authors. Two more books have come out and if you like these then check those out as well."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"The books were enjoyable.

I had a change of heart though as I decided to purchase these books. When I finished all three, I realized that it had only taken me 6 days. I dove into the first book (The Fall of Reach) and was surprised by the creativity of the author as he unraveled the journey of the noncoms. Even though I had already played both games, I still wondered if the MC and Cortana would make it. My heart raced with theirs as the story unfolded. I couldn't believe the mind of this genius. I was a little disappointed with The Flood, though this author had a few more parameters to which he had to stay within. I was impressed with his creativity outside of what the MC encountered though, and I still enjoyed the book. Before I started reading First Strike I wondered if it would be the middle ground between Halo 1 and 2. I was rewarded my hope when I first started the book. The detail, situations, and most impressively the creativity that ensued soon had me enraptured, making this book my favorite. I wanted to go and start Halo 2 all over again just so that I could continue the story. I am waiting in anticipation for the next Eric Nylund Halo creation Ghosts of Coral to be released so that The carnage may begin again."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"Halo is a very good PC game. The game is what made me get into PC first person shooters. I have beaten the game many times over and over. The free multiplayer is great as well, I like the shield recharge ability. Gives a sense of temporary invincibility. Now the first book gives intro to Spartans, while the second concentrates on Halo, and the third is after Halo. Overall I like this collection and would recommend it. Just look at the price you pay for a very entertaining collection. Its not just for fans of the game, but does somewhat help to understand that there are a lot of military terminology tossed around. Just buy and read them all.

It dovetails nicely with the story in the game.The Flood is more than just a retelling of the game. It adds tremendous detail and good \\"story behind the story\\" that complements the game's plot well. There's a second story here as well, which is very good, but ends anti-climactically (it almost ruins the entire book).First Strike is a good action story. Not a lot of detail here, but it does move along very well. I feel the character development is also the best of the three in this one.The other complaint for all of the books is the poor editing. There are grammar and spelling errors throughout, to an almost embarrassing extent."},{"Title":"Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)","review":"I would recommend this boxset to those who want to know more behind the game itself since it tell us some stories we might have never know if we completely focus on the game itself.

As Fate may have it though my wife got The Fall of Reach for me because I could not wait for the Reach game. I was in love instantly, the book has so much to offer, it gives a totally new perspective on the Chief and the war, how hopeless it seemed. It gives the Chief a voice that he didn't have in the games, and a view on the fight that the game cannot give to the player. It will also introduce characters that are just a big a Hero as the Chief that you will remember. It is just so unreal how this changes my view on the game and the Halo Universe.

I found book #2 ok but I got tired reading John-117 shooting and killing covenants and floods, it was like reading the game and not a book, duhhhh!, maybe it's because I've played the game and read the book afterward, I don't know, still, I didn't like it too much. I found author Eric Nylund to be a better witter. He knows how to develop the plot and interlace all elements in the story very nicely. The sci-fi is neat and explained in a simple fashion, making it credible. In summary, you will enjoy this series.To complete these books I strongly suggest you read HALO: Ghost of Onyx.

Realizing that basically all is energy, I thought \\"electrical nutrition\\" sounded like an interesting concept. I found it to contain quite a bit of useful information. The authors discuss the value of eating whole, unprocessed foods, the problems with vegetarianism, the wisdom of limiting carbohydrates, how improper diet can lead to illness, the problems with vaccinations, and much more. Most of this information isn't new, though, and can be found, more ably discussed, in many other books.The problem I had with the book is the way the information was presented. The authors tried to take their \\"electrical\\" theories and wrap them around the entire work. I found very little, if any, substantiation for their theory. As a matter of fact, I found claims and explanations for simple nutrition that were just plain erroneous. The following quote shows one of the significant errors: \\"The fats in milk, butter, and cream are among the most beneficial protein sources available to the human body not only supplying important protein but also assisting to clean and heal the digestive tract.\\" Maybe it's just me, but in my world, there are three \\"macro\\" nutrients: carbohydrates (sugars), proteins (amino acids), and fats (lipids). Fats are not the same as protein. Proteins can be converted to glucose and then to fat by the body, but this didn't seem to be what the authors meant. This reference was made in several places. The authors even referred to tocotrienols, nutrients related to vitamin E, as proteins. In addition, when they wanted to substantiate something they were discussing, it appeared as though they would just make up some \\"fact\\" to \\"prove\\" their point.Another problem, and to me the most irritating of all, was that I felt as though the entire piece was an infomercial for the authors' company as well as a couple of network marketing companies they are associated with (Avena Originals and Royal Body Care). They continually mentioned \\"electrically formulated\\" and \\"electrically available\\" supplements (even an \\"electrically tuned\\" mini trampoline which they just happened to sell).All in all, an annoying waste of time. Those knowledgeable about nutrition, etc., don't need to read it, and those trying to add to their knowledge wouldn't know what was useful and what was inaccurate. I suggest looking at Dr. Mercola's web site for wonderful nutritional and related information. Also, check out \\"The Metabolic Typing Diet\\" by William Wolcott -- a great way to determine once and for all what specific diet is right for you. Lots of good science behind it and great to finally find a book that says there isn't one diet that's right for everyone."},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"The authors quite clearly state at the beginning that it was not intended to be a medical reference or scientific journal. It is new and leading edge info on how the body works electrically and so far there has been very little scientific research into this field. However, it certainly makes lots of sense to me to eat food that rots easily as that is what our digestive system does - assists in rotting the food that we eat. And as they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it and Electrical Nutrition is very digestible and palatable. Plus it works! If you want more energy, increased libido, and significant weight loss then try out some of the suggestions in Electrical Nutrition. It has definitely worked for me! Plus there are plenty of doctors who do endorse the work - at least nine on the inside back cover, plus some top doctors on the back including the retired head of research of one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. I really enjoyed reading the Soy Report - there has been so much advertising out there about the benefits of Soy that it was refreshing and insightful to read a contrary report, which was backed up by over 50 scientific references, by the way! Electrical Nutrition makes sense. It is simple and it works. I am not a great fan of scientific research as there has been plenty of public press highlighting the fact that research can be interpreted to suit whatever people are trying to prove, so just coz there is or is not scientific research backing up a concept doesn't hold much water for me! What is more important is - does this work? And yes, in my experience it does! An incredible book and an incredible read for everyone - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"The marketplace is flooded with books that discuss how to be healthy, how to improve spirituality and how to achieve enlightenment. Far too many of them ignore the impact of diet on these goals. We are a nation where 55% of the population is obese and where obesity is linked with severe health problems and early death. Despite this, medical and nutritional professionals are either ignorant of, or totally ignore, a plethora of research linking dietary practices to such problems. Too often, when they discuss diet, the present a narrow viewpoint, or glorify vegetarianism, which is not at all what people believe it to be. Denie Hiestand, the author of &quot;ELECTRICAL NUTRITION&quot; argues that heavy reliance on grain (especially our beloved wheat), and use of preservatives (such deadly additives as MSG and Aspartame) are major causes for destroying the health of our bodies and diming our spiritual lights. He also discusses vegetarianism, immunizations, the birthing process and other cultural practices that keep us from achieving our goals regarding health and enlightenment. Finally, as a psychologist, I have noticed how much better people function when they take a close look at their dietary practices. I have also been amazed at the results when Denie and I work with people with respect to all aspects of their electrical functioning. In brief, if you seek to guide yourself to better emotional and physical health, this book must be read!"},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"I was at my wit's end. I had a chronic digestive disorder that was slowing starving me to death. I tried everything. I tried The Zone, I tried the blood type diet, I tried vegetarian, vegan, no wheat, no soy, fasting, cleanses and purges of all types (god I'll never forget that liver cleanse), hormone therapy, etc., etc. I had a huge cabinet filled with thousands of dollars worth of of every herb, vitamin, supplement and concoction you could think of. Then a friend gave me a copy of Denie's book. Unlike anything else anyone had ever said, Denie actually made COMMON SENSE. Skeptical but hopeful, I changed my diet one more time. And 48 hours later everything started to change. My digestive system calmed down and I slowly began regaining all the functions that had been steadily deteriorating for years. It has been nearly a year since then and I am eternally grateful to have my life back. I tell you from my heart that this book will change your life. Do not hesitate for a moment. Buy it now."},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"Reviews of the book indicate it to be controversial and courageous in presenting new views. I read the book with the anticipation that it would present new and authentic information having a scientific and verifiable background. I found the book to be largely erroneous based on all standards of nutrition that have a scientific basis verified by population studies, university research or clinical methods that I am familiar with. In my view, statements are made in the book which would not be acceptable in a freshman biology paper. As an example, a bedrock assumption of the book is that the food value of food types is &quot;the vibratory rate that can be measured in terms of its rotting ability.&quot; The underpinnings of much of the book rests on the simplistic, gratuitous statements that the vibratory rate (undefined in any technical or scientific sense) of foods, and hence, the food value is &quot;reflected in amount of time it takes for a substance to decay.&quot; A significant section of the book is devoted to refuting the food value of soy, which is a restatement of a previously published one-sided view of soy products (Every health newsletter presents the pros and cons of soy products and every one has &quot;pros&quot; for tofu and soy products). It is not that every aspect of the book is wrong: certainly fresh, live food is better than food that is highly processed and filled with additives and preservatives. I didn't buy a book with this title to read that type of information. I found the significant and controversial &quot;points&quot; of the book to be unsubstantiated, vague, and unscientifically presented--and largely at odds with any viewpoint that I am familiar with that has data lending credibility and a scientific basis."},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"I notice that 9 of the reviews are posted by the same person, A Customer.

Initialy, it sounded like a goofy new-age waste of money, but i couldn't deny that my personal experiences back up a lot of what Hiestand asserts. The more I read it, the more I liked it. He looks at disease as a symptom that something more fundamental is wrong and this leads to treating the root causes, rather than just the symptoms. It helped me understand why things I have tried worked or didn't and gives a clear indication of what the next steps need to be to further improve health. The author is very bold in his assertions but he provides a fair number of endnotes to back them up. Definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"When I first started to make my way through this book, I was thinking this guy is a little off his rocker in the statements he makes untill I started to think about it.

I see things how I was told to think. Not the way they truly are. This book rocks!"},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"I have been reading books and watching various films on healthy nutrition for well over a year in a very focused way. I can say that I've almost all the most recent books and films for the past 2-3 years. Unfortunately, I've become very cautious on the ones coming from the US side, mainly due to the fact that most books and films have strong connections with a commercial setup of some kind: either the author has some vested interest somewhere or some interest groups tend to fund some of these efforts. Nothing wrong for people pursuing the commercial interests, but when it comes to the health issues, one has to act with double responsibility. In this book, I must admit, the beginning is very eye catching. The explanations, the references, and the points made are all very good. However, things start to change towards the end when the authors bluntly attack the vegeterian diet and things, like juicing, that have proven to be very healthy by scientific evidences. For me, the limit is at where they openly start to promote the animal protein based diet, which is very openly challanged for the past several years. And then you learn that they have their own companies promoting some of the products which they offer in their sample menus. And then they even pin point Dalay Lama as to how terrible he fell into sickness for the lack of meat and that he returned back to eating meat again. For me, after all the evidences available today against an animal protein based diets, I find it crucially wrong to write a book to openly promote the animal based protein, and it proves me the point that there should be some vested interest somewhere along. For me, the book looses its credibility when it starts to promote the animal protein. The rest is really unimportant after seeing these crucially diverted points."},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"I found this book on one of my daughter's bookshelves, observed that the foreword was written by John Gray, whom I so admire, then proceeded to read &quot;Elecrical Nutrition&quot; in one sitting.

I recommend this book to anyone who is serious about living life to the full, in excellent health."},{"Title":"Electrical Nutrition: A Revolutionary Approach to Eating That Awakens the Body's Electrical Energy","review":"This book is so filled with bull it will make you want to throw it away as garbage,for example the author's negative opinion of vaccinations,I viewed an interview of a Vietnamese man who was unable to get a polio vaccine in Vietnam because there was not enough vaccine to give to every child so every other child got it,he did not,and later contracted polio,so go tell him vaccines are bad.The author says jogging produces the same amount of toxins as the up and down movement is removing,then attempts to sell you a rebounder.As a long time jogger I can assure you I receive great health benefits from jogging properly.And it continues with New Age nonsense.Most of the concepts in this book lack scientific credibility and it is just a vehicle to sell you products you do not need,and health services from an unlicensed self proclaimed great healer practicing medicine illegally in his clinic.Who ever said the root cause of disease was the lack of products?As a licensed legal health care provider I suggest that emotiomal trauma,improper eating and lifestyle habits account for most of our problems not the lack of products.Save your money on this one,and go buy the nutrition classic booklet \\"Food Combining Made Easy\\" by Herbert M.

As a student of proper nutrition and as an author of a book dealing with energy medicine and healing, I know they are on the right track. Also, I appreciate them addressing the subjects of trauma and vaccines. If people realize the harm done to their entire systems because of the damage trauma inflicts upon them, they can seek ways of eliminating/ overcoming the trauma they have experienced. Surely vaccines are controversial because the \\"good\\" they do is all that we hear about, while the negative side effects are rarely discussed in the media.

The text is incredibly detailed in chronicling the entire history of all aspects of Project Mercury - from the first multi-g experiments on man to various heat-shielding techniques, rocket boosters, and environmental subsystems, and countless space schemes thought up by the military. The development of the program is quite fascinating. So comprehensive is the text that Alan Shepard's historic sub-orbital flight doesn't actually occur until halfway through the book.It's not a read for those just getting their feet wet in the history of space flight. This book is for those who already know the basics but crave every detail - all the early tests on man and machine and a full dissection of every part of the capsule.My only complaint is that \\"This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury\\" does not have an index. For such a comprehensive work of non-fiction, this omission is a crime. So many names and acronyms are mentioned in rapid succession that it's almost impossible to remember the roles of everyone. I keep a notepad with me to jot down names, acronyms, and page numbers, so that when I come across something that sounds familiar, I know where I saw it before. A glossary for the acronyms would also be a helpful feature. If a second edition of this chronology is ever made, it needs an index badly. I'd compile it myself if the publishers asked me to.Still, it's a well-worthwhile read for those who need to know everything about EXACTLY how we first got to space."},{"Title":"Buffy contre les vampires, tome 28 : La Tueuse perdue - Livre 4 \\"Bienvenue en Enfer\\" (French Edition)","review":"Actually, &quot;Original Sins,&quot; Part Four in Christopher Golden's &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; serial novel, offers not one, but two conclusions. In the future, Buffy and what remains of the Scooby Gang have their final showdown with Rupert Giles the Vampire King and &quot;returns&quot; to the present to correct the fatal error from her first encounter with Camazotz. With all the excitement about Giles becoming the king of the Vampires, it is easy to forget that Camazotz is an excellent villain to appropriate into the Buffy mythos and I think Golden deserves extra credit for coming up with two first-rate bad guys in the same storyline.Actually, I almost wish Golden had not put the two great villains in the same book, because I would have loved to have seen Camazotz and his estranged &quot;wife&quot; Zotzilaha, be more center stage, but obviously he is not going to be able to compete with Giles as the Vampire King. Actually, &quot;Popol Vuh,&quot; one of the Mayan sacred books, identifies Zotzilaha not as a god, but as a cavern, &quot;The House of Bats.&quot; Zotzilaha was home to a type of bat called Camazotz, which has been translated as &quot;snatch bat&quot; and &quot;death bat.&quot; Camalotz was also the name of the &quot;Sudden Bloodletter&quot;, identified as one of four animal demons which slew the impious first race of men. We all know much more about the European vampire legends than what happened in South America, but Golden has taped a rich vein of lore and maybe in the future Buffy will encounter the religious death cult of the Zapotecs that worshipped a bat-demon, or the soucouyant of Trinidad or the tin tin of Ecuador.Who says Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not educational?&quot;Original Sins&quot; is an appropriate title for this concluding volume, which certain comes full circle given that at the start of the story Buffy is trying to separate her life as the Slayer from her life as a college Freshman. In dividing that world she thinks that her friends belong with the later, which is somewhat surprising since I always thought one of the reasons Buffy has lasted so long as a Slayer is because she was not going it alone. You would think the Watchers Council would have figured out somewhere along the line that a Slayer with support in the field was going to last longer than one forced to go solo.The entire &quot;Lost Slayer&quot; series clearly takes advantage of the fact that it was written during Season 5 but takes place in Season 3. Golden clearly knows how far Willow has advanced in her wicca ways and he uses that to his advantage. I have always thought that it was the relationship between Buffy and Willow that is really at the heart of the show, and both Season 6 and Golden's novels prove the point as far as I am concerned. For those who enjoyed &quot;The Wish&quot; and &quot;Doppelgangland&quot; or have always enjoyed the DC comic &quot;What If...&quot; issues or &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and its various homages, &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is a fitting addition to the oeuvre. When these sort of stories are done right they are so good. &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is on the same level as &quot;The Gatekeeper Trilogy,&quot; and that, in the wonderful world of Buffy the Vampire Slayer books, is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Classical Civilizations, The Penguin","review":"A general view of the civilizations of the classical era, roughly from 550 BC to 500 AD.

However, he came to offer her a job to go undercover with him, and she agreed. Soon, the inevitable happened and they were running from danger and submitting to their passions. This is a sweet romance, and you really do like both characters. It doesn't have the snazziest of writing, and sometimes seems rather simple and slow, but the romance was a very effecting one. The danger and intrigue was not bad as a backdrop and kept as a continual focus where some other romance novels may leave it as a weak side story that's often forgotten when the passion runs high.

It's a pure pleasure to read: the writing itself is so sensuous, flowing over page after page of reflections and descriptions.

Eighteen years ago, and yet the language of this novel brings back all these memories! Wow! That's the power of books for you! The story he tells here is powerful as well; I could really relate to Will, the main character. I am reading this book slowly, savoring the beauty of the language and the gentle unfolding of the story.

I think this is definitely a good book to make me know more about what is love, and what is the right way to love people."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Un libro facinante, por su claridad y contundencia de conceptos. Describe muy bien los problemas actuales del hombre como individuo y como ser social para amar, y como ha ido compensando esto con formas de pseudoamor. Me hubiera gustado que profundizara mas en el &uacute;ltimo cap&iacute;tulo con respecto a la diciplina y la concetraci&oacute;n pero me imagino que ese no era el proposito del libro. Tambienme quede con ganas de mas ejemplos de neurosis debido a los conflictos paternos y como evitarlos, pero ilustra muy bien los ejemplos que da. Un an&aacute;lisis serio del amor como sentimiento y responsabilidad sin caer en cursilerias o formulas hechas muy recomdable para adolecentes y jovenes."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"No problem whatsoever , I received in 10 days for regular post office service but I dont care because I bought this book for personnal enrichment.
