This pivotal book explains how Burston and his medical team kept Allied troops healthy in primitive and hostile conditions and during the greatest medical emergency of World War II - the struggle against malaria. By keeping the soldiers healthy, and particularly by reducing malaria infection rates from 100 to less than one case per 1000 troops per week, the Army Medical Service assured an Allied victory over Japan. A Medical Emergency tells this remarkable story for the first time. In engrossing detail and using contemporary accounts, veteran historian Ian Howie-Willis brings to life the struggle of \`Ginger' Burston and his Medical Service to fight a deadly opponent that decimated the ranks of friend and foe alike.

The road was lined with fireworks stands, put together with plywood and scrap lumber, with hinged wooden shut-downs over counters packed high with brightly wrapped pyrotechnics from China. Hand lettered signs identified each stand. They seemed to be family enterprises. We later learned that the teen-aged son of each family was obliged to sleep in the shuttered stand with a .357 magnum tucked under his pillow to protect the investment from vandals and thieves. According to law, the fireworks purchased on the reservation must be set off on the reservation, but of course mainlanders came over and filled up their trunks, turning their own quiet neighborhoods into war zones, terrifying the family pets and invariably blowing off some of the little digits of their own children.

With a focus on three male protagonists living in very distinct urban areas of Cape Town, this comparative ethnography shows that men s struggles to become invulnerable increase vulnerability. Through an analysis of masculinities as social assemblages, the study shows how affective health problems are tied to modern individualism rather than African  tradition  that has become a clich  in Eurocentric gender studies. Affective health is conceptualized as a balancing act between autonomy and connectivity that after colonialism and apartheid has become compromised through the imperative of self-reliance. This book provides a rare perspective on young men s vulnerability in everyday life that may affect the reader and spark discussion about how masculinities in relationships shape physical and psychological health. Moreover, it shows how men change in the face of distress in ways that may look different than global health and gender-transformative approaches envision. Thick descriptions of actual events over the life course make the study accessible to both graduate and undergraduate students in the social sciences. Contributing to current debates on mental health and masculinity, this volume will be of interest to scholars from various disciplines including anthropology, gender studies, African studies, psychology, and global health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RODaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Software Engineering: Principles and Practice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9P7IzQEACAAJ&dq=Software+Engineering:+Principles+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passtrak Series 7: Principles & Practices : General Securities Representative","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gVGVPwAACAAJ&dq=Passtrak+Series+7:+Principles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion (Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Louis L'Amour","description":"An anthology of vintage tales of the American West features \\"No Man's Land,\\" \\"The Cactus Kid Pays a Debt,\\" \\"Ride or Start Shootin,\\" the title story, and five other tales","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8_Ga8oGn68kC&dq=Louis+L%27Amour&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fontamara","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bloodlines: Long and Short Stories","description":"Wexford has a headache: no-one seems to have witnessed the murder, and there is no evidence of any grudges being held against the victim.

There are even those who suspect that the last of the great Mages spent their final years scrupulously eradicating all traces of their craft from the pages of history--insuring that their art will never be practiced again. It is the dawn of a new era: an age of reason, science, and exploration, and Tristam Flattery is one of its most promising young naturalists. But when Tristam is summoned to the royal court of Farrland to try to revitalize a failing species of plant which seems to have mysterious, almost magical, medicinal properties--a plant without which, he is told, the aging king will surely die--he soon realizes that he has been drawn into the heart of a political struggle which spans generations, a conflict which threatens the very foundations of his civilization. And before long, Tristam is caught in the grip of a destiny which will lead him to the ends of the known world--on a voyage of discovery that has more to do with magic than with science....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XOc4tAEACAAJ&dq=Sea+without+a+Shore+(Moontide+Magic+Rise)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Humanist Manifesto 2000: A Call for New Planetary Humanism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Topobiology: An Introduction To Molecular Embryology","description":"If you had a complete copy of a dinosaur's DNA and the genetic code, you still would not be able to make a dinosaur or even determine what one looked like.

He was a founder of British Liberal Judaism at the turn of the century, considered to be the most original Anglo-Jewish religious thinker of his day, and still remains a highly controversial figure. Montefiore infuriated his enemies and often alientated his supporters with his radical agenda in which he applied the findings of historical and literary analysis to the Jewish scriptures, attempted to radically systemise rabbinic thought, and by his desire to learn from and re-express aspects of Christian theology. The extent to which he incorporated the teachings of Jesus and Paul into his own ethical and theological musings makes him unique among Jewish reformers. In his dealings with Christians and Christian thought, he can also be regarded as a forerunner to those who would later fully partake in Jewish-Christian dialogue. The Life and Thought of Claude Montefiore is an intellectual history and biography, together with an attempt to place Montefiore within the context of Jewish thought during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Controversially, it argues that Montefiore's own personal conception of Liberal Judiasm, which was never fully appreciated by his followers, should be regarded as more than simply a progressive Jewish denomination, and rather as an attempt to re-mould Reform Judaism in terms of contemporary liberal Christianity. Montefiore is an important figure in Anglo-Jewish history, not least for the way in which his complex identity reflects the difficulty inherent in attempting to make Judaism genuinely relevant to the modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UkAmAQAAIAAJ&dq=Claude+Montefiore%3B+His+Life+and+Thought.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finite Element Analysis (Wiley Series in Computational Mechanics)","description":"Built upon the two original books by Mike Crisfield and their own lecture notes, renowned scientist Ren  de Borst and his team offer a thoroughly updated yet condensed edition that retains and builds upon the excellent reputation and appeal amongst students and engineers alike for which Crisfield's first edition is acclaimed.

If a century ago it was women s sexual desires that were unspeakable, today it is the female desire to mother that has become taboo. One hundred years of Freud and feminism have liberated women to acknowledge and explore their sexual selves, as well as their public and personal ambitions. What has remained inhibited is women s thinking about motherhood. Maternal Desire is the first book to treat women s desire to mother as a legitimate focus of intellectual inquiry and personal exploration. Shedding new light on old debates, Daphne de Marneffe provides an emotional road map for mothers who work and mothers who are at home. De Marneffe both explores the enjoyment and anxieties of motherhood and offers mothers in all situations valuable ways to think through their self-doubts and connect to their capacity for pleasure. Drawing on a rich tradition of writers, such as Simone de Beauvoir, Adrienne Rich, Carol Gilligan, and Susan Faludi, as well as her experience as a psychologist and mother of three, de Marneffe illuminates how we express our desire to care for children. By treating maternal desire as a central feature of women s identity rather than as an inconvenient or slightly embarrassing detail we can look with fresh insight at controversial issues, such as childcare, fertility, abortion, and the role of fathers. An  absorbing look at the enormous personal pleasure that women derive from mothering .Maternal Desire is a stirring book that celebrates women s love for their children and mothering while also supporting their interest in careers and other pursuits  (Booklist).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mr2SDwAAQBAJ&dq=Maternal+Desire+:+On+Children,+Love+and+the+Inner+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kosher Yoga (Books of Oral Tradition, Volume Two)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D2FpAAAACAAJ&dq=Kosher+Yoga+(Books+of+Oral+Tradition,+Volume+Two)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The under dogs,","description":" The Underdogs will have young readers HOWLING with laughter, SNIFFING for clues, and BARKING with delight.

However, by the early 2000 s the bulk of scholarly and medical AIDS literature portrayed the epidemic as being largely under control, and claimed that Thai AIDS prevention efforts during the 1990s had been successful. Based on long-term ethnographic research conducted in Northern Thailand this book makes an in-depth study of the social construction of Thailand s HIV/AIDS epidemic over this period. In addition to his own field research the author draws on an extensive corpus of English and Thai language social science and medical HIV/AIDS literature to examine the modeling of Thailand s AIDS epidemic, and addresses concepts and issues such as risk groups, risk behaviour, alcohol use, gender and class, masculinity, the scapegoating of female prostitutes and men in the underclass, the reporting of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Thailand s indigenous Thai language media, and sexual activity amongst Thai youth. The analysis demonstrates the contribution of anthropology as an interpretative social science, and the use of anthropological theory and research methods, to finding alternative ways of framing the problems of Thai AIDS and of posing new questions that will lead to more effective points of intervention. It emphasises the necessity for critically reflexive approaches that question the  taken for granted  and demonstrates how qualitative research techniques guided by social theory have the potential to take account of local meanings in complex social contexts where traditional values and cultural practices are rapidly transforming due to economic and social change. The book offers a sustained and powerful criticism of the limitations of the normative model of the Thai AIDS epidemic and, in its aim of promoting critically reflexive AIDS research techniques in order to produce a better understanding of issues  on the ground  and hence better health policy and more effective AIDS interventions, speaks not only to the Thai AIDS epidemic but to AIDS epidemics throughout Southeast Asia and elsewhere. This is the only English language study of Thailand s HIV/AIDS epidemic to draw on long-term qualitative research in Northern Thailand as well as on a broad range of Thai (and some Khmer language) materials. Its contextualised and subtly nuanced analysis of the AIDS epidemic and of the impact of AIDS control initiatives, in concert with the theoretical and methodological contributions it makes to AIDS research and policy and behavioural interventions, makes it a timely publication of vital interest to scholars in the social sciences, as well as to the members of non-governmental organisations and international organisations working in the HIV/AIDS, health and development fields.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YxHdCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of heat transfer","description":"CD-ROM contains: Equations and relations (models) for thermal circuit modeling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dKI4k-9jK88C&dq=Principles+of+heat+transfer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2006 NFL Record & Fact Book (Official NFL Record & Fact Book)","description":"Gathers records and statistics, summarizes each game of the season, and lists the current schedule","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h010NwAACAAJ&dq=2006+NFL+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collected Poems (Bollingen Series (General))","description":"Includes some of Val ry's finest strokes of imagination, Broken Stories; some of his wittiest observations, Mixtures, Poems in the Rough; and even two of his great poems, Parables and The Angel all written in the form of prose.

It interprets and analyzes Calvinism as the first modern expression of an unremitting determination to transform on the basis of an ideology the existing political and moral order. Michael Walzer examines in detail the circumstances and ideological options of the Puritan intelligentsia and gentry. He sees Puritanism, in sharp contrast to some generally accepted views, as the political theory of intellectuals and gentlemen attempting to create a new government and society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pNYRVxTDpU0C&dq=The+revolution+of+the+saint%3B:+A+study+in+the+origins+of+radical+politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the Mating Dance to the Cosmic Dance: Sex, Love, and Marriage from a Yogic Viewpoint","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g4HXAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+the+Mating+Dance+to+the+Cosmic+Dance:+Sex,+Love,+and+Marriage+from+a+Yogic+Viewpoint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Men","description":"A portrait of strife-torn Northern Ireland chronicles the events that occurred when jailed IRA members demanded to be recognized as political prisoners in 1981, events that saw ten men starve themselves to death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gGQYb3GNGckC&dq=Ten+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing: a doctor in search of a miracle (A Fawcett Crest Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sl5GswEACAAJ&dq=Healing:+a+doctor+in+search+of+a+miracle+(A+Fawcett+Crest+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BOSS BR-1180 Quick Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Art of Nature Photography","description":"The latest digital photography techniques explained in concise detail.

The Romantic tradition that stretches from Keats to Harold Bloom exemplifies the former option. Neo-Christian, reader response, and new historicist critics assert a contrary, but similarly unbalanced, view by choosing the didactic authority of social custom, tradition, or ideology over the pathos of subjectivity.\\" \\"Resisting attempts to establish an absolute priority for either pathos or moralizing, David Mikics looks to the debate between subjective passions and didactic imperatives as a sign of the complex relation between literary creation and social norms. In a study that shies away from new historicist endorsements of the force of normative ideology, as well as late Romantic celebrations of the poetic self, the author finds that Spenser and Milton develop an innovative literary subjectivity under the pressure of the Reformation's moralizing aims.\\" \\"Incorporating moral force within pathos would allow poetic passion to become a worthy and clearly justifiable public stance. But Spenser and Milton, in their pursuit of this rhetorical ideal, find themselves acknowledging, instead, an enduring disjunction between affect and the discursive forms of public morality which aim to discipline or exploit it.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Food security has always been fragile, threatened by a variety of factors including plant disease epidemics. Several plant disease epidemics of the past lead to questions like: What happened? How did people deal with these epidemics? What were the social and political consequences? This volume deals with such questions in six selected chapters. Chapter 1 discusses black stem rust of wheat in antiquity, and how its epidemics were perceived by the ancients. Chapter 2 reconstructs a forgotten epidemic of yellow stripe rust, 1846, on rye, a staple food in Continental Europe. Chapter 3 describes the epidemics of potato late blight in Continental Europe, 1844-46, that caused the Continental Famine and - in the longer reach - contributed to the European revolutions of 1848. Chapter 4 studies the impact of plant disease on the food situation in the neutral Netherlands during World War I. Chapter 5 looks at belligerent Germany during World War I, ravaged by plant disease. Chapter 6 treats the problem of under-rating and over-estimating the effect of plant diseases on the course of history: the effects of ergot on political events in Russia, 1722, and in France, 1779, of black stem rust on wheat on the Russian Famine, 1932/3, and of rice brown spot on the Bengal Famine, 1943. This publication is of interest to plant pathologists, historians, economists and sociologists, interested in history, and with a focus on food.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EBLTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woodall's Western Campground Directory, 2005: The Active RVer's Guide to RV Parks, Service Centers & Atrractions (Woodall's Campground Directory: Western Ed.)","description":"Providing information on public and private camp sites in the western half of the United States and Canada, as well as Mexico, this updated volume includes detailed descriptions of each facility, easy-to-follow driving directions, local attractions, camping fees, restrictions, and contact data.

Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day is the helpful guide you've been waiting for to get your child out of diapers and turn the potentially terrifying process of toilet training into an effective and enjoyable bonding experience with your child. Teri guides parents to the successful one-day potty training of their child by teaching them how to: ? Look for the signs that your child is ready to be potty trained ? Make the potty connection by using a potty-training doll ? Create incentive through consistent positive reinforcement ? Use charts, quizzes, and checklists to help with every step of potty training ? Know when it's time to bring in a potty pinch hitter ? Complete your potty training -- no more accidents Once Teri teaches you her techniques, she shares her secret -- potty parties!

Teri has proven that a potty party day engages a child in potty training in a way that no other method has before -- by speaking a toddler's language. A party may translate to fun, games, cake, candy, presents, and prizes to a child, but with Teri's expertise, parents can use it as a tool to motivate their child to want to go to the bathroom -- and to keep on going.

He never envisioned a life in politics, let alone becoming the governor of Maryland. As often happens, life steered a different course. In 1954, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates and entered a political world where he would prosper for the next thirty-two years. He steadily rose from delegate to senator, from back bencher to committee chairman to majority floor leader, and from legislator to cabinet secretary to Governor. Pitted against better known rivals, hopelessly short of money and running a campaign staffed with amateurs, Hughes came out of nowhere to win the September 1978 Democratic primary for governor in what remains one of the biggest upsets in Maryland political history. Two months later, he was elected in the largest landslide in state history to the first of two terms as Maryland's 57th governor. In contrast to the rampant political partisanship and governmental paralysis so common today, Harry Roe Hughes took a workmanlike approach to public service, more interested in results than personal advancement. His record--major tax and education reform, protection of the Chesapeake Bay and more--is one of lasting significance to all Marylanders. He respected the policy-making role of the General Assembly and governed through consensus. He eschewed the political. His style reflected his personality and approach to life: decent, honest, efficient, low-key and businesslike. Elected in an era of political scandal, Harry Roe Hughes restored Maryland's reputation for integrity and good government--an approach that, sadly, seems quaint and old-fashioned by today's standards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WM04vgAACAAJ&dq=My+Unexpected+Journey+The+Autobiography+of+Governor+Harry+Roe+Hughes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robin Hood: A Complete Study of the English Outlaw","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Tile Book: Decorating with Fired Earth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Official Soviet AKM Manual","description":"This official military manual, available in English for the first time, was originally published by the Soviet Ministry of Defence.

The gold bullion payments were always shipped on the lead escort vessel of the returning convoy. In April 1942, this was HMS Edinburgh. She was struck by two torpedoes and sank into the Barents Sea, taking 5 1?2 tons of Stalin s Gold to the bottom with her. This is the true story of how Ric Wharton s company, Wharton Williams Ltd. (2W) found the wreck and the gold worth  50 million at the time. The salvage remains a world record for the value of gold bullion recovered and the water depth of the recovery operation. Ric Wharton has had a long career in the diving and salvage industry and this book gives a fascinating insight into the exciting world of diving salvage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6ykCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"D is for Doodle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Punic Wars (World History Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chemical Property Estimation: Theory and Application","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Doctor Who : The Fires of Vulcan (Dr Who Big Finish)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Skeet shooting with D.

And though she appears to be human herself, Eden is an alien, a Raka, distinguished by her golden hair and skin, and gifted with the ominous ability to kill without remorse -- and with total accuracy. That is, until the fateful night she has one shot to eliminate her target, a human slaver -- and misses. \\"Failure\\" is not in Eden's vocabulary. Neither is \\"partner\\" -- but that's what she is forcibly assigned after recovering from her disastrous mission. A sexy, steely-nerved human agent, Lucius Adaire enjoys nothing more than sparking the fury -- and rousing the desire -- of the fiery female assassin too proud to admit defeat. Locked in an assignment they cannot afford to lose, Lucius and Eden find themselves bound in two high-stakes, heart-pounding games: the sensual web of kill or be killed, and the erotic dance of seduction. Savor Me Slowly Mishka Le'Ace was created to be an undercover operative...literally. Her beautiful body has been mechanically augmented to give her superhuman strength -- strength she's going to need. Her latest mission sends her to rescue Alien Investigation and Removal agent Jaxon Tremain from torture and death. With him, she discovers a passion unlike any other. A passion she was forbidden to know.... From the moment they meet in a darkened cell, Jaxon craves her touch. But the machine half of Le'Ace forces her to do things she doesn't always want to do. Even betray him...and ultimately destroy him. Now Jaxon must battle the man controlling Le'Ace, and even Le'Ace herself, to at last claim the woman he's come to love. Seduce The Darkness The war between otherworlders and humans changed Earth beyond recognition. It also saved Bride McKells's life. Before, the gorgeous vampire was a target for every fanatic with a stake and a crucifix. Now, she's free to roam the streets -- and desperate to find others of her kind. One man claims to have the answers she seeks. Devyn, King of the Targons, is a warrior and a womanizer, and he makes no secret of how much he wants Bride -- and how dangerous he could be to her in every way. An avid collector of women, Devyn easily seduces human and otherworlder alike. Until now. Not only does Bride resist him, but she leaves Devyn feeling something entirely new...a bone-deep need bordering on obsession. Her blood is the key to curing a vicious alien disease, but helping Bride uncover her origins will compel her to choose between electrifying passion and a destiny that could tear her from Devyn's side forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iTGOAXvHj7IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Law of Torts: Examples & Explanations, Third Edition","description":"A favorite among successful students, and often recommended by professors, the unique Examples & Explanations series gives you extremely clear introductions to concepts followed by realistic examples that mirror those presented in the classroom throughout the semester.

Leo Strauss argued that the most visible fact about Machiavelli s doctrine is also the most useful one: Machiavelli seems to be a teacher of wickedness. Strauss sought to incorporate this idea in his interpretation without permitting it to overwhelm or exhaust his exegesis of The Prince and Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy.  We are in sympathy,  he writes,  with the simple opinion about Machiavelli [namely, the wickedness of his teaching], not only because it is wholesome, but above all because a failure to take that opinion seriously prevents one from doing justice to what is truly admirable in Machiavelli: the intrepidity of his thought, the grandeur of his vision, and the graceful subtlety of his speech.  This critique of the founder of modern political philosophy by this prominent twentieth-century scholar is an essential text for students of both authors.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oi2GDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Escaped From Steerage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hocus Pocus: Titania's Book of Spells","description":"Uses supermarket ingredients in seventy-five spells to attract and keep a lover, calm a hyperactive pet, soothe a stubborn child, and protect loved ones","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WJgGVLnIjf8C&dq=Hocus+Pocus:+Titania%27s+Book+of+Spells&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tunay nga bang \\"Sugo ng Diyos\\" si G.

The man caricatured as  Silent Cal  was a gifted writer. The New York Times called him  the most literary man who has occupied the White House since 1865.  One biographer wrote that Coolidge s autobiography  displays a literary grace that is lacking in most such books by former presidents.  The Coolidge who emerges in these pages is a model of character, principle, and humility rare qualities in Washington. The autobiography offers great insight into the man and his philosophy. Calvin Coolidge s leadership provides urgent lessons for our age of exploding debt and government power. Shlaes and coeditor Matthew Denhart, president of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, underscore those lessons in an enlightening introduction and annotations to Coolidge s text. This handsome new edition is the first to appear in nearly fifteen years. It includes several of Coolidge s greatest speeches, more than a dozen photographs, a timeline of Coolidge s life, and other new material.

Annemann is most famous for inventing and refining many of the standard mentalism routines that continue to be used by magicians today. Early in his life, Annemann began working as a railroad clerk and then got into showbusiness as a tenor singer and a magician's assistant. He eventually became interested in mentalism and used his invention and performance skills to become one of the most talented and respected magicians of the 1930s. Annemann perfected his own version of the famous bullet catch illusion, performing the effect outdoors. Accounts of his performance describe the feat as a dramatic effect wherein Annemann would collapse from the apparent force of the gun and then produce the bullet from his blood-drenched mouth. In 1934 he began publishing the famous magazine The Jinx, for magicians. The magazine was focused on mentalism, but also featured ground-breaking effects from other fields of magic. The publication of this magazine ceased after Annemann's death and copies of it have become collector's items. Effects from the magazine have been published in several books and manuscripts, among them Annemann's Practical Mental Magic. This book is considered a classic in the field of mentalism. Annemann was married twice and had a daughter by his first wife. His personality is the subject of much speculation. On the night of January 12, 1942, Annemann was scheduled to perform his bullet catch indoors for the first time. Before the performance, he committed suicide. Since the subject of suicide is complicated, we may never know exactly why Theo decided to end his own life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ur0MuQAACAAJ&dq=202+methods+of+forcing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Passtrak Series 7 Review: General Securities Representative","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5vMCaJQupJwC&dq=Passtrak+Series+7+Review:+General+Securities+Representative&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Computer Industry (Emerging Industries in the United States)","description":"Traces the emergence and development of the computer industry in the United States as seen in the economic, historical, and social context of its times from the early twentieth century to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tv8gZvoWNzIC&dq=The+Computer+Industry+(Emerging+Industries+in+the+United+States)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illness and Culture in Contemporary Japan: An Anthropological View","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"1-555-Goddess!

The Story of the Baader-Meinhof Gang","description":"First published in 1977 in the US and Britain to universal critical acclaim, Hitler's Children quickly became a world-wide best seller, translated into many other languages, including Japanese. It tells the story of the West German terrorists who emerged out of the 'New Left' student protest movement of the late 1960s. With bombs and bullets they started killing in the name of 'peace'. Almost all of them came from prosperous, educated families. They were 'Hitler's children' not only in that they had been born in or immediately after the Nazi period - some of their parents having been members of the Nazi party - but also because they were as fiercely against individual freedom as the Nazis were. Their declared ideology was Communism. They were beneficiaries of both American aid and the West German economic miracle. Despising their immeasurable gifts of prosperity and freedom, they 'identified' themselves with Third World victims of wars, poverty and oppression, whose plight they blamed on 'Western imperialism'. In reality, their terrorist activity was for no better cause than self-expression. Their dreams of leading a revolution were ended when one after another of them died in shoot-outs with the police, or was blown up with his own bomb, or was arrested, tried, and condemned to long terms of imprisonment. All four leaders of the Red Army Faction (dubbed 'the Baader-Meinhof gang' by journalists) committed suicide in prison.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LFvpAgAAQBAJ&dq=HITLER%27S+CHILDREN.+The+Story+of+the+Baader-Meinhof+Gang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quilt National 2003: The Best of Contemporary Quilts","description":"Presented on these exquisite pages are the most beautiful, most innovative quilts being designed today, all selected from the world-class 13th Biennial Quilt National Exhibition, a showcase for contemporary quilt artists who expand the traditional boundaries of the craft.

Why do we so often defend the very social systems that are responsible for injustice and exploitation? In A Theory of System Justification, John Jost argues that we are motivated to defend the status quo because doing so serves fundamental psychological needs for certainty, security, and social acceptance. We want to feel good not only about ourselves and the groups to which we belong, but also about the overarching social structure in which we live, even when it hurts others and ourselves. Jost lays out the wide range of evidence for his groundbreaking theory and examines its implications for our communities and our democracy. Drawing on twenty-five years of research, he provides an accessible account of system justification theory and its insights. System justification helps to explain deep contradictions, including the feeling among some women that they don t deserve the same salaries as men and the tendency of some poor people to vote for policies that increase economic inequality. The theory illuminates the most pressing social and political issues of our time why has it been so hard to combat anthropogenic climate change? as well as some of the most intimate why do some black children prefer white dolls to black ones and why do some people stay in bad relationships? Jost s theory has far-reaching implications, and he offers numerous insights that political activists and social justice advocates can use to promote change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VfLuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Gunboats and Minesweepers (World War 2 Fact Files)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lWUDLgEACAAJ&dq=American+Gunboats+and+Minesweepers+(World+War+2+Fact+Files)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Hot Couple (Record Book about Us)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Management Study Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SS4KAAAACAAJ&dq=Management+Study+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carol Ann Duffy (Writers & Their Work)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Saigon to San Diego: Memoir of a Boy Who Escaped from Communist Vietnam","description":"\\"When I was 12, I didn't think I would get past ninth grade. When I was 14, I didn't think I would live to my twentieth birthday. For me to be here today is a dream beyond my comprehension.\\" Set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War's aftermath, this memoir tells the story of Trinh Do, a boy fighting for survival in newly unified communist Vietnam. Trinh Do was born in Saigon in 1964. His father, a soldier in the South Vietnam Army, was taken to a re-education camp after the communist victory in 1975. His family was thrown out of their home, and Do took care of his mother and younger brothers. He struggled to stay in school; because of his father, Do faced constant prejudice from the communist administration. He was expelled for refusing to betray his classmates in 1978; soon after, his mother arranged for him to escape Vietnam in a fishing boat. After a perilous journey, he landed in Malaysia, where he spent six months in a refugee camp, and then made his way to the United States. His parents attempted a similar escape four years later and were lost to the South China Sea. This memoir tells the story of Do's generation coming of age in a brutal period of Vietnam's history and is illustrated with family photographs. Framed within a complex historical setting, it reveals the cruelty inflicted upon the populace by the Vietnamese communists for the purpose of \\"internal security.\\" An intimate portrait of daily life under communist rule and an examination of the political and military situation, Do's memoir describes the propaganda and repression through the words of a Vietnamese schoolboy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=knOuBAAAQBAJ&dq=Saigon+to+San+Diego:+Memoir+of+a+Boy+Who+Escaped+from+Communist+Vietnam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Listening Side of Prayer","description":"The art of listening to the voice of God may be one of the most overlooked facets of Christian living.

Sometimes it becomes evident that new science does not in fact solve old problems and, for that reason, the ethical issues remain.

The editors of this collection have brought together experts from ethics and law to bring fresh perspectives on the use of and research on stem cells. The chapters in this collection range across a number of different issues in the debate on stem cells, from the ethical dilemmas of conducting stem cell research to those of the clinical application of stem cell technology. Each chapter gives an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the ethical or legal issues at stake. The early chapters give engaging new expositions on the permissibility of using embryos in stem cell research, in particular challenging our views about how we view and 'construct' the embryo in debates regarding stem cells.

The essays consider developments within the religious traditions of Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism in over a dozen nations. What do individual fundamentalist movements regard as the foundations for and limits of knowledge? What do they understand the proper role of science to be? And how do their world views determine the application of technology? The distinguished contributors to this volume - anthropologists, historians of religion, historians of science, and sociologists - address these and other questions through a discussion of topics such as educational structures of Hindu revivalism, women in fundamentalist Iran and Pakistan, and the creationist cosmos of Protestant fundamentalism. In a concluding essay, William H. McNeill situates contemporary fundamentalisms within a world historical context. The Fundamentalism Project is a monumental undertaking by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that involves an international group of scholars. Taken together, the volumes in this series will become a standard reference for educators and policy analysts for years to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FoF5jCEepGkC&dq=Fundamentalisms+and+Society:+Reclaiming+the+Sciences,+the+Family,+and+Education+(The+Fundamentalism+Project)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consequences","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Summons","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 26, Jeremiah 1-25 (craigie/kelley/drinkard), 438pp","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Detective Duos: The best adventures of 25 crime-solving twosomes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6DYOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Detective+Duos:+The+best+adventures+of+25+crime-solving+twosomes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strip Search","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bay of Tigers: An Odyssey through War-torn Angola","description":"The Portuguese journalist tells the story of his 1997 journey from Angola to Mozambique, describing the war-torn landscape and people of the shattered country of Angola, where land mines outnumber people and misery is the norm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pUV0AAAAMAAJ&dq=Bay+of+Tigers:+An+Odyssey+through+War-torn+Angola&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relief Without Drugs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q2t-cgAACAAJ&dq=Relief+Without+Drugs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FLOWER OF LOVE","description":"Christie Rhodes, gorgeous but lacking self-confidence, just wants to be friends with suave Frenchman, Philippe Moreau, despite the sexual magnetism between them.

In fact, the origin of the forensic p- sician (police surgeon) as we know him or her today, dates from the passing by Parliament of The Metropolitan Act, which received Royal Assent in June of 1829. Since then, there are records of doctors being  appointed  to the police to provide medical care to detainees and examine police officers while on duty. The MPS has been involved in the training of doctors for more than 20 years, and has been at the forefront of setting the highest standards of wo- ing practices in the area of clinical forensic medicine. Only through an awa- ness of the complex issues regarding the medical care of detainees in custody and the management of complainants of assault can justice be achieved. The MPS, therefore, has worked in partnership with the medical profession to ensure that this can be achieved. The field of clinical forensic medicine has developed in recent years into a specialty in its own right. The importance of properly trained doctors working with the police in this area cannot be overemphasized. It is essential for the protection of detainees in police custody and for the benefit of the criminal justice system as a whole. A book that assists doctors in the field is to be applauded.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FDbjR7RU8T0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (Penguin Dictionary)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ten days that shook the world","description":"Account of the November Revolution in Russia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3G4fAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Court Case Summaries on Civil Procedure, 5th edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Microsoft&reg; SQL Server 2000 Performance Tuning Technical Reference","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Canadian Oxford Dictionary: Thumb-indexed","description":"We all use Canadian English every day: when we order a pizza \\"all-dressed\\", hope to get a \\"seat-sale\\" to go south during \\"March break\\", or \\"book off\\" work to meet with a \\"CGA\\" to discuss \\"RRSPs\\". Language embodies our nation''s identity, and The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, in its 1,728 pages,covers all aspects of Canadian life. Never before have Canadians been able to see their language, and themselves, so accurately and comprehensively described in a dictionary. The loggers of the west coast, the wheat farmers of the Prairies, the fishermen of the Atlantic provinces, the trappers ofthe North; Canada''s Aboriginal peoples, its British and French settlers, and the more recent arrivals, whether they came from Ukraine, Italy, South Asia or elsewhere - all have contributed to making Canadian English unique, and the dictionary thus reflects the great sweep of Canadian life. Itcontains over 2,000 distinctly Canadian words and meanings, more than any other Canadian dictionary, covering every region of the country. Whether you call your favorite doughnut a jambuster, a bismark, a Burlington bun, or the more prosaic jelly doughnut may depend on where you live in Canada, butthey will all be found in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. Of course, this is not just a dictionary of Canadian words: its 130,000 entries combine in one reference book information on English as it is used worldwide and as it is used particularly in Canada. Definitions, worded for ease ofcomprehension, are presented so the meaning most familiar to Canadians appears first and foremost. Each of these entries is exceptionally reliable, the result of thorough research into the language and Oxford''s unparalleled language resources. Five professionally trained lexicographers spent fiveyears examining databases containing over 20 million words of Canadian text from more than 8,000 Canadian sources of an astonishing diversity. Inuit Art Quarterly, The Fiddlehead, Canadian Business, and Equinox; the work of writers such as Jack Hodgins, Sandra Birdsell, David Adams Richards, andPierre Berton; daily and weekly newspapers from across the country; and, of course, the Canadian Tire catalogue - all find a place in the evidence of The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. The lexicographers also examined an additional 20 million words of international English sources. For many Canadiansone of the more puzzling aspects of writing is trying to determine whether to use the American spelling or the British spelling. Should it be \\"colour\\" or \\"color\\", \\"theater\\" or \\"theatre\\", \\"programme\\" or \\"program\\"? By examining our extensive Canadian databases, our lexicographers have been able todetermine which, in fact, is the more common spelling: colour, theatre and program. Favoured Canadian pronunciations have also been determined by surveying a nationwide group of respondents. Oxford''s thorough research has also ensured that new words that have recently appeared are well-represented.So if you''re someone who puts on your \\"bicycle shorts\\" and \\"blades\\" over to the gym to do some \\"crunches\\" for your \\"abs\\" followed by work on your \\"lats\\", \\"pecs\\" and \\"delts\\", finishing up with a \\"step\\" class, because you''re afraid that being a \\"chocoholic\\" who loves \\"comfort food\\" will affect your\\"body mass index\\" and you want to avoid \\"yo-yo dieting\\", you''ll find all these common words in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary. An added feature of this dictionary is its encyclopedic element. It includes short biographies of over 800 Canadians, ranging from Elvis Stojko, Celine Dion and JeanBeliveau to Nellie McClung, Lester B. Pearson, and Kim Campbell. It also contains entries on 5,000 individuals and mythical figures of international significance, and almost 6,000 place names, more than 1,200 of them Canadian. Indeed, all Canadian towns with a population of 5,000 or more arefeatured, and their entries not only explain the origin of the place name, but also include the population based on the 1996 census. With the publication of The Canadian Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press adds another work to its highly respected range of dictionaries, and Canadians finallyhave a dictionary that truly reflects their nations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tK8RAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Canadian+Oxford+Dictionary:+Thumb-indexed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cuaderno de trabajo de los cuatro acuerdos: Utiliza los cuatro acuerdos para gobernar el sueno de tu vida (Toltec Wisdom) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Korean Mother's Cooking Notes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Talk to the Deaf","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N3y2YgEACAAJ&dq=Talk+to+the+Deaf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best of Gay Adult Video 1998: Mickey Skee's Dirty Dozens","description":"The Best of Gay Adult Video 1998 is the first edition in an annual series devoted to selecting for the reader the top gay adult videos in the top 12 categories.

But just as thoroughly, culture saturates oil. So what exactly is  oil culture ? This book pursues an answer through petrocapitalism s history in literature, film, fine art, wartime propaganda, and museum displays. Investigating cultural discourses that have taken shape around oil, these essays compose the first sustained attempt to understand how petroleum has suffused the Western imagination. The contributors to this volume examine the oil culture nexus, beginning with the whale oil culture it replaced and analyzing literature and films such as Giant, Sundown, Bernardo Bertolucci s La Via del Petrolio, and Ben Okri s  What the Tapster Saw ; corporate art, museum installations, and contemporary photography; and in apocalyptic visions of environmental disaster and science fiction. By considering oil as both a natural resource and a trope, the authors show how oil s dominance is part of culture rather than an economic or physical necessity. Oil Culture sees beyond oil capitalism to alternative modes of energy production and consumption.

Much less is known about the governess in reality. This book is the first rounded exploration of what the life of the home schoolroom was actually like. Drawing on original diaries and a variety of previously undiscovered sources, Kathryn Hughes describes why the period 1840-80 was the classic age of governesses. She examines their numbers, recruitment, teaching methods, social position and prospects. The governess provides a key to the central Victorian concept of the lady. Her education consisted of a series of accomplishments designed to attract a husband able to keep her in the style to which she had become accustomed from birth. Becoming a governess was the only acceptable way of earning money open to a lady whose family could not support her in leisure. Being paid to educate another woman's children set in play a series of social and emotional tensions. The governess was a surrogate mother, who was herself childless, a young woman whose marriage prospects were restricted, and a family member who was sometimes mistaken for a servant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a28-mVjG-4wC&dq=The+Victorian+Governess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Justice","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wild About Muffins","description":"A collection of more than one hundred simple recipes includes thorough and easy-to-follow instructions for the creation of delicious muffins of all sizes and varieties in under an hour, all accompanied by beautiful colored illustrations.

Dead Man s Walk As young Texas Rangers, Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call--\\"Gus\\" and \\"Call\\" for short--have much to learn about survival in a land fraught with perils: not only the blazing heat and raging tornadoes, roiling rivers and merciless Indians, but also the deadly whims of soldiers. On their first expeditions--led by incompetent officers and accompanied by the robust, dauntless whore known as the Great Western--they will face death at the hands of the cunning Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump and the silent Apache Gomez. They will be astonished by the Mexican army. And Gus will meet the love of his life. Comanche Moon Texas Rangers August McCrae and Woodrow Call, now in their middle years, are still figuring out how to deal with the ever-increasing tensions of adult life--Gus with his great love, Clara Forsythe, and Call with Maggie Tilton, the young whore who loves him--when they sign up to pursue the Comanche horse thief Kicking Wolf into Mexico. On this mission their captain, Inish Scull, is captured by the brutally cruel Mexican bandit Ahumado, and Gus and Call must come to the rescue, with the aid of new friends including Joshua Deets, Jake Spoon, and Pea Eye Parker, as well as the renowned Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. Lonesome Dove Gus and Call, now retired from the Texas Rangers and settled in the border town of Lonesome Dove running the Hat Creek Cattle Company, are visited by their old friend Jake Spoon, who convinces Gus and Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them north to Montana in order to start a cattle ranch in untouched territory. Gus is further motivated by a desire to see the love of his life, Clara Allen (nee Forsythe), who now lives with her children and comatose horse-trader husband in Ogallala, Nebraska. On the way to Montana they travel through wild country full of thieves, murderers, and a lifetime's worth of unforgettable adventure. Streets of Laredo Woodrow Call is back in Texas, a Ranger once again and a general gun-for-hire, but increasingly a relic as the westward sprawl of the railroads rapidly settles the once lawless frontier. Hired by a railroad tycoon to hunt down a dangerous bandit named Joey Garza, Call sets out once again with a hapless Yankee named Ned Brookshire who works for the railroad company that hired Call. Call's old friend Pea Eye Parker--who initially refused to join the expedition because of his family--sets off with the Kickapoo tracker Famous Shoes to try to catch up with Call, until he runs into troubles of his own. The long pursuit of Garza leads them all across the last wild stretches of the West into a hellhole known as Crow Town and, finally, into the vast, relentless plains of the Texas frontier.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rZohf4RlkCQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Search for Messiah","description":"Examine Powerful New Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls as well as the beliefs of the ancient Rabbis and discover the identity of the true Messiah!obiography of hope for the city, love for God and a faith that stays the course.

Hart argues for a security of the commons, emphasizing that the new security will require a shield for the homeland as well as a cloak of non-military security, including security of income, community, environment, and energy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LcYL1lbzoKcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Confederate Staff Officer: From Bethel to Bentonville (Civil War Heritage Series, V. 13)","description":"Major James Ratchford's reminiscences, unrevealed for more than one hundred years, provide a different perspective on the generals he served and the more than thirty engagements he survived. As adjutant general to Daniel Harvey Hill, John B. Hood, and Stephen D. Lee, Ratchford participated in major battles in the East, such as Fredericksburg and the Seven Days, witnessed the siege of Atlanta, and finally surrendered with Joseph E. Johnston's army at Greensboro, North Carolina, in April 1865. Professor Sieburg, Ratchford's granddaughter, has edited her ancestor's accounts of his close contacts with such Confederate leaders as Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson, as well as his descriptions of the combat soldier's life. Ratchford's job as a courier enabled him to shed new light on the famous lost dispatch, which many believe led to the Confederate defeat at Antietam (Sharpsburg). Major Ratchford claimed little knowledge of the larger military picture, but describes in a simple, straightforward style the humor, heroism, and honor which were part of that epic conflict.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zt3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Confederate+Staff+Officer:+From+Bethel+to+Bentonville+(Civil+War+Heritage+Series,+V.+13)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trilogy Scrapbook: The Rebel Alliance (Star Wars Trilogy Scrapbook)","description":"Featuring photos and scenes from all three Star Wars movies, a young fan's scrapbook celebrates Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and the other members of the Rebel Alliance.

Urry argues that there are major advantages in thinking about global processes in this way. The idea of complexity emphasizes that systems are balanced between order and chaos, that a system does not necessarily move towards equilibrium and that events are both unpredictable and irreversible in their effects. Hence specific events can have unexpected effects, often distant in time and space from where they occurred. This book combines new theory with many illustrations of how global processes operate. Urry distinguishes between 'global networks' and 'global fluids', and shows how forms of global emergence develop from the complex relationships between these networks and fluids. He draws out the implications of global complexity for our understanding of social order and argues that complexity requires us to reformulate the main categories of sociology and to reject any globalization thesis that is over-unified, dominant and unambiguous in its effects. Global systems are always 'on the edge of chaos'. This book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of sociology, politics, geography and economics and to and to all those concerned with rethinking the nature of globalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8h0Xk4JGS4QC&dq=Global+Complexity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's tragedies","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O88yAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The unprejudiced palate","description":"First issued in 1948, when soulless minute steaks and quick casseroles were becoming the norm, The Unprejudiced Palate inspired a seismic culinary shift in how America eats.

From the world's leading forest ecologist who forever changed how people view trees and their connections to one another and to other living things in the forest a moving, deeply personal journey of discovery Suzanne Simard is a pioneer on the frontier of plant communication and intelligence; her TED talks have been viewed by more than 10 million people worldwide. In this, her first book, now available in paperback, Simard brings us into her world, the intimate world of the trees, in which she brilliantly illuminates the fascinating and vital truths--that trees are not simply the source of timber or pulp, but are a complicated, interdependent circle of life; that forests are social, cooperative creatures connected through underground networks by which trees communicate their vitality and vulnerabilities with communal lives not that different from our own. Simard writes--in inspiring, illuminating, and accessible ways how trees, living side by side for hundreds of years, have evolved, how they learn and adapt their behaviors, recognize neighbors, compete and cooperate with one another with sophistication, characteristics ascribed to human intelligence, traits that are the essence of civil societies--and at the center of it all, the Mother Trees: the mysterious, powerful forces that connect and sustain the others that surround them. And Simard writes of her own life, born and raised into a logging world in the rainforests of British Columbia, of her days as a child spent cataloging the trees from the forest and how she came to love and respect them. And as she writes of her scientific quest, she writes of her own journey, making us understand how deeply human scientific inquiry exists beyond data and technology, that it is about understanding who we are and our place in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KE32DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sound Forge Power!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Queen of Spades and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YltdnQAACAAJ&dq=The+Queen+of+Spades+and+Other+Stories+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Men Before the Storm: Arba Crane's Recollection of Dred Scott And the Supreme Court Case That Started the Civil War","description":"In the early 1850s, Arba Crane, a young Harvard Law School graduate, arrived in St Louis to begin his law career. Working alone late in the evenings, Crane forms a friendship with the office janitor, a slave named Dred Scott. As Scott recounts his life as a slave, Crane realizes that Scott has a legal claim to freedom and persuades him to file a lawsuit. Crane fights for Scott's rights for years. The case reaches the US Supreme Court before a spellbound country. But the Court's catastrophic decision in Scott v. Sandford holds that slaves are property without rights and that Congress has no power to halt the spread of slavery. While the decision marks the beginning of the path to civil war, it is not the end of Dred Scott's quest for freedom.

Eugene Schwartz presents an incisive analysis of the ways in which the errors of the first third of our century have come back to haunt us at the century's end. After carefully examining Sigmund Freud's tragic misunderstanding of childhood and tracing its consequences for today's parents and educators, the author points to the radically new paradigm of childhood development offered by Rudolf Steiner and embodied in Waldorf education. Parents, teachers, and child psychologists will find a wealth of insight concerning such diverse subjects as the nature of play, the causes of ADHD, computers as teachers, and the power that love and imagination will have in the education of the Millennial Child.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZgjaBjKB0AAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rent veil","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Twelfth of August;: The story of Buford Pusser","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gpu Gems: Programming Techniques, Tips and Tricks for Real-Time Graphics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rinehart Lifts","description":"Disappointed that her best friend is the worst athlete in the fifth grade, Zan Hagen interests Arthur Rinehart in lifting weights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AH8_GwAACAAJ&dq=Rinehart+Lifts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Guide To Shark Etiquette: The Third Sherman's Lagoon Collection","description":"A collection of comics features Sherman the shark, Fillmore the turtle, and their undersea friends as they terrorize vacationers, go camping, and take cooking classes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ThtwGLKhSJYC&dq=The+Illustrated+Guide+To+Shark+Etiquette:+The+Third+Sherman%27s+Lagoon+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cicero: Pro Archia Poeta Oratio (Latin Edition)","description":"Pro Archia was delivered by Cicero in defense of A.

Why do we spend so much time and money managing and medicating it, and training ourselves and our children to do it correctly? In Wild Nights, Benjamin Reiss finds answers in sleep's hidden history--one that leads to our present, sleep-obsessed society, its tacitly accepted rules, and their troubling consequences. Today we define a good night's sleep very narrowly: eight hours in one shot, sealed off in private bedrooms, children apart from parents. But for most of human history, practically no one slept this way. Tracing sleep's transformation since the dawn of the industrial age, Reiss weaves together insights from literature, social and medical history, and cutting-edge science to show how and why we have tried and failed to tame sleep. In lyrical prose, he leads readers from bedrooms and laboratories to factories and battlefields to Henry David Thoreau's famous cabin at Walden Pond, telling the stories of troubled sleepers, hibernating peasants, sleepwalking preachers, cave-dwelling sleep researchers, slaves who led nighttime uprisings, rebellious workers, spectacularly frazzled parents, and utopian dreamers. We are hardly the first people, Reiss makes clear, to chafe against our modern rules for sleeping. A stirring testament to sleep's diversity, Wild Nights offers a profound reminder that in the vulnerability of slumber we can find our shared humanity. By peeling back the covers of history, Reiss recaptures sleep's mystery and grandeur and offers hope to weary readers: as sleep was transformed once before, so too can it change today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b0s_DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacob's Magic Box Discovery Series (Pack of 10)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6q4PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Jacob%27s+Magic+Box+Discovery+Series+(Pack+of+10)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pictures 0-6 Months (First Focus, 0-6 Months)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Koevoet!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The grape cure: For cancer and other diseases","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aIPLGwAACAAJ&dq=The+grape+cure:+For+cancer+and+other+diseases&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Days We Would Rather Know: Poems","description":"Now back in print after more than 20 years, Michael Blumenthal's Days We Would Rather Know, originally published by Viking-Penguin and sold out in both its original printings, was one of the most admired, and most influential, books of American poetry of the l980s, and marked the auspicious continuation of one of the decade's most promising debuts. Of Michael Blumenthal's first book, Sympathetic Magic, Howard Nemerov said, \\"The last first book I remember as having this strangeness and distinction was called Harmonium.\\" That comparison to the work of Wallace Stevens was, if anything, more apt in the case of this astonishing second collection, a collection that helped establish Mr. Blumenthal as a master of language in his own right. He worked his brand of magic with unforgettable imagery (\\"When your wife uttered your son like a large syllable into this world\\"), a lambent humor (\\"I wish Robert Rauschenberg would take back his bathtub and his floating goat\\"), and a playful eroticism (\\"My mouth puddles with bourbon and the taste of your thighs\\"). He revealed a sensibility that conflates the present with the past, irreverently aligning psychiatrists, baseball, and word processor courses alongside Odysseus, Rapunzel, and Rembrandt, and that lavishes on its subjects a vigorous and refreshing sensuality. While different in scope, subject, and style, these seventy poems all body forth a central theme: that-as reality is dissatisfying and satisfaction elusive-hope is in itself an antidote, and possibility is always invigorating. \\"Love is rarely as exciting as the wish for love,\\" writes Blumenthal; Days We Would Rather Know suggests that we are as fulfilled, as animated, by our longing as by the resolution of those wishes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WWsgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Days+We+Would+Rather+Know:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anybody Can Do Anything","description":" The best thing about the Depression was the way it reunited our family and gave my sister Mary a real opportunity to prove that anybody can do anything, especially Betty.

Du Bois was a public intellectual, sociologist, and activist on behalf of the African American community. He profoundly shaped black political culture in the United States through his founding role in the NAACP, as well as internationally through the Pan-African movement. Du Bois's sociological and historical research on African-American communities and culture broke ground in many areas, including the history of the post-Civil War Reconstruction period. Du Bois was also a prolific author of novels, autobiographical accounts, innumerable editorials and journalistic pieces, and several works of history. Published posthumously in 1968, The Autobiography of W. E. B. Du Bois is his last and most complete autobiography. Covering his life over almost a century of living in America, it's the closest thing we have to a true autobiography of this important scholar and activist. The book, broken up into three parts, delves into the 90-year-old Du Bois's thoughts on everything from his relationship with sex to his storied association with the NAACP to his political persecution during the Cold War years to his many travels abroad. As Du Bois writes, he takes the reader on a journey to \\"view my life as frankly and fully as I can.\\" With a series introduction by editor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and an introduction by Werner Sollors, this edition is essential for anyone interested in African American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMA8ngEACAAJ&dq=Autobiography+of+W.E.B.+Dubois:+A+Soliloquy+on+Viewing+My+Life+from+the+Last+Decade+of+Its+First+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children Of Lir","description":"In our little green Ireland in days of old A story of magic and courage was told There once stood a fortress, four children lived here Along with their father, the mighty King Lir ...

Whether they are called saints, gurus, tzaddiks, or shamans, there have always been people who possess exceptional insight, altruism, and charisma. In this disarmingly inspirational book, Gallagher investigates what ordinary people trying to live decent, meaningful lives can learn from such extraordinary men and women, who are specially attuned to the deepest truths, and who exemplify-and radiate-spiritual genius. In a clear-eyed, ecumenical approach that's free of dogma and bias and suffused with profound respect, Winifred Gallagher highlights the common wisdom-and down-to-earth good humor-of these religious leaders, revels in their differences, and identifies the capacity for spiritual genius that all of us share with them. On an island in the Arabian Sea, Gallagher visits Mata Amritanandamayi, regarded by devotees as a Hindu goddess, who transmits divine love through hugs and charities. She travels through America's inner cities with Tony Campolo, an Evangelical preacher who counsels national leaders and serves the poor. She learns how Riffat Hassan, a Pakistani theologian, uses the Qur an to defend the rights of her Muslim sisters. She journeys to a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the Himalayas to understand how an exiled minority has enchanted the world with their deep, resilient spirituality. In these diverse lives, Gallagher argues, we can glimpse our own potential for spiritual genius writ large. Each story testifies to the profound good in the world, even during a troubled time, and to Gallagher s groundbreaking theory of a human capacity for finding life s meaning that is nothing less than genius.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qhWIxjfAnzIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Barforth Women","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tye8AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Barforth+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The house of souls,","description":"The Great God Pan and 'The White People' are classics of the horror genre, while The Inmost Light is more conventional, but still a damn good piece.

Spunky, strong-willed, and too smart for her own good, Zippy Jarvis brought readers delight and joy. In She Got Up Off the Couch, Haven Kimmel invites us to rejoin the quirky and hilarious Jarvis family saga. Zippy is growing up and struggling with both her hair and her distaste for shoes. But this memoir strikes a deeper and more emotional chord, as now Kimmel shines the spotlight on her remarkable mother, Delonda. Courageous and steadfast, Delonda finally realized that she could change her life, and she got up off the funky couch in the den, bought a beat-up flower power VW bug (and then learned to drive it), and went back to school, which gave her the chance to gain both financial independence and, at long last, self-respect. A true pleasure for old fans and new ones alike, She Got Up Off the Couch is a gorgeous encapsulation of an innocent time when a child didn't understand that her mother was depressed or felt stifled, but just noted on her way out the door that Delonda was a fixture in the living room. Kimmel captures the seminal moments of her mother's burgeoning empowerment with the full strength of her distinctive, deft storytelling, and with the overflowing sense of humor that made A Girl Named Zippy a favorite of readers everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rzFBXpkm4JIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love, skill, and mystery;: A handbook to marriage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pmdJGQAACAAJ&dq=Love,+skill,+and+mystery%3B:+A+handbook+to+marriage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Migrations of the Heart","description":"Distinguished author and television executive Marita Golden writes movingly about her life -- first as a black activist in the sixties in her hometown Washington, D.C., then as a journalism student in New York. In those turbulent years, she gained a profound understanding of what it means to be black in America. While studying in America, she met Femi, an African man. They fell in love and she journeyed to Nigeria to become his wife. In Africa, plunged into a culture so very different from her own, but one she felt she should understand, Marita Golden learned about both her own new sprawling Nigerian family and Nigeria's large American community. But Femi, once her strength, began to insist she fit herself into the strict mold of his society and assume the submissive role of a Nigerian wife. In her new, strange surroundings, Marita Golden discovered that home is not simply a destination, but rather something you must carry always inside you. \\"A marvelous journey . . . powerful imagery . . . distinctly drawn characters come alive, events pulsate with energy.\\" -- The Washington Post Book World","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mjeymz4jpb4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The great awakening;: A history of the revival of religion in the time of Edwards and Whitefield","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cMoeKZNXFlcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long Way Back to the River Kwai: Memories Of World War II","description":"Loet Velmans was seventeen when the Germans invaded Holland. He and his family fled to London on the Dutch Coast Guard cutter Seaman s Hope and then sailed to the Dutch East Indies now Indonesia where he joined the Dutch army. In March 1942, the Japanese invaded the archipelago and made prisoners of the Dutch soldiers. For the next three and a half years Velmans and his fellow POWs toiled in slave labor camps, building a railroad through the dense jungle on the Burmese-Thailand border so the Japanese could invade India. Some 200,000 POWs and slave laborers died building this Death Railway. Velmans, though suffering from malaria, dysentery, malnutrition, and unspeakable mistreatment, never gave up hope. Fifty-seven years later he returned to revisit the place where he should have died and where he had buried his closest friend. From that emotional visit sprung this stunning memoir. Long Way Back to the River Kwai is a simply told but searing memoir of World War II a testimonial to one man s indomitable will to live that will take its place beside the Diary of Ann Frank, Bridge over the River Kwai, and Edith s Story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IDuCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tutira;: The story of a New Zealand sheep station","description":"This pioneering 1921 book focuses on the environmental impact of introduced species on New Zealand's native flora and fauna.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l35aVYXpH8sC&dq=Tutira%3B:+The+story+of+a+New+Zealand+sheep+station&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The chessmen of Mars","description":"Impetuous and headstrong is Tara, Princess of Helium and daughter of John Carter. Tara meets Prince Gahan of Gathol, and is initially unimpressed, viewing him as something of a popinjay. Later she takes her flier into a storm and loses control of the craft, and the storm carries her to an unfamiliar region of Barsoom. After landing and fleeing from a pack of ferocious Banths (Martian lions), she is captured by the horrific Kaldanes, who resemble large heads with small, crab-like legs. The Kaldanes have bred a symbiotic race of headless human-like creatures called Rykors, which they can attach themselves to and ride like a horse. While imprisoned, Tara manages to win over one of the Kaldanes, Ghek, with her lovely singing voice. Fifth of his Barsoom series. Burroughs began writing it in January, 1921, and the finished story was first published in Argosy All-Story Weekly as a six-part serial in the issues for February 18 and 25 and March 4, 11, 18 and 25, 1922. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in November 1922. \\"A daughter,\\" he replied, \\"only a little younger than Carthoris, and, barring one, the fairest thing that ever breathed the thin air of dying Mars. Only Dejah Thoris, her mother, could be more beautiful than Tara of Helium.\\" For a moment he fingered the chessmen idly. \\"We have a game on Mars similar to chess,\\" he said, \\"very similar. And there is a race there that plays it grimly with men and naked swords. We call the game jetan. It is played on a board like yours, except that there are a hundred squares and we use twenty pieces on each side. I never see it played without thinking of Tara of Helium and what befell her among the chessmen of Barsoom. Would you like to hear her story?\\" I said that I would and so he told it to me, and now I shall try to re-tell it for you as nearly in the words of The Warlord of Mars as I can recall them, but in the third person. If there be inconsistencies and errors, let the blame fall not upon John Carter, but rather upon my faulty memory, where it belongs.

In the memoir Mary Karr calls  a page-turner,  Helene Stapinski ingeniously weaves the checkered history of her hometown of Jersey City a place known for its political corruption and industrial blight with the tales that have swirled around her relatives for decades. Navigating a childhood of toxic waste and tough love, Stapinski tells an extraordinary tale at once heartbreaking and hysterically funny.

Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times  It s a brilliant book, a darling book.

James Oliver 'Jim' Curwood was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. He was born on 12th June, 1878, in Owosso, Michigan, USA. In 1900, Curwood sold his first story while working for the Detroit News-Tribune, and after this, his career in writing was made. By 1909 he had saved enough money to travel to the Canadian northwest, a trip that provided the inspiration for his wilderness adventure stories. The success of his novels afforded him the opportunity to return to the Yukon and Alaska for several months each year - allowing Curwood to write more than thirty such books. Curwood's adventure writing followed in the tradition of Jack London. Like London, Curwood set many of his works in the wilds of the Great Northwest and often used animals as lead characters (Kazan, Baree; Son of Kazan, The Grizzly King and Nomads of the North). Many of Curwood's adventure novels also feature romance as primary or secondary plot consideration. This approach gave his work broad commercial appeal and helped drive his appearance on several best-seller lists in the early 1920s. His most successful work was his 1920 novel, The River's End. The book sold more than 100,000 copies and was the fourth best-selling title of the year in the United States, according to Publisher's Weekly. He contributed to various literary and popular magazines throughout his career, and his bibliography includes more than 200 such articles, short stories and serializations. The change in his attitude toward wildlife can be best expressed by a quote he gave in The Grizzly King: that 'The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let live.' Despite this change in attitude, Curwood did not have an ultimately fruitful relationship with nature. In 1927, while on a fishing trip in Florida, Curwood was bitten on the thigh by what was believed to have been a spider and he had an immediate allergic reaction. Health problems related to the bite escalated over the next few months as an infection set in. He died soon after in his nearby home on Williams Street, on 13th August 1927. He was aged just forty-nine, and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery (Owosso), in a family plot. Curwood's legacy lives on however, and his home of Curwood Castle is now a museum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Hp9CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Veil of Night (Vampire: The Dark Ages)","description":"Dark Ages: Vampire takes you to the nights before the Camarilla, when kine truly had reason to be afraid of the dark.

From the Mod revolution and the British Invasion of the 1960s, through the psychedelic era of the 1970s, and into the exuberance and excesses of stadium rock in the 1980s, Kenney Jones helped to build rock and roll as we know it. He was the beat behind three of the world's most enduring and significant bands. He wasn't just in the right place at the right time. Along with Keith Moon, John Bonham, and Charlie Watts, Jones is regarded as one of the greatest drummers of all time, sought after by a wide variety of the best-known and best-selling artists to bring his unique skill into the studio for the recording of classic albums and songs including, of course, the Rolling Stones's \\"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It).\\" And Jones is no shallow rock star. He may play polo with royalty from across the globe now, but this is the story of a ragamuffin from the East End of London, a boy who watched his bandmates, friends since his teens, die early, combated dyslexia to find a medium in which he could uniquely excel, and later found a way through the wilderness years when the good times seemed to have gone and he had little to fall back on.

The Power of the Press is a pioneering look at the birth of political journalism. Before the American Revolution, Thomas Leonard notes, the press in the colonies was a timid enterprise, poorly protected by law and shy of government. Newspapers helped make the Revolution, but they were not fully aware of the way they could fit into a democracy. It was only in the nineteenth century that journalists learned to tell the stories and supply the pictures that made politics a national preoccupation. Leonard traces the rise of political reporting through some fascinating corridors of American history: the exposes of the Revolutionary era, the \\"unfeeling accuracy\\" of Congressional reporting, the role of the New York Times and Harper's Weekly in attacking New York City's infamous Tweed Ring, and the emergence of \\"muckraking\\" at the beginning of our century. The increasing power of the press in the political arena has been a double-edged sword, Leonard argues. He shows that while political reporting nurtured the broad interest in politics that made democracy possible, this journalism became a threat to political participation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F2e_2gdoz5AC&dq=Power+Press:+Its+Impact+on+America+and+What+You+Can+Do+About+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diary of a Scullery Maid","description":"Although the story opens and closes in present-day Spain, the real beginnings are set in the early 1900s when, in Africa, the well-equipped army of the British Empire was being humbled by a few Boer farmers whose only uniform was a slouch hat and a bandolier over everyday work clothes. In England, with the wealth of the aristocracy in decline, Lord and Lady Blanchford-Carter decided to augment their dwindling finances by transforming part of their stately mansion into a high-class brothel for the upper echelons of society. Into this strange household came the young and innocent Helen Sarsfield to commence employment as a scullery maid. In Ireland, Helen's twin brother enlisted in the Connaught Rangers, and would soon depart for Africa, leaving behind his sweetheart in an Ireland rife with talks of insurrection; a place where James Connolly was reminding people that England's difficulty was Ireland's opportunity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3AbVk2QbeYC&dq=The+Diary+of+a+Scullery+Maid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One-Room School: Teaching in 1930s Western Oklahoma (Western Frontier Library)","description":"Stephens, the daughter of the schoolteacher, details the experiences and challenges faced by Helen Hussman Morris as a teacher in rural Oklahoma during the Depression era.

Robert Jacks. \\"I've also heard some duds. Some have been so extemporaneous they sounded as if the preacher hadn't prepared anything. Some have been such wondrously crafted literary pieces they sounded as if the preacher wanted to sound wondrously crafted and literary. Some have sounded as though the preacher were giving a lecture or reading a term paper. That's because the preacher had written a lecture or term paper. And some have captured the attention and the imagination and set the spark to ignite faith in the hearer. That's because they were written to be listened to, and to appeal to the sense-world of the hearers.\\" Drawing on nearly thirty years of experience in critiquing sermon delivery, Jacks here offers a practical, hands-on approach to writing sermons that consider listeners first. Jacks gives samples and examples of writing that effectively captures and holds an audience's attention, and he offers practical tips and suggestions intended to help each of us find a preaching style and voice of our own. He also shows how to translate the jargon of theological textbooks into everyday language, suggests methods for rewriting sermons to avoid some of the pomposity of sermonic proclamation, and demonstrates ways to retell biblical narratives in fresh and imaginative ways. Just Say the Word! Writing for the Ear is a valuable resource that will help pastors and lay leaders communicate as effectively as possible the faith that is ours to share.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HWc0S0251lMC&dq=Just+Say+the+Word!:+Writing+for+the+Ear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What do you know about dolphins (National Geographic windows on literacy)","description":"This guided reader is part of a non-fiction reading scheme that integrates science and social studies content with literacy development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4D_SAQAACAAJ&dq=What+do+you+know+about+dolphins+(National+Geographic+windows+on+literacy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn to Program Visual Basic Objects","description":"A programmer's complete guide to Visual Basic .NET.

First published in 1531, this illustrated book was a collection of emblems, each consisting of a motto or proverb, a typically enigmatic illustration, and a short explanation. Most of the emblems had symbolic and moral applications. Scholars depended on Alciati's book to interpret contemporary art and literature, while writers and artists turned to it to invest their work with an understood didactic sense. This new edition of the Emblematum Liber includes the original Latin texts, highly readable English translations, and the illustrations belonging to each of the 212 emblems. The editor's introduction explains both the importance and the cultural contexts of Alciati's book, as well as its innumerable artistic applications. For instance, close study of the emblems reveals--to cite only two examples--why statues of lions are traditionally placed before government buildings, and what underlying political message was conveyed by innumerable equestrian portraits during the Baroque era. The collection includes as an appendix the formerly suppressed emblem, \\"Adversus Naturam Peccantes,\\" accompanied by a translation of the learned commentary applied to it by Johann Thuilius in 1612. An extensive bibliography points the student to scholarly research specifically dealing with artistic applications of Alciati's emblems. Altogether, this new edition of Alciati's seminal work is an essential tool for modern students of the liberal arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_nKuBAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Book+of+Emblems:+The+Emblematum+Liber+in+Latin+and+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night the Bear Ate Goombaw","description":"A consummate American humorist takes on a new range of topics, including metaphysics, the benefits of a runny nose, and how to successfully avoid distasteful chores","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Sat_RRzsZIC&dq=The+Night+the+Bear+Ate+Goombaw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freedom from Headache","description":"Headache Free will help a person find the root cause of their chronic pain, and eliminate toxins and triggers.

How and why did these farflung empires form, persist, and finally fall? David Abernethy addresses these questions in this magisterial survey of the rise and decline of European overseas empires. Abernethy identifies broad patterns across time and space, interweaving them with fascinating details of cross-cultural encounters. He argues that relatively autonomous profit-making, religious, and governmental institutions enabled west European countries to launch triple assaults on other societies. Indigenous people also played a role in their eventual subjugation by inviting Europeans to intervene in their power struggles. Abernethy finds that imperial decline was often the unanticipated result of wars among major powers. Postwar crises over colonies' unmet expectations empowered movements that eventually took territories as diverse as the thirteen British North American colonies, Spain's South American possessions, India, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and the Gold Coast to independence. In advancing a theory of imperialism that includes European and non-European actors, and in analyzing economic, social, and cultural as well as political dimensions of empire, Abernethy helps account for Europe's long occupation of global center stage. He also sheds light on key features of today's postcolonial world and the legacies of empire, concluding with an insightful approach to the moral evaluation of colonialism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ennqNS1EOuMC&dq=The+Dynamics+of+Global+Dominance:+European+Overseas+Empires,+1415-1980&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clanbook: Giovanni","description":"Bury Yourself in This Foul Book...

(Penguin Classics)","description":"The first of Cather s renowned prairie novels, O Pioneers! established a new voice in American literature turning the stories of ordinary Midwesterners and immigrants into authentic literary characters. O Pioneers! was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself. At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, O Pioneers! is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Cowan also addresses the ever-present tensions between tourist development and the needs and demands of residents in urban communities.

In essence the efficient clearing and settlement operation is managing risk, not because it is a direct part of the process but more because it is a bi-product. The routine procedures relate to reconciliation and record keeping. If these are performed efficiently and accurately it will result in accurate records of activity and profit and loss. The settlement process is a key element in identifying and correcting errors made by dealers and traders. Failure to identify the error or act promptly will result in potentially serious financial loss, as well as worrying audit and the regulators. In addition to these concerns the financial service sector is also undergoing a massive rationalization of the structure of clearing and settlement and seeking the twin goals of automation and shortening settlement cycles. The challenge for operations managers is considerable: manage costs, eradicate inefficiencies, create an environment to be competitive, and implement the procedures to meet future changes that will occur. In this book the author looks at some of the different roles, the processes and procedures, and the key issues, in order to help those in operations meet the challenge. The definitive series of professional references for those finance professionals concerned with \\"Back office\\" or operations management unique to this industry.Presents concise references on the essential management functions such as technology, client services, and risk management for financial operations management professionals.A comprehensive resource from a leading financial management consultant for global banks and institutions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qpqnBki-aXoC&dq=Clearing,+Settlement+and+Custody+(Securities+Institute+Operations+Management)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flora's Dictionary: The Victorian Language of Herbs and Flowers","description":"Do you know what you're saying when you give the gift of flowers or plants?

The prize was seven months of ?unparalleled solitude? as the caretaker of a ninety-two-acre backcountry homestead along the Rogue National Wild and Scenic River in southwestern Oregon. Young, recently divorced, and humbled by the prospect of so much time alone, he left behind his job as a college English teacher in Indiana and headed west for a remote but comfortable cabin in the rugged Klamath Mountains. ? Well aware of what could go wrong living two hours from town with no electricity and no neighbors, Edwards was surprised by what could go right. In prose that is by turns lyrical, introspective, and funny, Breaking into the Backcountry is the story of what he discovered: that alone, in a wild place, each day is a challenge and a gift. Whether chronicling the pleasures of a day-long fishing trip, his first encounter with a black bear, a lightning storm and the threat of fire, the beauty of a?steelhead, the attacks of 9/11, or a silence so profound that a black-tailed deer chewing grass outside his window could wake him from sleep, Edwards?s careful evocation of the river canyon and its effect on him testifies to the enduring power of wilderness to transform a life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UWQqDwAAQBAJ&dq=Into+the+Back+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Letter to the Hebrews (Daily Study Bible (Westminster Hardcover))","description":"For more than fifty years and for millions of readers around the world, the New Daily Study Bible commentaries have been the ideal help for both devotional and serious Bible study.

While there has been a great deal of scholarly attention on superheroes, very little has been done to understand supervillains. This is the first academic work to provide a comprehensive study of this villain, illustrating why the Joker appears so relevant to audiences today. Batman s foe has cropped up in thousands of comics, numerous animated series, and three major blockbuster feature films since 1966. Actually, the Joker debuted in DC comics Batman 1 (1940) as the typical gangster, but the character evolved steadily into one of the most ominous in the history of sequential art. Batman and the Joker almost seemed to define each other as opposites, hero and nemesis, in a kind of psychological duality. Scholars from a wide array of disciplines look at the Joker through the lens of feature films, video games, comics, politics, magic and mysticism, psychology, animation, television, performance studies, and philosophy. As the first volume that examines the Joker as complex cultural and cross-media phenomenon, this collection adds to our understanding of the role comic book and cinematic villains play in the world and the ways various media affect their interpretation. Connecting the Clown Prince of Crime to bodies of thought as divergent as Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche, contributors demonstrate the frightening ways in which we get the monsters we need.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XwwbBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of his uncle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VLlvzgEACAAJ&dq=Death+of+his+uncle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jay's Treaty,: A study in commerce and diplomacy,","description":"This file includes: i) a petition to the Supreme Court of the U.S., from Mrs. P.L.

In addition to his long public service as a diplomat, Irving was amazingly prolific: His collected works fill forty volumes that encompass essays, history, travel writings, and multi-volume biographies of Columbus and Washington. But it is Irving's mastery of suspense, characterization, tempo, and irony that transforms his fiction into virtuoso performances, earning him his reputation as the father of the American short story. Charles Neider has gathered all sixty-one of Irving's tales, originally scattered throughout his many collections of nonfiction essays and sketches, into one magnificent volume. Together, they reveal his wide range: besides the expected classics like \\"Rip Van Winkle,\\" \\"The Spectre Bridegroom,\\" \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" and \\"The Devil and Tom Walker,\\" his fiction embraces realistic tales, ghost stories, parodies, legends, fables, and satires.

Aldisert, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge, a distinguished member of the Greatest Generation who s still active as a judge on the second highest court in the land, just a notch below the U.S. Supreme Court. There is a huge sweep in these pages. Born in 1919, the author takes the reader from his early childhood to 1968, when he first put on robes as a U.S. Circuit Judge. You ll find no stodgy writing here, nary a  whereas  and  aforesaid,  but it s what the author says in his prefacea great-grandfather sitting back with the young ones and reminiscing how it was to grow up before dial telephones and when the first radio was a crystal set powered with two batteries and you listened with a set of earphones. But it s more than family memoirs; there s a lot of history set in the Twenties, and Thirties, and most of the time it wasn t to the tune of  Happy Days are Here Again.  Judge Aldisert grew up as the son of an Italian immigrant in a Pennsylvania steel mill and coal mining town, remembers the Twenties when men worked 12-hour shifts, except every other Sunday when it was a 24-hour shift, came face to face with the Great Depression, the spread of world conflict during his 1937-1941 college years, and describes World War II service as Marine Corps officer in the Pacific. He gives an insider s view of a lawyer who tried both civil and criminal cases, of life as a Pittsburgh trial court judge, and of the rocky road to nomination by President Lyndon B. Johnson and confirmation by the U.S. Senate in 1968.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jlexxD94fE8C&dq=Road+to+the+Robes:+A+Federal+Judge+Recollects+Young+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Civil War, 1861-1865,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FbQTAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Masters of Flash (WITH CD-ROM)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VJ2KMQAACAAJ&dq=New+Masters+of+Flash+(WITH+CD-ROM)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ecumenical Movement: An Anthology of Keytexts and Voices","description":"Included in this collection of documents from the twentieth-century ecumenical movement are passages from texts produced by assemblies, conferences, and studies of the World Council of Churches and similar bodies, covering three areas of historical concern within modern ecumenism: faith and order, life and work, and mission and evangelism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MJKuXYlO5YUC&dq=Ecumenical+Movement:+An+Anthology+of+Keytexts+and+Voices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Study, 6th Edition","description":"Motor Learning and Performance, Sixth Edition, constructs a conceptual model of factors that influence motor performance, outlines how motor skills are acquired and retained with practice, and shows how to apply those concepts to a variety of real-world settings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iFSwDwAAQBAJ&dq=How+to+Study,+6th+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WnJJzQEACAAJ&dq=Hymns+of+the+Church+of+Jesus+Christ+of+Latter-day+Saints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Server+ Certification Training Kit (Pro Technical Refere)","description":"PART OF THE NEW JONES & BARTLETT LEARNING INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY & ASSURANCE SERIES More than 90 percent of individuals, students, educators, businesses, organizations, and governments use Microsoft Windows, which has experienced frequent attacks against its well-publicized vulnerabilities.

Holger Carlsen is a rational man of science. A Danish engineer working with the Resistance to defeat the Nazis, he is wounded during an engagement with the enemy and awakens in an unfamiliar parallel universe where the forces of Law are locked in eternal combat with the forces of Chaos.

Teeth takes readers on a disturbing journey into America's silent epidemic of oral disease, exposing the hidden connections between tooth decay and stunted job prospects, low educational achievement, social mobility, and the troubling state of our public health. Otto's subjects include the pioneering dentist who made Shirley Temple and Judy Garland's teeth sparkle on the silver screen and helped create the all-American image of \\"pearly whites\\"; Deamonte Driver, the young Maryland boy whose tragic death from an abscessed tooth sparked congressional hearings; and a marketing guru who offers advice to dentists on how to push new and expensive treatments and how to keep Medicaid patients at bay. In one of its most disturbing findings, Teeth reveals that toothaches are not an occasional inconvenience, but rather a chronic reality for millions of people, including disproportionate numbers of the elderly and people of color. Many people, Otto reveals, resort to prayer to counteract the uniquely devastating effects of dental pain. Otto also goes back in time to understand the roots of our predicament in the history of dentistry, showing how it became separated from mainstream medicine, despite a century of growing evidence that oral health and general bodily health are closely related. Muckraking and paradigm-shifting, Teeth exposes for the first time the extent and meaning of our oral health crisis. It joins the small shelf of books that change the way we view society and ourselves and will spark an urgent conversation about why our teeth matter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0g2DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden Rendezvous","description":"A timeless classic of modern-day piracy from the acclaimed master of action and suspense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WGyVzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Golden+Rendezvous&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teen People: Celebrity Style Guide","description":"Helps teens express themselves through fashion by getting them in touch with their inner fashionista, giving them the lowdown on body shapes and how celebrities dress to flatter them, revealing the ten commandments of shopping, and showing them how to look like a million without spending it.

Clinicians, backed by a grassroots movement of patients and therapists, find child sexual abuse to be the primary cause of the illness, while critics accuse the \\"MPD\\" community of fostering false memories of childhood trauma. Here the distinguished philosopher Ian Hacking uses the MPD epidemic and its links with the contemporary concept of child abuse to scrutinize today's moral and political climate, especially our power struggles about memory and our efforts to cope with psychological injuries. What is it like to suffer from multiple personality? Most diagnosed patients are women: why does gender matter? How does defining an illness affect the behavior of those who suffer from it? And, more generally, how do systems of knowledge about kinds of people interact with the people who are known about? Answering these and similar questions, Hacking explores the development of the modern multiple personality movement. He then turns to a fascinating series of historical vignettes about an earlier wave of multiples, people who were diagnosed as new ways of thinking about memory emerged, particularly in France, toward the end of the nineteenth century. Fervently occupied with the study of hypnotism, hysteria, sleepwalking, and fugue, scientists of this period aimed to take the soul away from the religious sphere. What better way to do this than to make memory a surrogate for the soul and then subject it to empirical investigation? Made possible by these nineteenth-century developments, the current outbreak of dissociative disorders is embedded in new political settings. Rewriting the Soul concludes with a powerful analysis linking historical and contemporary material in a fresh contribution to the archaeology of knowledge. As Foucault once identified a politics that centers on the body and another that classifies and organizes the human population, Hacking has now provided a masterful description of the politics of memory : the scientizing of the soul and the wounds it can receive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T8skNjRNFZMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasures of the one-room school, Delaware County, New York","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8lBBHQAACAAJ&dq=Treasures+of+the+one-room+school,+Delaware+County,+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Field Guide to the Birds of Japan","description":"A brand new, comprehensive and fully illustrated field guide to the birds of Japan, covering all 738 species and subspecies with superb color plates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pxN2EAAAQBAJ&dq=Field+Guide+to+the+Birds+of+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disaster 1906;: The San Francisco earthquake and fire, (Milestones in history)","description":"In 1906 San Francisco suffered the worst damage ever inflicted on an American city.

By bringing to light many unresearched dimensions of the twelfth-century Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat during its modern history, the study argues for a conceptual, connected history that unfolded within the transcultural interstices of European and Asian projects. With more than 1,400 black-and-white and colour illustrations of historic photographs, architectural plans and samples of public media, the monograph discusses the multiple lives of Angkor Wat over a 150-year-long period from the 1860s to the 2010s. Volume 1 (Angkor in France) reconceptualises the Orientalist, French-colonial  discovery  of the temple in the nineteenth century and brings to light the manifold strategies at play in its physical representations as plaster cast substitutes in museums and as hybrid pavilions in universal and colonial exhibitions in Marseille and Paris from 1867 to 1937. Volume 2 (Angkor in Cambodia) covers, for the first time in this depth, the various on-site restoration efforts inside the  Archaeological Park of Angkor  from 1907 until 1970, and the temple s gradual canonisation as a symbol of national identity during Cambodia s troublesome decolonisation (195389), from independence to Khmer Rouge terror and Vietnamese occupation, and, finally, as a global icon of UNESCO World Heritage since 1992 until today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wjrEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Love","description":"This cozy and cuddly Classic Board Book celebrates all the wonderful things about babies!

Laws are then passed making genetic tests mandatory, and anyone displaying the gene is sent to a treatment facility. Would the laws be constitutional? In this illuminating history, legal scholar David L. Faigman reveals the tension between the conservative nature of the law and the swift evolution of scientific knowledge. The Supreme Court works by precedent, embedding the science of an earlier time into our laws. In the nineteenth century, biology helped settle the \\"race question\\" in the famous Dred Scott case; not until a century later would cutting-edge sociological data end segregation with Brown v. Board of Education. In 1973 Roe v. Wade set a standard for the viability of a fetus that modern medicine could render obsolete. And how does the Fourth Amendment apply in a world filled with high-tech surveillance devices? To ensure our liberties, Faigman argues, the Court must embrace science, turning to the lab as well as to precedent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago","description":"Yuri Zhivago, doctor and poet, lives and loves during the first three decades of 20th-century Russia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3TtAJXfKttIC&dq=Doctor+Zhivago&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea,","description":"This book is a fascinating and detailed chronicle of over two years spent in the American merchant service during the early 1800s.

How can we explain and lecture effectively? How can we help students master content? How can we make learning more real and lasting? In this revised and greatly expanded 2nd edition of Inspiring Active Learning, educators Merrill Harmin and Melanie Toth provide answers to our fundamental teaching questions and show us how to transform our classrooms into communities of active, responsible learners. The authors present an array of research-based, teacher-tested strategies for managing our everyday responsibilities--from beginning a class to grading homework, from instructing large groups to promoting diligent seatwork, from motivating slackers to handling disrupters.

Interviewing black and white working-class men who, because they are not college graduates, have limited access to high-paying jobs and other social benefits, she constructs a revealing portrait of how they see themselves and the rest of society. Morality is at the center of these workers' worlds. They find their identity and self-worth in their ability to discipline themselves and conduct responsible but caring lives. These moral standards function as an alternative to economic definitions of success, offering them a way to maintain dignity in an out-of-reach American dreamland. But these standards also enable them to draw class boundaries toward the poor and, to a lesser extent, the upper half. Workers also draw rigid racial boundaries, with white workers placing emphasis on the \\"disciplined self\\" and blacks on the \\"caring self.\\" Whites thereby often construe blacks as morally inferior because they are lazy, while blacks depict whites as domineering, uncaring, and overly disciplined. This book also opens up a wider perspective by examining American workers in comparison with French workers, who take the poor as \\"part of us\\" and are far less critical of blacks than they are of upper-middle-class people and immigrants. By singling out different \\"moral offenders\\" in the two societies, workers reveal contrasting definitions of \\"cultural membership\\" that help us understand and challenge the forms of inequality found in both societies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ehXs95d-BU4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Live & Work in the USA and Canada (Living & Working Abroad Guides)","description":"There's a big difference between being alive and knowing how to truly live.

Robertson shows how modern election campaigning was born. Robertson discusses early political cartoons and electioneering speeches as he examines the role of each nation s press in assimilating masses of new voters into the political system. Even a decade after the American Revolution, the authors shows, British and American political culture had much in common. On both sides of the Atlantic, electioneering in the 1790s was confined mostly to male elites, and published speeches shared a characteristically Neoclassical rhetoric. As voting rights were expanded, however, politicians sought a more effective medium and style for communicating with less-educated audiences. Comparing changes in the modes of in the two countries, Robertson reconstructs the transformation of campaign rhetoric into forms that incorporated the oral culture of the stump speech as well as elite print culture. By the end of the nineteenth century, the press had become the primary medium for initiating, persuading, and sustaining loyal partisan audiences. In Britain and America, millions of men participated in a democratic political culture that spoke their language, played to their prejudices, and courted their approval. Today s readers concerned with broadening political discourse to reach a more diverse audience will find rich and intriguing parallels in Robertson s account.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HN5hzTRJAooC&dq=The+Language+Of+Democracy:+Political+Rhetoric+In+The+United+States+And+Britain,+1790-1900&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Life Story: The Autobiography of a Turkish Businessman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ptRzmQEACAAJ&dq=My+Life+Story:+The+Autobiography+of+a+Turkish+Businessman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mahdi","description":"The emergence of Radical Islamists should be no surprise to students of Scripture.

Legend has it that somewhere in the middle of the Great Sand Sea, his army was overwhelmed by a sandstorm and destroyed. Fifty thousand men were lost. A mutilated corpse washes up on the banks of the Nile. An antiques dealer is murdered. An eminent British archaeologist is found dead at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara. At first, the incidents appear unconnected. Inspector Yusuf Khalifa of the Luxor police is suspicious, however. And so too is the archaeologist's daughter, Tara Mullray.

For the wider worlds of government, intelligence and the media it triggered a political earthquake. David Kelly, a weapons inspector in Iraq, was at the centre of the allegations that 10 Downing Street, seeking to justify the imminent war in Iraq to an unconvinced public, had exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. Lord Hutton's inquiry into the circumstances of Kelly's death became the most compelling piece of political theatre of modern times, as witnesses from the highest reaches of government, the Civil Service, the intelligence services and the BBC gave their versions of events, exposing the inner workings of their hitherto secret worlds. And the conclusions of his Report, published in January 2004, took most pundits by surprise. The Guardian's coverage of the Hutton inquiry was widely regarded as the best informed and most comprehensive of any newspaper, with its top reporters and analysts providing unrivalled reporting. In this specially commissioned book they give a comprehensive account of the inquiry, describing the evidence, analysing the ramifications and assessing the lasting effect it will have on the often stormy relationship between the government and the media.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V2NnAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Hutton+Inquiry+and+Its+Impact&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unnaturally","description":"The food discussion in America can be quite pessimistic. With high obesity rates, diabetes, climate change, chemical use, water contamination, and farm animal abuse, it would seem that there wasn't very much room for a positive perspective. The fear that there just isn't enough food has expanded to new areas of concern about water availability, rising health care costs, and dying bees. In Unnaturally Delicious, Lusk makes room for optimism by writing the story of the changing food system, suggesting that technology and agriculture can work together in a healthy and innovative way to help solve the world's largest food issues and improve the farming system as we know it. This is the story of the innovators and innovations shaping the future of food. You ll meet an ex-farmer entrepreneur whose software is now being used all over the world to help farmers increase yields and reduce nutrient runoff and egg producers who ve created new hen housing systems that improve animal welfare at an affordable price. There are scientists growing meat in the lab. Without the cow. College students are coaxing bacteria to signal food quality and fight obesity. Nutrient enhanced rice and sweet potatoes are aiming to solve malnutrition in the developing world. Geneticists are creating new wheat varieties that allow farmers sustainably grow more with less. And, we ll learn how to get fresh, tasty, 3D printed food at the touch of a button, perhaps even delivered to us by a robotic chef. Innovation is the American way. Thomas Jefferson, George Washington Carver, and John Harvey Kellogg were food and agricultural entrepreneurs. Their delicious innovations led to new healthy, tasty, convenient, and environmentally friendly food. The creations were unnaturally delicious. Unnatural because the foods and practices they fashioned were man-made solutions to natural and man-made problems. Now the world is filled with new challenges changing the way we think about food. Who are the scientists, entrepreneurs, and progressive farmers who meet these challenges and search for solutions?

They are \\"breakthrough\\" service providers, firms that changed the rules of the game in their respective industries by consistently meeting or exceeding customer needs and expectations. To find out how these companies do it, service management experts James Heskett, Earl Sasser, and Christopher Hart put the question to the chief executive officers of fifteen of America's leading service firms attending a workshop at the Harvard Business School. Breakthrough leaders, they discovered, think very differently about their businesses than do their competitors, in distinct and well-defined ways. Now, in Service Breakthroughs, based upon five years of exhaustive research in fourteen service industries, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show exactly what enables one or two companies in each industry to constantly set new standards for quality and value that force competitors to adapt or fail. At the heart of breakthrough performance, the authors contend, is a sometimes intuitive but thorough understanding of the \\"self-reinforcing service cycle\\" that replaces traditional management of \\"trade-offs.\\" The \\"cycle\\" is a paradigm derived from the research results suggesting direct links between heightened customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, augmented sales and profit, improved quality and productivity, greater service value per unit of cost, improved satisfaction of service providers, increased employee retention, and further heightened customer satisfaction. With detailed examples and dramatic case studies of Mark Twain Bancshares, American Airlines, Florida Power & Light, Federal Express, McDonald's and many other companies, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show how this self-reinforcing cycle of behavior differentiates breakthrough leaders from their \\"merely good\\" competitors. The authors describe how breakthrough managers develop counterintuitive, even contrarian, strategic service visions. These companies define their \\"service concept\\" in terms of results achieved for customers rather than services performed. They target market segments by focusing on psychographics -- how customers think and behave -- instead of demographics. And instead of viewing a service delivery system as a facility where the service is producted and sold, breakthrough firms see it as an opportunity to enhance the quality of the service. These profound differences in thought and action have brought spectacular results. For managers who wish to set the pace in their service industries, Service Breakthroughs will be essential reading.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Q7YgJpQ54kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God and the State","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I80zAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Letters of James and Peter (Daily Study Bible (Westminster Hardcover))","description":"Here, as in the other titles in this series, is Dr. Barclay's own translation of the day's study together with his enlightening commentary.

When his wife Linda wakes up to find Davy's hands squeezed around her neck, it takes all of her strength to get away. But Davy is more than shellshocked from the war. He's haunted by events of twelve years before, when his mother was murdered by his father, Bayard, who is serving life in prison and had always insisted that he was not the one who killed his wife. Linda hopes that if Davy's father could be proved innocent, it might clear the conscience of her young, angry war hero husband, saving her marriage and herself. She suggests to Davy that they seek out Ellery Queen, a New York writer whom she remembers successfully solved a previous Wrightsville mystery. For Queen, the case is a long shot: with his only witnesses people closely connected to the victim, and Queen's only clue Bayard Fox's insistence of innocence, the clearest path leads back to the man already serving a life sentence. Determined to get to the truth of the matter, Queen returns to the house where the murder took place, a house preserved down to the smallest detail precisely as it had been when the tragedy struck. And here he finds the clues that blast the case wide open. From his first appearance in print in 1929, Ellery Queen became one of America s most famous and beloved fictional detectives. Over the course of nearly half a century, Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee, the duo writing team known as Ellery Queen, won the prestigious Edgar Award multiple times, and their contributions to the mystery genre were recognized with a Grand Master Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Mystery Writers of America. Their fair-play mysteries won over fans due to their intricate puzzles that challenged the reader to solve the mystery alongside the brilliant detective. Queen s stories were among the first to dominate the earliest days of radio, film, and television. Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine, which the writers founded and edited, became the world s most influential and acclaimed crime fiction magazine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0jI4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Copycats","description":"The editor and publisher of Foreign Policy magazine provides a thought-provoking look at how smugglers and traffickers, backed by powerful, well-financed networks, have affected the global economy, examining the interconnections among a variety of such illegal enterprises and their operations and emphasizing the need to stop them.

The author was uncommonly careful in his explanations. I'd recommend this book to anyone writing scientific application codes.\\" -Peter S. Pacheco, University of San Francisco \\"This text provides a useful overview of an area that is currently not addressed in any book. The presentation of parallel I/O issues across all levels of abstraction is this book's greatest strength.\\" -Alan Sussman, University of Maryland Scientific and technical programmers can no longer afford to treat I/O as an afterthought. The speed, memory size, and disk capacity of parallel computers continue to grow rapidly, but the rate at which disk drives can read and write data is improving far less quickly. As a result, the performance of carefully tuned parallel programs can slow dramatically when they read or write files-and the problem is likely to get far worse. Parallel input and output techniques can help solve this problem by creating multiple data paths between memory and disks. However, simply adding disk drives to an I/O system without considering the overall software design will not significantly improve performance. To reap the full benefits of a parallel I/O system, application programmers must understand how parallel I/O systems work and where the performance pitfalls lie. Parallel I/O for High Performance Computing directly addresses this critical need by examining parallel I/O from the bottom up. This important new book is recommended to anyone writing scientific application codes as the best single source on I/O techniques and to computer scientists as a solid up-to-date introduction to parallel I/O research. Features: An overview of key I/O issues at all levels of abstraction-including hardware, through the OS and file systems, up to very high-level scientific libraries. Describes the important features of MPI-IO, netCDF, and HDF-5 and presents numerous examples illustrating how to use each of these I/O interfaces. Addresses the basic question of how to read and write data efficiently in HPC applications. An explanation of various layers of storage - and techniques for using disks (and sometimes tapes) effectively in HPC applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iLj516DOIKkC&dq=Parallel+I/O+for+High+Performance+Computing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malick Sidibe","description":"Sidibe's genre pictures, group portraits, images of couples in love, of sexy young men & women express pure joy of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OUXrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Malick+Sidibe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary","description":"A collection of barbed definitions by one of America's most caustic humorists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9zEjAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+devil%27s+dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As Nomadism Ends: The Israeli Bedouin Of The Negev","description":"As pastoral nomads become settled, they face social, spatial, and ecological change in the shift from herding to farming, toward integration into the market economy.

This unleashing of divine power and its militaristic imagery has long caught the attention of scholars as starkly nationalistic. Thomas B. Dozeman furthers this study by addressing the theological problem of divine power in the Exodus story and, by extension, the Judeo-Christian attempt to deify nationalism by calling its wars holy. He interprets Exodus as liturgy, the Day of Yahweh, celebrating God's defeat of Pharaoh and the ultimate ascendancy of Israelite authority. This liturgy, though, did not remain static, but changed as the national experience of exile changed the practice of Israelite worship. An isolated event evolved into an extended account of salvation history, in which the life of faith becomes a wilderness march to the promised land. Dozeman traces how revisionary embellishments in the plot structure and characters of the Exodus story reflected the new understanding of divine power. By combining literary and historical interpretation this study offers the first serious inquiry into the idea of divine power, and makes a major contribution to resurgent research on the Pentateuch as a whole. No scholar concerned with biblical historiography and its justification of holy wars can afford to ignore this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LSDoCwAAQBAJ&dq=God+at+War:+A+Study+of+Power+in+the+Exodus+Tradition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touching the Fire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nk0LAzyG3noC&dq=Touching+the+Fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Painter of Birds","description":"The setting of this extraordinary novel is an old farmhouse in Portugal - a house far enough from the Atlantic not to hear the breaking waves during a storm but near enough for the walls to be corroded by the salt in the air. With most members of her large family having left the hardship of life in this landscape of sand and stone for jobs in faraway places, a young woman struggles to piece together her past from the many and differing stories she is told. Left behind by a free-spirited, feckless father, a seducer with a talent for drawing, she is raised by her uncle who has married her mother. The only memories of her father's one brief visit are the echoes of his footsteps on the stairs leading to her room. The only signs of him are letters from the widest reaches of the world- letters accompanied by brilliantly coloured drawings of exotic birds: the cuckoo from India, the ibis from Mozambique, the goose from Labrador, the hummingbird from the West Indies. The daughter longs for her father and, as she grows up, she is determined to find him and uncover the truth. Beautifully written and imagined, this strikingly lyrical novel evokes the atmosphere of a rural community in a changing world and explores the timeless themes of family, independence, and the often painful experience of emigration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iZ3qngEACAAJ&dq=The+Painter+of+Birds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Audio Scripts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e5XvygEACAAJ&dq=Doctor+Who:+The+Audio+Scripts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz and Friends Stickers (Dover Little Activity Books Stickers)","description":"Relive the adventures of Dorothy and her friends in the land of Oz with this colorful sticker collection.

He defines curriculum integration as a comprehensive approach rather than simply  rearranging subjects.  Using many classroom examples, he explains the relationship between curriculum integration and the disciplines of knowledge. The approach set forth in this groundbreaking volume translates into a democratic vision of general education that transcends the current standards movement.  Offers clear and understandable examples of what curriculum integration means, how it can work, and how it fits a model of democratic education.   Choice  In this time of conservative attacks on progressive education, it is crucial that we defend and extend democratic policies and practices.

It provides a clear and insightful picture of the arguments and realities of democratic curriculum development and teaching.   Michael W.

Music Theory is targeted to pre-college students of all levels, both children and adults, and is drawn largely from the materials the author has developed for her own students over the years of teaching.This collection was originally conceived as a supplement to the Russian School of Piano Playing (Russian Piano School) book series, which is an English translation of the popular Russian piano method book. A number of piano teachers, both Russian and American who use the Russian Piano School method, have noted the need for a comprehensive music theory supplement. Music Theory is intended to fill this gap, though it can be used effectively with any piano method. Moreover, the Music Theory books have evolved beyond their original conception as a supplement to the Russian Piano School books, incorporating more advanced concepts and skills than those found in the Russian Piano School series, which stops at intermediate levels.What makes these Music Theory books unique:* This collection is expected to be one of a kind written in English language. Such advanced concepts as tonality, functionality, chromatic intervals, enharmonicism, all forms of resolutions, all forms of cadences and modulations, etc. have never been included in any pre-college or college introductory courses; therefore, the books of high intermediate and advanced levels are extremely helpful for the students who plan to continue their musical education in college.* The Music Theory collection uniquely combines textbook and workbook (theory and practice) and student and teacher books in each volume, providing greater ease of instruction for both teachers and students at every level.* This series of theory books provides the sheer number of musical examples. It focuses on the development of student's analytical and logical skills. This is accomplished by offering a number of questions to each musical example about various musical components (key, tonality, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, expression tools) that lead the student to his/her own conclusion about the uniqueness of a concrete musical work. With every analysis of a musical example, the student's attention is drawn to the style and genre of a musical piece, to the historical period in which it was composed and the background of a composer.* Starting with level 1B, each book includes additional biographical articles about composers and musical genres either in the footnotes or in the appendix/endnotes - a concise \\"encyclopedia\\" for a student to turn to when he/she needs to answer the questions about genres, styles and composers' backgrounds.* The books include a number of comparison exercises that present comparative analysis of two or three music pieces. These exercises largely contribute to students' understanding of a musical style at its every level - from the historical period in which the music work was written to the individual composer's style and the style of a concrete musical work.* This collection offers, through the \\"performance tips\\" throughout the books, an important connection between theory concepts and piano performance. This connection is also supported by musical terminology review. Students' attention is consistently brought to the new music terms as they first appear in musical examples. This helps the student to comprehend and memorize important musical terms in relation to performance.* The unique teaching tools offered in this series encourage students to look more closely and deeply at the music, and intensifies their ability to read music quickly and effectively. Upon completion of the theory training in these books, a student should be able to \\"sketch\\" a musical image in his/her mind just by looking at the score, before he/she even begins to play it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RmJJFu4qqE8C&dq=Wanting+To+Be+Born&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Offset Printing Machine Operator (Career Examination series)","description":"The Offset Printing Machine Operator Passbook(R) prepares you for your test by allowing you to take practice exams in the subjects you need to study.

The extensive scope of the study is a significant contribution to scholarly material on the artist, attending to difficult questions around art and ethics; its analysis of Margolles s work is situated within the contexts of the long tradition of the display of real bodies and body parts in Mexican visual culture, against the backdrop of the effects of NAFTA and the War on Drugs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SjonDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up the Back & Down the Front (Better Sweaters from \\"The Gourmet of Knitting\\" - No Shoulder Seams)","description":"Leila Marino's biggest dream is to become a rock star.

Diomede uses the text of two lengthy interviews with the writer to discover the themes of love, death, women, beauty, rebellion, and the mystery of life that can be found in DiDonato's works. He also touches on DiDonato's writing process.\\" \\"Diomede then incorporates these concepts into a critical analysis of several of DiDonato's works, including his novels, This Woman, Christ in Concrete, and Three Circles of Light; a play, The Love of Annunziata; two biographies, Immigrant Saint: The Life of Mother Cabrini and The Penitent; and an essay, Christ in Plastic. Central to Diomede's analysis are two concepts of analyst Carl Jung - that dreams can prove valuable in understanding ourselves and that full human realization occurs when a person takes on a father (male) component and a mother (female) component. Diomede also explores the development of DiDonato's autobiographical character, Paul/Paolo, in three novels and a play. He then demonstrates the value of dreams by tracing Paul's dream/nightmare in Christ in Concrete through DiDonato's oeuvre to the character's fullest development in This Woman, the pinnacle of DiDonato's work. Besides exploring the Jungian concepts in DiDonato's biographies, Diomede demonstrates how love is the \\"concrete\\" that is central to the author's work.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

He began what is today called the Hare Krishna movement, since the movement's founder, Srila Prabhupada, comes in the Chaitanya line of spiritual masters. Lord Chaitanya transformed the face of India in four respects: philosophically, by encountering, defeating and converting the greatest philosophers and thinkers of His day; religiously, by organizing the largest, most widespread theistic movement in India's history; socially, by His strong challenges to the religious inequities of the caste system; politically, by His organization of a massive civil disobedience movement in Bengal, more than four centuries before Gandhi.

How does a teacher connect geography and art and language in a way that enlivens the souls of children? What does a child's respect for the teacher mean for later life? These are only a few practical aspects of this initial course for Waldorf teachers. During an intensive two weeks, Rudolf Steiner gave three simultaneous educational courses to those who would be the first teachers of the original Waldorf school. One course provided the foundational ideas behind Waldorf education (The Foundations of Human Experience); another provided a forum for questions and lively discussions on specific issues in the classroom (Discussions with Teachers). In this course, Steiner takes the middle-path by integrating theory and practice. Here, Steiner spoke of new ways to teach reading, writing, geography, geometry, language, and much more. His approach is tailored to the spiritual and physical needs of the children themselves, not to an arbitrary curriculum based solely on external results. At a time when public education is in a state of crisis, this book describes how children around the world are being guided into adulthood with a fuller sense of themselves and with a creative approach to life and the world around them.

As World War II drew to a close and the world awakened to the horror wrought by white supremacists in Nazi Germany, African American leaders, led by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), sensed the opportunity to launch an offensive against the conditions of segregation and inequality in America. The 'prize' they sought was not civil rights, but human rights. Only the human rights lexicon, shaped by the Holocaust and articulated by the United Nations, contained the language and the moral power to address not only the political and legal inequality but also the education, health care, housing, and employment needs that haunted the black community. But the onset of the Cold War and rising anti-communism allowed powerful Southerners to cast those rights as Soviet-inspired. Thus the Civil Rights Movement was launched with neither the language nor the mission it needed to truly achieve black equality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XxAFCS5kWd0C&dq=Eyes+off+the+Prize:+The+United+Nations+and+the+African+American+Struggle+for+Human+Rights,+1944-1955&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Then, Suddenly (Pitt Poetry Series)","description":"Finalist for ForeWord Magazine s 1999 Poetry Book of the Year A reader and a writer don their respective roles and embark on the journey of a book. This is their story--ultimately a love story--darkly funny, mournful, testy. It is about a reader who at times presides over the page like a god, and at others follows the leash of the author's voice through the dark streets of the book like a dog, and it is about a writer of determined slipperiness. As we read, we think that each of us is The Reader, the one who knows the Real Story. But the more we think we understand, the more the story moves away from us all is not what it seems. This eagerly awaited third volume by the poet whose work The New York Times described as \\"at once charmed and frightening\\" is a book of high-spirited subversiveness, a work of argument, seduction, and a relentless devotion to language. Then, Suddenly  bristles with the sound of the author's voice--insistent, vital, hilarious, and iconoclastic--tearing away at the confinement of the page and at the distance between the page and the reader. Emanuel's images are dazzling. She creates a performance that is fearsome and funny in its portrayal of the argument between the work of the text and the world of the body.

But it wasn't until she was pregnant with her first child that she became intrigued with the study of brain development. She wanted to know precisely how the baby's brain is formed, and when and how each sense, skill, and cognitive ability is developed. And just as important, she was interested in finding out how her role as a nurturer can affect this complex process. How much of her baby's development is genetically ordained--and how much is determined by environment? Is there anything parents can do to make their babies' brains work better--to help them become smarter, happier people? Drawing upon the exploding research in this field as well as the stories of real children, What's Going On in There? is a lively and thought-provoking book that charts the brain's development from conception through the critical first five years. In examining the many factors that play crucial roles in that process, What's Going On in There? explores the evolution of the senses, motor skills, social and emotional behaviors, and mental functions such as attention, language, memory, reasoning, and intelligence. This remarkable book also discusses: how a baby's brain is \\"assembled\\" from scratch the critical prenatal factors that shapebrain development how the birthing process itself affects the brain which forms of stimulation are most effective at promoting cognitive development how boys' and girls' brains develop differently how nutrition, stress, and other physical and social factors can permanently affect a child's brain Brilliantly blending cutting-edge science with a mother's wisdom and insight, What's Going On in There? is an invaluable contribution to the nature versus nurture debate. Children's development is determined both by the genes they are born with and the richness of their early environment. This timely and important book shows parents the innumerable ways in which they can actually help their children grow better brains.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MJx3WzskrbcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Siege: Castles at War","description":"Surveys the fortifications that the ancients employed to defend themselves and how these fortresses evolved into the castles of the Middle Ages","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-n4dvgAACAAJ&dq=Siege:+Castles+at+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pig That Wants to Be Eaten","description":"The Granta backlist classic: a collection of short, accessible philosophical quandaries to stimulate, challenge and entertain!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-WIyH-d9h5UC&dq=Pig+That+Wants+to+Be+Eaten&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can Go Home Again","description":"A family therapist uses the family trees of famous dynasties--such as the Kennedys--to show how behavior repeats itself from one generation to the next and to examine the effects of birth order and other factors","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5-oKVx-EVwgC&dq=You+Can+Go+Home+Again&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speculative Fiction Centre 2005 Anthology HORIZONS","description":"The SPECULATIVE FICTION CENTRE has selected some of the best stories published during the year for HORIZONS, a 2005 Anthology!

It addresses test selection issues, provides insightful discussions of how to confront confirmatory biases and avoid the distortion of test findings, and presents clear instructions for the use of specific tests, including MMPI-2 and Rorschach, and a point/counterpoint discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the Ackerman-Schoendorf Scales for Parent Evaluation of Custody (ASPECT). Psychological Testing in Child Custody Evaluations can be viewed as a work in three parts. The first section addresses theoretical and test usage issues, with chapters focusing on: addressing test selection issues from legal and psychological perspectives bias issues that interfere with the evaluator s ability to collect and consider data objectively a functional, comprehensive approach to the use of psychological tests in a child custody evaluation with a conceptual framework for choosing assessment techniques to assess parenting competencies and other variables important in forming opinions about custodial placement and visitation access, and a practical example of how to present psychological test data in an advisory report to the court a look at psychological testing from an attorney s point of view The second section of Psychological Testing in Child Custody Evaluations focuses on the MMPI-2 and the Rorschach Inkblot Test in the child custody context, investigating hypotheses that can be inferred from the MMPI-2 regarding parenting behaviors, and the use and value of the Rorschach. This section examines: the foundation from which the MMPI-2 can generate expectations regarding five basic issues the quality of attachment and bonding, potential for antisocial behavior, temper control, alienation of affection, and chemical abuse and dependence the range of variables that will generate useful hypotheses regarding parent-child interactions and family systems the effects of the circumstances of litigation on score elevations including recommended limits as to how much elevation can be dismissed as only contextual the important differences between occasion validity and attribute validity the clinical application of an objective interpretation system, including the courtroom credibility of explicit convergent validity the use of the Rorschach in child custody evaluations findings from a study using the Rorschach to address specific parenting variables The third section of Psychological Testing in Child Custody Evaluations is a focused point-counterpoint discussion of ASPECT, between test creator Marc J.

In this book we are concerned with the construction of the former. Our intent is to provide the reader with a firm theoretical basis for compiler construction and sound engineering principles for selecting alternate methods, imple menting them, and integrating them into a reliable, economically viable product. The emphasis is upon a clean decomposition employing modules that can be re-used for many compilers, separation of concerns to facilitate team programming, and flexibility to accommodate hardware and system constraints. A reader should be able to understand the questions he must ask when designing a compiler for language X on machine Y, what tradeoffs are possible, and what performance might be obtained. He should not feel that any part of the design rests on whim; each decision must be based upon specific, identifiable characteristics of the source and target languages or upon design goals of the compiler. The vast majority of computer professionals will never write a compiler. Nevertheless, study of compiler technology provides important benefits for almost everyone in the field . ? It focuses attention on the basic relationships between languages and machines. Understanding of these relationships eases the inevitable tran sitions to new hardware and programming languages and improves a person's ability to make appropriate tradeoft's in design and implementa tion .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0u3pBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diary of a Confederate Soldier: John S.

In this uplifting book Kristina Turner applies esoteric knowledge to show practical ways of transforming a difficult experience into a positive and deeply spiritual one. Kristina looks closely at the physical processes that take place in the body during pregnancy and childbirth, as well at explaining the facts behind hospital procedures and options for home birth -- providing readers with the necessary knowledge to make their own choices. She feels that birthing should be viewed as a unified process, from the nine months of pregnancy through labour to the many months of breastfeeding; all three stages contribute to developing the bond between mother and child and the child's emotional function. Kristina writes beautifully about the sacred mystery inherent in conception and pregnancy, and guides the new mother towards being a conscious participant in the spiritual process of bringing life into this world.

This is not a fully fledged grand theory that aims to provide an explanation of everything, but an attempt to provide a rationale for taking an ecological world view and applying it to language education, which I regard as one of the most important of all human activities. Goethe once said that everything has been thought of before, but that the difficulty is to think of it again. The same certainly is true of the present effort. If it has any innovative ideas to offer, these lie in a novel combination of thoughts and ideas that have been around for a long, long time. The reader will encounter influences that range from Spinoza to Bakhtin and from Vygotsky to Halliday. The scope of the work is intentionally broad, covering all major themes that are part of the language learning process and the language teaching profession. These themes include language, perception and action, self, learning, critical pedagogy and research. At the same time I have attempted to look at both the macro and the micro sides of the ecological coin, and address issues from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. This, then, aims to be a book that can be read by practitioners and theoreticians alike, and the main idea is that it should be readable and challenging at the same time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m9QRBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Floating on the Missouri","description":"Memoir of a trip on Montana's Missouri River in 1901.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8i9BPgAACAAJ&dq=Floating+on+the+Missouri&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Shark Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PLcJPQAACAAJ&dq=Great+Shark+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Room","description":"In The Dark Room, the experiences of three people are evoked with stunning emotional depth and psychological authenticity. A boy born with a physical deformity finds work as a photographer's assistant during the 1930s and captures on film the changing temper of Berlin, the city he loves. But his acute photographic eye never provides him with the power to understand the significance of what he sees through his camera. In the weeks following Germany's surrender, a teenage girl whose parents are both in Allied captivity takes her younger siblings on a terrifying, illegal journey through the four zones of occupation in search of her grandmother. Many years after the event, a young man trying to discover why the Russians imprisoned his grandfather for nine years after the war meets resistance at every turn; the only person who agrees, reluctantly, to help him has his own tainted past to contend with.

As Diana Morrison laid the table for six at her elegant Central Park apartment, there was no warning of what was to come. Spending New Year s Eve together was a sacred tradition for Diana, her husband of thirty-two years, Eric, and their best friends, Pascale and John Donnally and Anne and Robert Smith. The future looked rosy as the long-time friends sipped champagne and talked of renting a villa together in the South of France the following summer. But life had other plans . . . Just two weeks after New Year s, tragedy strikes the heart of their close circle, as Robert Smith suffers a sudden, unexpected loss. Without hesitation, Diana and Eric, Pascale and John rally to his side, united in their support, love, and shared grief. Convinced that a change of scenery is just what Robert needs, they urge him to join them on the Riviera in August. But as they soon discover, the ramshackle old mansion they rented in St. Tropez--sight unseen--is far different from the exquisite villa and sun-drenched gardens touted in the brochure. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling. Beds collapse beneath them. All while a would-be housekeeper in a leopard-skin bikini and six-inch heels sashays through the house with a trio of yapping poodles at her heels. But the biggest surprise of all is the woman Robert invites to the villa as his guest--a lovely, much-younger film actress with mile-long legs and a million-dollar smile. Diana and Pascale hate her on sight. But the men are dazzled. And amid the crumbling furniture and the glorious sunsets, the strained relationships and the acts of forgiveness, more surprises are in store for the villa s occupants. With the last days of summer fast approaching, each couple finds themselves changing in unexpected ways, as old wounds are healed, new love discovered, and miracles unfold...all beneath the dazzling sun of St. Tropez. By turns wise and moving, heartbreaking and wickedly funny, Danielle Steel s new novel is about forgiving without forgetting, about the sorrow that shadows our lives and the hope that saves us. And it is about once-in-a-lifetime friendships . . .the kind that heal, sustain, and change us forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J9E1BVHVvZwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smart Moves: 140 Checklists To Bring Out The Best From You And And Your Team, Revised Edition","description":"Smart Moves has the right moves for every task managers face-writing reports, resolving conflicts, budgeting time, hiring employees, and much more.

Northern Union Railroad has been experiencing a series of accidents with their freight trains, but it is not until they find a freight car covered with blood that they call in outside help. Peter Tyler used to be a cop, until he nearly beat a black man to death and lost his badge. When he gets a second chance via an old friend at the National Transportation Safety Board, he drives a convertible through a snowstorm with the top down (he suffers from claustrophobia) to view the freight car. He arrives at the scene to discover that he will have to deal with Northern Union's own security officer, Nell Priest, a black woman who already knows Tyler's history. Meanwhile, Umberto Alvarez, the train wrecker, is systematically working his way towards his ultimate wreck, Northern's F.A.S.T. train, due to make its maiden run from New York to Washington, D.C. Alvarez lost his wife and children when their car stalled between the gates at a crossing and were crushed by one of Northern's trains. Although Northern Union was cleared of all responsibility and Alvarez's wife was found negligent, he doesn't think that's so. As Peter Tyler's investigation proceeds, he begins to come to the same conclusion. Closing in on Alvarez, he tries to interview the crossing guard who was on duty the day the wreck occurred. On arriving at the man's apartment, he finds the man bludgeoned to death--with the same stick with which Tyler beat the black man all that time ago. It's time to get paranoid. Who at Northern is covering up and what role does Nell play in all this? As always in a Ridley Pearson thriller, the action doesn't stop until the final page. --Otto Penzler","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XeeYAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Grains: Why Gluten Cereal Grains May Be Hazardous To Your Health","description":"Learn the shocking truth about how gluten cereal grains effect our health Could gluten be contributing to your fatigue, stress, bloating, and ill health?

Here, in his own words, is the story of his life public and private told in a book both frank and compellingly readable. Few presidents have accomplished more, or been so effective in changing the direction of government in ways that are both fundamental and lasting, than Ronald Reagan. Certainly no president has more dramatically raised the American spirit, or done so much to restore national strength and self-confidence. Here, then, is a truly American success story a great and inspiring one. From modest beginnings as the son of a shoe salesman in Tampico, Illinois, Ronald Reagan achieved first a distinguished career in Hollywood and then, as governor of California and as president of the most powerful nation in the world, a career of public service unique in our history. Ronald Reagan s account of that rise is told here with all the uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit that made him perhaps the most able communicator ever to occupy the White House, and also with the sense of drama of a gifted natural storyteller. He tells us, with warmth and pride, of his early years and of the elements that made him, in later life, a leader of such stubborn integrity, courage, and clear-minded optimism. Reading the account of this childhood, we understand how his parents, struggling to make ends meet despite family problems and the rigors of the Depression, shaped his belief in the virtues of American life the need to help others, the desire to get ahead and to get things done, the deep trust in the basic goodness, values, and sense of justice of the American people virtues that few presidents have expressed more eloquently than Ronald Reagan. With absolute authority and a keen eye for the details and the anecdotes that humanize history, Ronald Reagan takes the reader behind the scenes of his extraordinary career, from his first political experiences as president of the Screen Actors Guild (including his first meeting with a beautiful young actress who was later to become Nancy Reagan) to such high points of his presidency as the November 1985 Geneva meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, during which Reagan invited the Soviet leader outside for a breath of fresh air and then took him off for a walk and a man-to-man chat, without aides, that set the course for arms reduction and charted the end of the Cold War. Here he reveals what went on behind his decision to enter politics and run for the governorship of California, the speech nominating Barry Goldwater that first made Reagan a national political figure, his race for the presidency, his relations with the members of his own cabinet, and his frustrations with Congress. He gives us the details of the great themes and dramatic crises of his eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, from Iran-Contra to the visits abroad that did so much to reestablish the United States in the eyes of the world as a friendly and peaceful power. His narrative is full of insights, from the unseen dangers of Gorbachev s first visit to the United States to Reagan s own personal correspondence with major foreign leaders, as well as his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family and the enduring love between himself and Mrs. Reagan. An American Life is a warm, richly detailed, and deeply human book, a brilliant self-portrait, a significant work of history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aZs2Kk7tn94C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uprock Headspin Scramble and Dive: Poems","description":"The debut collection from a vibrant, streetwise voice: Winner of the 2002 Members' Choice Award from the Asian American Writers Workshop.

L. Hunley is as astonishing as its disappearance. On February 17, 1864, after a legendary encounter with a Union battleship, the iron  fish boat  vanished without a trace somewhere off the coast of South Carolina. For more than a century the fate of the Hunley remained one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Civil War. Then, on August 8, 2000, with thousands of spectators crowding Charleston Harbor, the Hunley was raised from the bottom of the sea and towed ashore. Now, award-winning journalists Brian Hicks and Schuyler Kropf offer new insights into the Hunley s final hours and recount the amazing true story of its rescue. The brainchild of wealthy New Orleans planter and lawyer Horace Lawson Hunley, the Hunley inspired tremendous hopes of breaking the Union s naval blockade of Charleston, only to drown two crews on disastrous test runs. But on the night of February 17, 1864, the Hunley finally made good on its promise. Under the command of the heroic Lieutenant George E. Dixon, the sub rammed a spar torpedo into the Union sloop Housatonic and sank the ship within minutes, accomplishing a feat of stealth technology that would not be repeated for half a century. And then, shortly after its stunning success, the Hunley vanished. This book is an extraordinary true story peopled with a fascinating cast of characters, including Horace Hunley himself, the Union officers and crew who went down with the Housatonic, P. T. Barnum, who offered $100,000 for its recovery, and novelist Clive Cussler, who spearheaded the mission that finally succeeded in finding the Hunley. The drama of salvaging the sub is only the prelude to a page-turning account of how scientists unsealed this archaeological treasure chest and discovered the inner-workings of a submarine more technologically advanced than anyone expected, as well as numerous, priceless artifacts. Hicks and Kropf have crafted a spellbinding adventure story that spans over a century of American history. Dramatically told, filled with historical details and contemporary color, illustrated with breathtaking original photographs, Raising the Hunley is one of the most fascinating Civil War books to appear in years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y1Bv8aoZ4qMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart Of Rachael","description":"Rachael is locked in a marital relationship with an alcoholic who tends to make life a living hell for her.

But despite its incredible past that extends to its first foundations as far back as the 9th Century BC, it is often overlooked by tourists who rarely venture here from nearby Rome. But with so much to offer travelers, it s about time Naples was given the attention it deserves. Panoramic Vista As landscapes and views go, the Bay of Naples is hard to beat. The curvature of the marina extends around the coastline until it meets the towering figure of Mount Vesuvius in the nearby National Park. The sea is beautifully clear, and it s a well-tended, cared for place. The good looks of the city have lent themselves to the lyrics of songs written about it, with the Neapolitan Torna a Sorrento (Come Back to Sorrento), being one of the most popular. Museums and Churches of Naples Naples is a museum in itself, and within the city, boundaries lie many churches, museums and historical sites ready to captivate travelers. The Duomo (cathedral) of San Gennaro, the patron saint of Naples, is one of the most visually spectacular in the region, while the Cappella di Santa Restituta is one of the country s oldest surviving churches. And for lovers of the Baroque-style architecture, a visit to the church San Giuseppe dei Ruffi is a fascinating visit. Pizza Naples is considered to be the birthplace of pizza, with its origins dating back to the 16th Century. The different sauces that top the pizza each have a different story. The Margherita is reported to have been created in 1889 for the then Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy. Back then it was just a topping of seasoned tomatoes, but that has since evolved to include white mozzarella cheese and green basil to replicate the colors of the Italian flag. This guide leads you in a visit to Naples and the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida. It also covers the ruins of Pompeii and the Royal Palace of Caserta. It includes color photos and descriptions of the attractions of all the localities touched, as well as info on Campania s cuisine and recipes. It has plenty of practical advice on travel to reach the islands and how to move once you are there. It is ideal for use on your smartphone as it contains active links to the websites of many reviews for the best-recommended restaurants that are at the location described.

A Buddhist classic. Nagarjuna's poetic presentation of the fundamental teachings of the Great Vehicle, or Mahayana, is remarkable for its concise style and memorable imagery, making it one of the most widely quoted sources in other commentaries on the Mahayana path. The great Indian Buddhist master Nagarjuna (first-second century C.E.) wrote his celebrated poem \\"Letter to a Friend\\" as a gift of advice to a South Indian king, and it has since become a monument in the Indian shastra tradition. Despite its short length (only 123 verses), Nagarjuna's \\"Letter to a Friend\\" covers the entire Mahayana path, combining a practical approach to daily conduct with a theoretical exposition of the different stages leading to enlightenment. It has thus been an ideal source for many of Tibet's great scholars seeking a scriptural authority to enhance their own descriptions of the Buddhist path. Any difficulties in understanding the poem are overcome here by Kangyur Rinpoche's commentary, which turns Nagarjuna's sometimes cryptic poem into straightforward prose, expanding on each topic and ordering the different subjects in such a way that on returning to the original poem, the reader can easily make sense of the advice it contains. It includes headings to explain Nagarjuna's frequent changes in subject and full explanations of the ideas introduced in each verse. In addition to the commentary, this book presents the original poem in the Tibetan and in a new English translation that attempts to emulate Nagarjuna's lines of metric verse. Also included are Kangyur Rinpoche's structural outline (sa bchad), a Tibetan line index to enable students to locate quotations used in other Tibetan works, full notes, and a glossary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i7xvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Nagarjuna%27s+Letter+To+A+Friend:+With+Commentary+By+Kangyur+Rinpoche&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Healthcare & the Consumer Experience: Four Scenarios","description":"A New York Times bestseller/Washington Post Notable Book of 2017/NPR Best Books of 2017/Wall Street Journal Best Books of 2017 \\"This book will serve as the definitive guide to the past and future of health care in America.  Siddhartha Mukherjee, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Emperor of All Maladies and The Gene At a moment of drastic political upheaval, An American Sickness is a shocking investigation into our dysfunctional healthcare system - and offers practical solutions to its myriad problems. In these troubled times, perhaps no institution has unraveled more quickly and more completely than American medicine. In only a few decades, the medical system has been overrun by organizations seeking to exploit for profit the trust that vulnerable and sick Americans place in their healthcare. Our politicians have proven themselves either unwilling or incapable of reining in the increasingly outrageous costs faced by patients, and market-based solutions only seem to funnel larger and larger sums of our money into the hands of corporations. Impossibly high insurance premiums and inexplicably large bills have become facts of life; fatalism has set in. Very quickly Americans have been made to accept paying more for less. How did things get so bad so fast? Breaking down this monolithic business into the individual industries the hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers that together constitute our healthcare system, Rosenthal exposes the recent evolution of American medicine as never before. How did healthcare, the caring endeavor, become healthcare, the highly profitable industry? Hospital systems, which are managed by business executives, behave like predatory lenders, hounding patients and seizing their homes. Research charities are in bed with big pharmaceutical companies, which surreptitiously profit from the donations made by working people. Patients receive bills in code, from entrepreneurial doctors they never even saw. The system is in tatters, but we can fight back. Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal doesn't just explain the symptoms, she diagnoses and treats the disease itself. In clear and practical terms, she spells out exactly how to decode medical doublespeak, avoid the pitfalls of the pharmaceuticals racket, and get the care you and your family deserve. She takes you inside the doctor-patient relationship and to hospital C-suites, explaining step-by-step the workings of a system badly lacking transparency. This is about what we can do, as individual patients, both to navigate the maze that is American healthcare and also to demand far-reaching reform. An American Sickness is the frontline defense against a healthcare system that no longer has our well-being at heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I_9MDwAAQBAJ&dq=American+Healthcare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superman Returns: Library Edition","description":"Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Ma Kent all react differently to Superman's long absence, in this collection of comic books that bridges the events in Superman and those in Superman Returns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MdPkYQec8VYC&dq=Superman+Returns:+Library+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Augustine Confessions (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"In his own day the dominant personality of the Western Church, Augustine of Hippo today stands as perhaps the greatest thinker of Christian antiquity, and his Confessions is one of the great works of Western literature. In this intensely personal narrative, Augustine relates his rare ascent from a humble Algerian farm to the edge of the corridors of power at the imperial court in Milan, his struggle against the domination of his sexual nature, his renunciation of secular ambition and marriage, and the recovery of the faith his mother Monica had taught him during his childhood. Now, Henry Chadwick, an eminent scholar of early Christianity, has given us the first new English translation in thirty years of this classic spiritual journey. Chadwick renders the details of Augustine's conversion in clear, modern English. We witness the future saint's fascination with astrology and with the Manichees, and then follow him through scepticism and disillusion with pagan myths until he finally reaches Christian faith. There are brilliant philosophical musings about Platonism and the nature of God, and touching portraits of Augustine's beloved mother, of St. Ambrose of Milan, and of other early Christians like Victorinus, who gave up a distinguished career as a rhetorician to adopt the orthodox faith. Augustine's concerns are often strikingly contemporary, yet his work contains many references and allusions that are easily understood only with background information about the ancient social and intellectual setting. To make The Confessions accessible to contemporary readers, Chadwick provides the most complete and informative notes of any recent translation, and includes an introduction to establish the context. The religious and philosophical value of The Confessions is unquestionable--now modern readers will have easier access to St. Augustine's deeply personal meditations. Chadwick's lucid translation and helpful introduction clear the way for a new experience of this classic. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

A thoroughly worthwhile book  (Italy Magazine). Growing up under Mussolini s Fascist regime on a farm near Florence, Pietro Pinti and his family lived under conditions of extreme poverty, as sharecroppers to generally unscrupulous landowners. But during World War II, when millions in towns and cities suffered untold hardships, the hardy Tuscan peasants were well equipped to face the rigors of the era: war or no war, work on the land went on, and Pietro describes month by month a typical year in their lives: how they made wine and olive oil, planted and harvested the wheat by hand, made baskets and ladders from chestnut wood-skills now lost. With sly wit and salty wisdom, Pietro a natural storyteller who played the trumpet, wrote poetry, and grew famous for his tales of peasants, knights, and brigands recreates in colorful detail a world and peasant culture that is fast disappearing. Jenny Bawtree, an Englishwoman long settled in Tuscany, was so fascinated by Pietro's stories that she helped shape them into this autobiography, full of color and humor, hardship and nostalgia.  This small, cherishable book is as close to living history as one gets . . . The heart of the book, though, is Pinti s month-by-month description of how it was to live . . . The stories are full of humanity and sly wisdom.

The critically acclaimed standalone thriller from the King of Helsinki Noir... ***Shortlisted for the Petrona Award for Best Scandinavian Crime Novel of the Year*** ***Shortlisted for the CrimeFest Last Laugh Award*** 'Right up there with the best' Times Literary Supplement 'Deftly plotted, poignant and perceptive in its wry reflections on mortality and very funny' Irish Times 'Told in a darkly funny, deadpan style ... The result is a rollercoaster read in which the farce has some serious and surprisingly philosophical underpinnings' Guardian  A successful entrepreneur in the mushroom industry, Jaakko Kaunismaa is a man in his prime. At just thirty-seven years of age, he is shocked when his doctor tells him that he's dying. What's more, the cause is discovered to be prolonged exposure to toxins; in other words, someone has slowly but surely been poisoning him.

E. Peters skillfully combines extensive passages from Islamic texts with a fascinating commentary of his own. In so doing, he presents a substantial body of literary evidence that will enable the reader to grasp the bases of Muslim faith and, more, to get some sense of the breadth and depth of Islamic religious culture as a whole. The voices recorded here are those of Muslims engaged in discourse with their God and with each other--historians, lawyers, mystics, and theologians, from the earliest Companions of the Prophet Muhammad down to Ibn Rushd or \\"Averroes\\" (d. 1198), al-Nawawi (d. 1278), and Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406). These religious seekers lived in what has been called the \\"classical\\" period in the development of Islam, the era when the exemplary works of law and spirituality were written, texts of such universally acknowledged importance that subsequent generations of Muslims gratefully understood themselves as heirs to an enormously broad and rich legacy of meditation on God's Word. \\"Islam\\" is a word that seems simple to understand. It means \\"submission,\\" and, more specifically in the context where it first and most familiarly appears, \\"submission to the will of God.\\" That context is the Quran, the Sacred Book of the Muslims, from which flow the patterns of belief and practice that today claim the spiritual allegiance of hundreds of millions around the globe. By drawing on the works of the great masters--Islam in its own words--Peters enriches our understanding of the community of \\"those who have submitted\\" and their imposing religious and political culture, which is becoming ever more important to the West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KnAO36Jh6bMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Petit Larousse Illustre 1999-French","description":"In his translation of Thoulet's travelogue, Scott Jamieson remains faithful to the elegance and wit of the original.

Offering a sweeping view of this elusive and controversial aspect of religious life and culture, Asceticism looks at the ascetic impulse from a unique vantage point. Cross-cultural, cross-religious, and multidisciplinary in nature, these essays provide a broad historical and comparative perspective on asceticism--a subject rarely studied outside the context of individual religious traditions. The work represents the input of more than forty preeminent scholars in a wide range of fields and disciplines, and analyzes asceticism from antiquity to the present in European, Near Eastern, African, Asian, and North American settings. Asceticism is organized around four major themes that cut across religious traditions: origins and meanings of asceticism, which explores the motivations and impulses behind ascetic behaviors; hermeneutics of asceticism, which looks at texts and rhetorics and their presuppositions; aesthetics of asceticism, which documents responses evoked by ascetic impulses and practices, as well as the arts of ascetic practices themselves; and politics of asceticism, which analyzes the power dynamics of asceticism, especially as regards gender, cultural, and ethnic differences. Critical responses to the major papers ensure the focus upon the themes and unify the discussion. Two general addresses on broad philosophical and historical-interpretive issues suggest the importance of the subject of asceticism for wide-ranging but serious cultural-critical discussions. An Appendix, Ascetica Miscellanea, includes six short papers on provocative topics not related to the four major themes, and a panel discussion on the practices and meanings of asceticism in contemporary religious life and culture. A selected bibliography and an index are also included. The only comprehensive reference work on asceticism with a multicultural, multireligious, and multidisciplinary perspective, Asceticism offers a model not only for an understanding of a most important dimension of religious life, but also for future interdisciplinary study in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2nk8DwAAQBAJ&dq=Asceticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hollywood Hardcore Diaries: Erotic Tales from a Porn Reporter","description":"A collection of 14 erotic stories inspired by,real-life diary entries, this is the first book in,a new series published by Companion.

He found a continent where brutal murder had become routine, where dictators and warlords silenced dissent with machine guns and machetes, and where starvation had become depressingly common. With a great deal of personal anguish, Richburg faced a difficult question: If this is Africa, what does it mean to be an African American? In this provocative and unvarnished account of his three years on the continent of his ancestors, Richburg takes us on a extraordinary journey that sweeps from Somalia to South Africa, showing how he confronted the divide between his African racial heritage and his American cultural identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NT84swEACAAJ&dq=Out+of+America:+A+Black+Man+Confronts+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MKqJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eichler Homes: Design for Living","description":"Catalogue of an exhibition held at the Faculty of Architecture Gallery, Architecture II Building (main floor), the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, September 10-28, 1998.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Z_-K4Ss-RoC&dq=Eichler+Homes:+Design+for+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreams of Distant Lives","description":" This is a writer whose language explores the range of life.

When she set out in 1991, Victoria, already a grandmother of two, had only been kayaking for a year and was still recovering from the second of two strokes. Her 7,500 kilometre journey lasted four years. In the first year, Fred Reffler dropped out due to an injury, and Victoria suffered serious internal bleeding from ulcers. The second year Victoria and Don reached Gjoa Haven together, hauling their kayaks by sled, but Victoria was forced to drop out there, suffering from edema (muscle breakdown) caused by excessive fatigue. Don Starkell continued alone, reaching the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, where he was rescued by authorities suffering from severe frostbite which resulted in the loss of all his fingers and parts of four toes. Their first two summers together were also a time of tension and conflict between Victoria and Don. Not content with failure, Victoria returned North the following two years and completed her triumphant journey alone from west to east, paddling from Fort Providence on the Mackenzie River to Paulatuk in 1993, and from Paulatuk to Gjoa Haven in 1994. Among the Inuit people she became known as the Kabloona (the Inuktituk word for stranger) in the Yellow Kayak.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I3CvPQAACAAJ&dq=Kabloona+In+Yellow+Kayak&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Will There Really be a Morning?","description":"\\"Acknowledged as one of the world's most beautiful women and critically acclaimed as an actress, Frances Farmer suddenly toppled from stardom and plunged headlong into the terror-ridden world of the insane.

Were your parents always making you do things? Criticizing you? Or did you always get your own way? Were you often punished as a child? Did your parents continually fuss at you with anxious reminders and directions? Did you feel neglected, even unwanted? Or were you the boss of the family for whom all sacrifices were made? This remarkable book helps you to free yourself from the tensions that can be set up in childhood (even by parents who try hard to do their best) and continue to exhaust you in adult life. By describing--and illustrating with case histories--various child-parent relationships and their results, Dr. Missildine shows you how to recall the forgotten child you once were. He demonstrates how that child--who might have been overdisciplined or overindulged or subjected to any of a dozen common parental attitudes--still persists in the adult You. You see how your 'inner child of the past' continues to act out old habits, old angers, fears and confusions. That 'child' today makes you, perhaps, oversensitive, or unable to relate to people, or subject to rages or procrastination or compulsive spending or being overcritical of others (or of yourself), and in other ways causes you pain or disturbs your marriage or family or working life. To help you make peace with this 'inner child' and thus free your energies for adult living is the author's purpose. His concept of retraining the 'inner child' has led to happier, more productive lives for many of his own patients. In this book he speaks so clearly and interestingly, and with such warmth and sympathy, that you will find yourself relaxed and eager to begin discovering and coming to terms with your inner child of the past.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IxBsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Your+Inner+Child+of+the+Past&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fitzpatricks War","description":"In the twenty-sixth century, a new world, devoid of technology, is born after the apocalyptic Storm Times, and, from the ashes, arises a historical document that questions the heroic efforts of Isaac Prophet Fitzpatrick--the Consul and Supreme Commander of the Yukon Confederacy in the twenty-fifth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AjRbAAAACAAJ&dq=Fitzpatricks+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beautiful Borders, Backings and Bindings: A Quilters Guide to Fabulous Finishing Techniques","description":"A stunning border sampler, dozens of beautiful borders, backings and bindings and decorative practice projects provide inspiration and information in this comprehensive photographic how-to teaching guide.

The idea of writing autobiographical stories of her multilingual life came from her long-term commitment to foreign language teaching and from a recent, extremely rich and valuable experience teaching English to immigrants in the U.S. While reading and studying various aspects of second-language-related-theory -- linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and sociolinguistics literature -- the author realized how estranged language learners are from all the research, speculations, hypotheses, and achievements of scholarship. A Russian immigrant, the author tells stories to her ESL students to help them understand why and at what price successful language acquisition and acculturation is realistic. Not only can students learn from her stories which encourage discoveries about their own behaviors or problems, but they might want to respond and tell about their own struggles with a foreign language. By becoming writers and interpreters of her text and by making it their own, students can construct their own virtual texts. The stories told throughout are those of a language learner, who is also a linguist and language teacher. As such, they can bridge the gap between second language research and practical teaching and learning. Moreover, this book can help initiate language learners along with their teachers into scholarship. Second language teachers and graduate students preparing for a teaching career might see this book as an illustration and validation of the studied theory and an inner voice of their students at the same time. Multidisciplinary by nature, it can also be used in several college courses such as cultural anthropology, anthropo- and socio-linguistics, sociology, multicultural education, ethnography, bilingualism, and the study of immigrant experience.

Borchert first looks at the larger New Testament unit-gospels, Pauline letters, pastorals, etc. Then he takes each book in the section, passage by passage, and shows how worship constantly enters into the author's style and purpose in bringing that author's unique meaning to the individual context. He concludes each section with a terse Worship Summary of the biblical book and with questions for the reader to contemplate. Thus Borchert invites the reader to enter into the worship discussion and find ways to give depth, meaning, and hope to personal and congregational worship. At each step, Borchert underlines the deep connection between worship and life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=91o4ngEACAAJ&dq=Worship+in+the+New+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese Prints (Big Art)","description":"Ukiyo-e: 139 reproductions, grouped by artist, each accompanied by a detailed commentary This volume reproduces 139 Japanese woodblock colour prints by 43 famous masters of ukiyo-e, the popular art of the 17th to the 19th century. The originals are in the Riccar Art Museum in Tokyo, the world's largest and most celebrated collection of such prints. On account of their rarity and value, 87 of them have been designated Japanese National Treasures or Major National Cultural Heritage Items. The introductory essay, \\"Ukiyo-e - Origins and History\\", by the Curator of the Riccar Art Museum, Mitsunobu Sato, familiarizes the reader with the history of this art form. This is followed by the chapter \\"Cherry - Wood - Blossom\\", in which Thomas Zacharias, Professor at the Munich Academy of Art examines the technique, content and style of Japanese prints and their influence on European art at the turn of the century. The major section of the book consists of the 139 reproductions, grouped by artist, each accompanied by a detailed, sensitive commentary. Street scenes, lovers' trysts, festivals, portraits of courtesans and actors, landscapes and travelogues - these are the motifs of the ukiyo-e print. The dominant theme, however, is woman's beauty, the grace of her posture and attitudes, and the decorative aesthetics of her flowing garments. Amongst the most celebrated of the artists featured here are Utamaro, with his beautiful courtesans and geishas; Sharaku, with his portraits of actors on the kabuki stage; Hokusai, with his landscapes, among them the \\"36 Views of Mount Fuji\\"; and Hiroshige, with his \\"53 Stations on the Tokaido\\" and his \\"100 Views of Famous Places in and around Edo\\".

By turns amusing and probing, Summer Snow lays out in a series of linked essays the formative experiences that shaped Harris into the writer and intellectual she has become. With passion and eloquence, Harris writes about the creation of her unique first name, how porch-sitting is in fact a creative Southern tradition, and how insecurities over her black hair (\\"the ubiquitous hair\\") factored into her self-image. She writes about being a \\"black nerd\\" as a child, and how the black church influenced her in her early years. But she also writes about more troubling topics, such as the price blacks have paid for integration, and the \\"staying power of racism.\\" In one moving piece, Harris remembers a white teenager propositioning her for sex in exchange for five dollars. Unflinching in her assessment of white Southern culture, yet deeply attached to a South many black intellectuals have abandoned, Harris in Summer Snow takes readers on a surprising tour of one woman's life, loves, and lessons. Trudier Harris is the author of numerousbooks, including Saints, Sinners, Saviors: Strong Black Women in African American Literature and Fiction and Folklore: The Novels of Toni Morrison. She is currently a professor of English at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Praise for Summer Snow: \\"Stimulating and provocative, SUMMER SNOW resonates with folkloric energy and vividly evocative prose. Trudier Harris's presence and voice vibrate through this journey, guiding her reader with the sheer force of her rigor, grace, and intelligence as well as a goodly amount of wry humor and wit. A reader's dream-book, reminding us all of the resonant claim of southern spaces.\\" -- Karla Holloway, William Kenan Professor of English at Duke University, author of numerous books, including Passed On. \\"Trudier Harris speaks of the \\"cotton-pickin' authority\\" of those in her childhood who earned respect because of their life-long backbreaking labors in the fields. Harris has translated that authority into one of her own, the authority of her words. Because of this author, we see, feel, understand and celebrate our people, who created--through sheer wit and will--a culture that defeated the dehumanization of slavery by keeping us, body and soul alive. A wonderful book you have to read to believe.\\" --Toi Derricotte, author of The Black Notebooks. \\"Noon can be as blinding as midnight; snow no less than sun can cause a vision distortion. Like Zora Neale Hurston, another great daughter of the South, Harris lets her vision be tempered by her love. And make no mistake, the South of Black Americans, is a love story. SUMMER SNOW reminds us of that... causes us to remember that... lets us celebrate that.\\" --Nikki Giovanni \\"SUMMER SNOW is the classic we have been waiting for--the classic that only a \\"Black daughter of the South\\" could have written. It has dance and song, color and texture, pathos and humor, analysis and introspection, and a gallery of fascinating women and men we can never forget.\\" --Gloria Wade Gayles, author of PUSHED BACK TO STRENGTH","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TO2jdz6v5boC&dq=Summer+snow:+Reflections+from+a+Black+daughter+of+the+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Roundheads (Dr. Who Series)","description":"With the English Civil War won, the Parliamentarians are struggling to hang on to power.

Their compelling stories add a new dimension to current debates over corporate power and the public good. Dimitra Doukas draws on ten years of ethnographic and historical research on the Mohawk River Valley towns of Herkimer, Illion, Frankfort, and Mohawk, where the Remington company, maker of arms and typewriters among other things, was for many years the backbone of a thriving regional society. Corporate takeover of the varied Remington enterprises in 1886 sent shock waves through this society, ushering in a century of social distress and decreasing political autonomy. Since the 1970s, the area has suffered mightily from deindustrialization. Local experience, Doukas finds, has shaped an American culture of strongly egalitarian ideals. From this perspective, the region's present plight appears, to many in the region, as a betrayal of American values. Knitting together the ethnographic present, the remembered past, and the historical past, the author tracks today's discontent to the dawn of the modern corporate era for a revealing and intimate look at the rise of a new political and economic power structure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UblcDwAAQBAJ&dq=Worked+Over:+The+Corporate+Sabotage+of+an+American+Community&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Have Zip & Zest When You're 80","description":"O'Reilly's Pocket Guides have earned a reputation as inexpensive, comprehensive, and compact guides that have the stuff but not the fluff.

Pretty, smart, and pampered, Audrey Marie Hilley grew up in a small Alabama town believing she was entitled to the best of everything. But marriage to her high school sweetheart, a cushy secretarial job, and motherhood were not enough to satisfy Marie, and she soon began to act out in troubling ways. Only when her husband, Frank, became sick with a mysterious illness, did it seem that she was ready to put someone else s needs ahead of her own. The truth was far more disturbing. Four years after Frank died, Marie s daughter, Carol, began to experience debilitating stomach pains. The young woman was near death when the horrifying reality finally emerged: Marie had poisoned her husband with arsenic and was attempting to do the same to her daughter. It was the first in a series of shocking twists that exposed Marie Hilley as a cold-blooded chameleon capable of the most sinister of crimes. From Alabama to Florida to New Hampshire, her trail of death and deceit included multiple identities, a second marriage, a false kidnapping, a fake death, several dramatic escapes, and a final act of desperation that brought the whole sordid saga to an astonishing end.

Should nonagenarians receive costly medical care at taxpayer expense? Who should be first in line for kidney transplants the relatively healthy or the severely ill? In T argeting in Social Programs , Peter H. Schuck and Richard J. Zeckhauser provide a rigorous framework for analyzing these and other difficult choices. Many government policies seek to help unfortunate, often low-income individuals in other words, \\"bad draws.\\" These efforts are frequently undermined by poor targeting, however. In particular, when two groups of bad draws \\"bad bets\\" and \\"bad apples\\" are included in social welfare programs, bad policies are likely to result. Many politicians and policymakers prefer to sweep this problem under the rug. But the costs of this silence are high. Allocating resources to bad bets and bad apples does more than waste money it also makes it harder to achieve substantive goals, such as the creation of safe and effective schools. And perhaps most important, it erodes support for public programs on which many good bets and good apples rely. By training a spotlight on these issues, Schuck and Zeckhauser take a first step toward much-needed reforms. They dissect the challenges involved in defining bad bets and bad apples and discuss the safeguards that any classification process must provide. They also examine three areas where bad apples and bad bets loom large public schools, public housing, and medical care and propose policy changes that could reduce the problems these two groups pose. This provocative book does not offer easy answers, but it raises questions that no one with an interest in policy effectiveness can afford to ignore. By turns incisive and probing, Bad Draws will generate vigorous debate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xc2ypkRx3U8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gold Coins of the Dahlonega Mint 1838-1861","description":"Douglas Winter is regarded as one of the leading experts in the field of United States gold coins.

With so many speaking against him, The Washington Post asks: What is the case against Cosby? Bill Cosby has always played the good guy on stage and TV, building his career on his easygoing, family-friendly comic persona. So the overwhelming tide of sexual assault allegations against him is hard for many Americans to reconcile with the character they know from the airwaves. The accusations represent a stunning reshaping of his lifelong legacy in an extraordinarily short amount of time. Yet Cosby has yet to be charged with any crime. Cosby's attorney has called the accusations against the comedian \\"ridiculous.\\" His wife has defended him wholeheartedly, and Cosby himself has dismissed the charges as rumor and innuendo. The Washington Post has interviewed five of the women who accused Cosby of assaulting them. The women agreed to speak on the record and to have their identities revealed. The Post also has reviewed court records that shed light on the allegations of a former director of women s basketball operations at Temple University and the thirteen \\"Jane Doe\\" accusers who stood with her.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4X5pBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The problem of pain, (The Christian challenge series, ed. by Ashley Sampson)","description":"C. S. Lewis, long renowned for his children's books as well as his Christian apologetics, has been the subject of wide interest since he first stepped-up to the BBC's microphone during the Second World War. Until now, however, the reasons why this medievalist began writing books for a popular audience, and why these books have continued to be so popular, had not been fully explored. In fact Lewis, who once described himself as by nature an 'extreme anarchist', was a critical controversialist in his time-and not to everyone's liking. Yet, somehow, Lewis's books directed at children and middlebrow Christians have continued to resonate in the decades since his death in 1963. Stephanie L. Derrick considers why this is the case, and why it is more true in America than in Lewis's home-country of Britain. The story of C. S. Lewis's fame is one that takes us from his childhood in Edwardian Belfast, to the height of international conflict during the 1940s, to the rapid expansion of the paperback market, and on to readers' experiences in the 1980s and 1990s, and, finally, to London in November 2013, where Lewis was honoured with a stone in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. Derrick shows that, in fact, the author himself was only one actor among many shaping a multi-faceted image. The Fame of C. S. Lewis is the most comprehensive account of Lewis's popularity to date, drawing on a wealth of fresh material and with much to interest scholars and C. S. Lewis admirers alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yFhgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A reader's guide to The Silmarillion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oBSapwAACAAJ&dq=A+reader%27s+guide+to+The+Silmarillion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Development and Structures of Creole Languages: Essays in honor of Derek Bickerton (Creole Language Library)","description":"This collection of original essays is intended to both celebrate Derek Bickerton's sixty-fifth birthday and honor his long and eminent career.

But what is missing from the picture sexual difference can be as instructive as what is present. In this ambitious work, Roderick A. Ferguson reveals how the discourses of sexuality are used to articulate theories of racial difference in the field of sociology. He shows how canonical sociology Gunnar Myrdal, Ernest Burgess, Robert Park, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and William Julius Wilson has measured African Americans s unsuitability for a liberal capitalist order in terms of their adherence to the norms of a heterosexual and patriarchal nuclear family model. In short, to the extent that African Americans s culture and behavior deviated from those norms, they would not achieve economic and racial equality. Aberrations in Black tells the story of canonical sociology s regulation of sexual difference as part of its general regulation of African American culture. Ferguson places this story within other stories the narrative of capital s emergence and development, the histories of Marxism and revolutionary nationalism, and the novels that depict the gendered and sexual idiosyncrasies of African American culture works by Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, and Toni Morrison. In turn, this book tries to present another story one in which people who presumably manifest the dysfunctions of capitalism are reconsidered as indictments of the norms of state, capital, and social science. Ferguson includes the first-ever discussion of a new archival discovery a never-published chapter of Invisible Man that deals with a gay character in a way that complicates and illuminates Ellison s project. Unique in the way it situates critiques of race, gender, and sexuality within analyses of cultural, economic, and epistemological formations, Ferguson s work introduces a new mode of discourse which Ferguson calls queer of color analysis that helps to lay bare the mutual distortions of racial, economic, and sexual portrayals within sociology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ry90DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Immortality, Inc.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e9Z5AAAACAAJ&dq=Immortality,+Inc.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sandy Chisholm's Chanter Lessons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ji1xGwAACAAJ&dq=Sandy+Chisholm%27s+Chanter+Lessons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays on American Music: (Contributions in American History)","description":"A history of American music, its diversity, and the cultural influences that helped it develop.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5H75W2Gsz8AC&dq=Essays+on+American+Music:+(Contributions+in+American+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stories My Mother Never Told Me","description":"Through a series of letters from his parents' passionate World War II courtship, Morrison uncovers a startling, touching story.

But up to now opinion has been divided on the best way of studying tactics. The well-known Soviet international, grandmaster and chess author Averbakh has developed an entirely novel approach, which is expounded in the present work. His main aim was to create a theoretical basis with whose aid the learner can effortlessly study the numerous and manifold tactical problems facing the chess player. Averbakh begins by examining the simplest situations resulting from confrontations between different pieces. He then proceeds to analyze more complex situations and demonstrates the importance of the double attack. With instructive examples he proves that double attacks in the broadest sense are the basis of most tactical operations. This discovery prompted Averbakh to focus his attention on the double attack in the first part of the book. The second part is devoted to combinations. The author delves into the question of what lies hidden behind the mysterious concept of harmony of pieces. The astonishing simplicity of the answer he finds to this question enables him to reduce the bulk of the combinations to a handful of basic elements. From this Averbakh derives a convincing definition of the term \\"combination\\" and introduces a new, promising system of classifying different combinations. All this is explained with the aid of numerous practical examples including complete games and chess problems. The book contains special chapters with numerous exercise problems for the reader to test and consolidate his newly-acquired skill. In this way Averbakh's work is both very instructive and easy to understand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GXrMkgEACAAJ&dq=Chess+Tactics+for+Advanced+Players&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yiddish: An Introduction to the Language, Vol. I","description":"Volume two of renowned Yiddish expert teacher, editor, and translator Sheva Zucker's seminal Yiddish textbook series.

Indeed, phrases that capture this notion abound in the popular vernacular: \\"negative energy,\\" \\"dumping,\\" \\"you could cut the tension with a knife.\\" The Transmission of Affect deals with the belief that the emotions and energies of one person or group can be absorbed by or can enter directly into another. The ability to borrow or share states of mind, once historically and culturally assumed, is now pathologized, as Teresa Brennan shows in relation to affective transfer in psychiatric clinics and the prevalence of psychogenic illness in contemporary life. To neglect the mechanism by which affect is transmitted, the author claims, has serious consequences for science and medical research. Brennan's theory of affect is based on constant communication between individuals and their physical and social environments. Her important book details the relationships among affect, energy, and \\"new maladies of the soul,\\" including attention deficit disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, codependency, and fibromyalgia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2yB8AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Health Care Law and Ethics in a Nutshell (2nd Ed) (Nutshell Series)","description":"Medical advances have increased treatment options as well as costs, thus generating many new ethical problems.

With the end of the War on Terror through the accidental launch of new \\"lite'n kleen\\" nukes, a culture of euphoria, ethical and social impairment and calls for numerous peace dividends is again in fashion. This is clearly an environment of business opportunity for financially-bleeding Trotter Pugg Mitchell, a world PR giant, and its clients such as Old Masters Originals, a maker of \\"limited edition\\" reproduction art. And when the agency teams up with Mob Boss Joey Lasagna to abet dicey corporate megamergers, they provide Wall Street raiders with a new quick-fix ultimate severance package: an innovative Corporate Governance Program powered by Trotter's new \\"language of happiness.\\" Cash flow gushes. Money is well laundered. Trotter President Marvin Runnymede sets up a European \\"multi-use facility\\" in a 500-year old chateau in Provence; plans to sell \\"Instant PR Agency\\" franchises to Third World countries, and hires has-been \\"Greats\\" to promote dubious products and ventures. But fortune's smile becomes a sardonic grin. So many stubborn CEOs undergo fatal retirements in colorful circumstances around the world that a powerful US Senator decides to advance his presidential ambitions with the usual TV-circus hearings. Well-cooked dishes of suspicion, buncombe and open doubt are served to the media. In the ensuing rush for strategic exits, winners and losers fake out, promote and wound each other insurprising ways; the faux rond wheels of justice grind and clank, and the \\"language of happiness\\" covers all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lIUftAEACAAJ&dq=ULTIMATE+SEVERANCE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Replicating the real thing: UFOs, photographs, and the burdon of proof.: An article from: Skeptic (Altadena, CA)","description":"The Billy Meier Contact Reports: Book 1This is Book 1 of the long desired series that will eventually contain all of the translated Contact Reports, including corrected versions of the translations done by Wendelle Stevens.

It embraces not just the United Kingdom, but also English-speaking countries linked to Britain by cultural ties of empire and emigration, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. Long regarded as a backwater of sentiment and outmoded academic convention that was bypassed by the mainstream of development in Western art, Victorian painting is now wholeheartedly enjoyed in its own right. Unfettered by old prejudices, Lionel Lambourne presents a vivid panorama of an age of unparalleled energy and creativity. Wealth, optimism, education and self-confidence created a huge demand for art, and a remarkable array of talent emerged to meet it. Producing works in a wide variety of styles, subjects and media, many artists became rich celebrities, while the profession as a whole enjoyed unprecedented public esteem. The author tackles this protean subject by dividing it into themes that reflect its richness and variety. Chapters are devoted to such topics as Mural/ History Painting, the Nude, the Portrait, Sporting Painting, Genre Scenes and Women Painters; and social themes such as the Fallen Woman, Social Realism, Travel and Emigration; as well as movements such as the Pre-Raphaelites. Written with a light touch, full of illuminating anecdotes, and with 600 color illustrations, Victorian Paintingis beautiful, highly entertaining and informative. It is also an invaluable reference work since, in addition to many famous and well-loved images, it presents a wealth of fine work by lesser-known artists, and explores the byways as well as highways of Victorian art, demonstrating the astounding range and depth of talent of the age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_JyDQgAACAAJ&dq=Victorian+painting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signs of Sense : Reading Wittgenstein's Tractatus","description":"This work seeks to shed light on one of the most enigmatic masterpieces of twentieth-century thought.

In 1939, Pavel and Anneliese Bauer are secular Jews whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of Hitler. They are unable to leave the country in time to avoid deportation, but they do manage to get their six-year-old son Pepik a place on a Kindertransport. Meanwhile, a fascinating and compelling present-day strand in the story slowly reveals the unexpected fates of each of the Bauers. Through a series of surprising twists, Pick leads us to ask: What does it mean to cling to identity in the face of persecution? And what are the consequences if you attempt to change your identity? Inspired by the harrowing five-year journey Alison Pick's own grandparents embarked upon from their native Czechoslovakia to Canada during the Second World War, Far to Go is an epic historical novel that traces one family's journey through these tumultuous and traumatic events.

The identification in the National Library of Ireland of three sketchbooks, from which these drawings have been selected, represents a significant addition to the body of early drawings by Mackintosh. The sketches date from a crucial period in the young man's development, spanning his highly successful student years and the beginnings of his professional career. Each of the three sketchbooks covers an area central to his growth as an artist: the architecture of his native Scotland, an important scholarship journey in Italy and, Mackintosh's first love and greatest influence, the study of plants and growing things. Essentially private, these little known and unique works provide privileged access to significant moments in the artist's intellectual and emotional life. In this book Elaine Grogan attempts to take them out of the library display-case and bring them to life in the hands of the reader. She invites us to look over Mackintosh's shoulder on his early tentative steps towards fulfilment as a creative genius.

For an Australian raised on Vegemite, Ireland's black brew is very much an acquired taste. But the travel-writer is committed to acquiring it. Determined to discover exactly what makes a pint of Guinness so legendary, he crosses the Emerald Isle in search of his answers. But in sampling pints as he goes, McHugh soon realizes that in each town, and at every pub, someone always says that the best glass of Guinness is to be found . . . . somewhere else. In his comedic and sentimental journey, McHugh and his companion, Twidkiwodm (the-woman-he-didn't-know-he-would-one-day-marry), hitch around Ireland, meeting unforgettable characters. He goes rowing with a German bagpiper on the lakes of Killarney, windsurfing with a one-armed man in Dingle, survives an encounter with poteen and even finds his own bar . . . but keeps searching for the perfect pint. As entertaining as it is informative, Pint-Sized Ireland is both a hilarious travelogue and thoughtful diary. McHugh's comedic voice swiftly moves in and out of pubs, peering into froth-rimmed pints, and leading readers to question: So does he ever find the perfect pot of black gold? Those who have rested upon the barstools of Ireland, who have sought the famed \\"perfect pint of Guinness,\\" realize that perfection rests in more than just the taste. McHugh captures the visceral experience of Guinness and Ireland in a warm memoir that's perfect to savor. International Praise for Pint-Sized Ireland \\"McHugh's idea of traveling is one continuous pub crawl . . . an entertaining homage to the black brew.\\" ---The Age (Australia) \\"McHugh's writing style is intelligent, quirky, and conversational. The result is a consummately easy to read book, amusing and engaging. It'll make you want to go in search of your own perfect pint.\\" ---Adventure Travel \\"This is a lovely book, well written, full of humorous anecdotes and works both as a travelogue and as a guide to drinking in Ireland. One of the real joys of this book is the way that the author captures the nuances and syntax of the way the people speak ( \\"Rooit\\", said the pub-landlord,  in ye coom\\"'). After a few pages you find yourself falling into this yourself and by the time you finish the book you will have developed a full-blown Irish accent.\\"---www.bootsnall.com","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YT2FAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Their Ancient Glittering Eyes: Remembering Poets and More Poets","description":"A poet recalls his personal encounters with some famous literary figures","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s5cfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Their+Ancient+Glittering+Eyes:+Remembering+Poets+and+More+Poets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Practical Guide to Setting Up Your Tropical Freshwater Aquarium (Tankmasters Series)","description":"Provides information and advice on locating an aquarium for tropical fish, selecting and setting up equipment, growing aquarium plants, and caring for fish.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WlZsZ1A2j4YC&dq=A+Practical+Guide+to+Setting+Up+Your+Tropical+Freshwater+Aquarium+(Tankmasters+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Mary as Seen By the Mystics","description":"In complete harmony with the Gospel story, this book read like a masterfully written novel and conveys the impression that Our Lady's life must have developed just the way this book describe it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kDUMAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Life+of+Mary+as+Seen+By+the+Mystics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Jewish Book of Why","description":"This attractive presentation set of the best selling Books of Why makes an everlasting present.

The rhetoric of standards and vouchers has occupied center stage, polarizing public opinion and affording little room for reflection on the intangible conditions that make for good schools. Trust in Schools engages this debate with a compelling examination of the importance of social relationships in the successful implementation of school reform. Over the course of three years, Bryk and Schneider, together with a diverse team of other researchers and school practitioners, studied reform in twelve Chicago elementary schools. Each school was undergoing extensive reorganization in response to the Chicago School Reform Act of 1988, which called for greater involvement of parents and local community leaders in their neighborhood schools. Drawing on years longitudinal survey and achievement data, as well as in-depth interviews with principals, teachers, parents, and local community leaders, the authors develop a thorough account of how effective social relationships which they term relational trust can serve as a prime resource for school improvement. Using case studies of the network of relationships that make up the school community, Bryk and Schneider examine how the myriad social exchanges that make up daily life in a school community generate, or fail to generate, a successful educational environment. The personal dynamics among teachers, students, and their parents, for example, influence whether students regularly attend school and sustain their efforts in the difficult task of learning. In schools characterized by high relational trust, educators were more likely to experiment with new practices and work together with parents to advance improvements. As a result, these schools were also more likely to demonstrate marked gains in student learning. In contrast, schools with weak trust relations saw virtually no improvement in their reading or mathematics scores. Trust in Schools demonstrates convincingly that the quality of social relationships operating in and around schools is central to their functioning, and strongly predicts positive student outcomes. This book offer insights into how trust can be built and sustained in school communities, and identifies some features of public school systems that can impede such development. Bryk and Schneider show how a broad base of trust across a school community can provide a critical resource as education professional and parents embark on major school reforms.

That is, what was the original \\"good news\\" the first disciples heard from Jesus? What did Jesus really say that started the dramatic movement in Galilee that grew to become the largest religion in the world? Jesus's original gospel has been lost from sight, hidden behind the version preferred by the church. We have put him on a pedestal, rather than walked in his footsteps. In The Gospel of Jesus, James M. Robinson, the preeminent expert on the earliest sources of information about Jesus, provides the primary texts in all their unvarnished honesty to get to the true historical message of Jesus -- what Robinson calls \\"a brittle, upsetting, comforting, challenging gospel.\\" The Gospel of Jesusdraws on a combination of the most ancient and authentic texts to reveal what Jesus really said and to illuminate what he may still have to say to us today. Robinson addresses such provocative questions as: What can we know about Jesus's childhood and youth? What was his family like? What sort of education did he receive? How observant a Jew was he? What do we know about his sex life? What do we know about his relation to Mary Magdalene? What was John the Baptist's impact on him? What message did Jesus really preach? What do we know about his crucifixion? Why did his followers believe so fervently in his resurrection? Drawing on the earliest Gospel, Mark, plus the source for Matthew and Luke, known as \\"Q,\\" as well as from Jewish sources such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the ancient extra-biblical Gnostic texts discovered at Nag Hammadi, Robinson not only reconstructs the good news Jesus preached and practiced two thousand years ago, but shows how relevant his message still is -- and how we can apply it to our lives today. The Gospel of Jesus offers one of the most authentic and stirring accounts ever written of the message preached by the figure whose followers today number more than two billion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=37BAar1rf6wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buried Indians: Digging Up the Past in a Midwestern Town (Wisconsin Land and Life)","description":"In Buried Indians, Laurie Hovell McMillin presents the struggle of her hometown, Trempealeau, Wisconsin, to determine whether platform mounds atop Trempealeau Mountain constitute authentic Indian mounds.

This process involves the exchange of communications between two (or more) participants, and as a result of the exchange, modifications in the personality and behavior of the patient are expected to occur. But what is the nature of the therapeutic messages? How do they produce changes in the patient? What aspects of the messages are important for therapeutic change? And if the therapeutic force is somehow encoded in the messages, where shall we look for it- in sentence structure, in emotional overtones, in gestures and body movements? The Process of Psychotherapy is divided into two major parts, dealing respectively with method and with systems. In Part I, the author presents an analysis of psychotherapy process research from a communications perspective, developing an incisive and detailed analysis of the methodological issues that confront researchers in this field and suggesting theoretical and empirical strategies for addressing these issues. Part II provides the first exhaustive and detailed summary of extant psychotherapy process systems. The author first deals with direct systems, those procedures of content analysis or rating scales that have been developed to assess the exchanges between therapists and patients. Seventeen major direct process systems are presented in detail and are summarized with ample citations to the literature. The final section of the book offers an exhaustive listing and concise description of various indirect measures of psychotherapy process, which do not assess the verbatim interview exchanges of the participants in therapy but rather assess the participants' perceptions via self-report or standard analogue procedures. This book is a basic, sophisticated, and exhaustive coverage of psychotherapy process and content analysis that will become the standard and authoritative source for anyone interested in the process of psychotherapy, whether as student, researcher, or practitioner.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fmVQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems of Jerusalem: A bilingual edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S3QOAAAAYAAJ&dq=Poems+of+Jerusalem:+A+bilingual+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Bird Guide: Northern Cardinal (Wild Bird Guides)","description":"Every aspect of a species' life in the wild -- courtship, nesting, brooding, communication, foraging, flying, fighting -- is covered in text by a leading ornithologist, and photographs by top nature photographers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mwY9HFMWkbsC&dq=Wild+Bird+Guide:+Northern+Cardinal+(Wild+Bird+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parameter Estimation and Inverse Problems (International Geophysics)","description":"Parameter Estimation and Inverse Problems, Third Edition, is structured around a course at New Mexico Tech and is designed to be accessible to typical graduate students in the physical sciences who do not have an extensive mathematical background.

Yet this enigmatic animal is more complex than the legends that surround it. With a shrinking wilderness and global warming, the future of the wolverine is uncertain. The Wolverine Way reveals the natural history of this species and the forces that threaten its future, engagingly told by Douglas Chadwick, who volunteered with the Glacier Wolverine Project. This five-year study in Glacier National Park  which involved dealing with blizzards, grizzlies, sheer mountain walls, and other daily challenges to survival  uncovered key missing information about the wolverine s habitat, social structure and reproduction habits.

It is, without doubt, an issue that has already influenced many international events. Richard Ben Cramer, who has won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Middle East, now presents readers with HOW ISRAEL LOST, a brilliant polemic looking at four key questions that define this conflict and explaining how the policies of Ariel Sharon have ostracised his country in the eyes of the world. Since Israel was founded, the West has seen it as a beacon of hope and democracy amid hostile neighbours. Cramer describes how in the past ten years Israelis seem to have squandered that respect and good will, focusing on the key players and crucial events that have turned the tide against Israel in the eyes of the international community. With the same meticulous research and intelligence that has made Richard Ben Cramer one of America's most highly regarded journalists, HOW ISRAEL LOST is a timely, powerful and important look at one of the most pivotal points of the world -- and in history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5-PUh5eGABAC&dq=How+Israel+Lost:+The+Four+Questions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dolly Hit Me Back!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0LaPLRU4e0C&dq=Dolly+Hit+Me+Back!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mandarin Chinese Dictionary: Chinese-English","description":"This handy Mandarin dictionary allows you to look up words quickly and easily and be understood while speaking.

In Women and Slavery in the French Antilles, 1635--1848, Bernard Moitt argues that gender had a profound effect on the slave plantation system in the French Antilles. He details and analyzes the social condition of enslaved black women in the plantation societies of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), and French Guiana from 1635 to the abolition of slavery in the French colonial empire in 1848. Moitt examines the lives of black women in bondage, evaluates the impact that the slave experience had on them, and assesses the ways in which women reacted to and coped with slavery in the French Caribbean for over two centuries. As males outnumbered females for most of the slavery period and monopolized virtually all of the specialized tasks, the disregard for gender in task allocation meant that females did proportionately more hard labor than did males. In addition to hard work in the fields, women were engaged in gender-specific labor and performed a host of other tasks. Women resisted slavery in the same ways that men did, as well as in ways that gender and allocation of tasks made possible. Moitt casts slave women in dynamic roles previously ignored by historians, thus bringing them out of the shadows of the plantation world into full view, where they belong. Bernard Moitt is Assistant Professor in the History Department at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. Previously, he taught at the University of Toronto and at Utica College of Syracuse University. Educated in Antigua (where he was born), Canada, and the United States, he has written on aspects of francophone African and Caribbean history, with particular emphasis on gender and slavery.

Other works include: The English Orphans; or, A Home in the New World (1855), 'Lena Rivers (1856), Homestead on the Hillside (1856), Meadow Brook (1857), Dora Deane; or, The East India Uncle (1859), Cousin Maude (1860), Rosamond Maude (1860), Darkness and Daylight (1864), Hugh Worthington (1865), Family Pride; or, Purified by Suffering (1867), Ethelyn's Mistake (1869), Edna Browning; or, The Leighton Homestead (1872), West Lawn (1874), Edith Lyle's Secret (1876), Forrest House (1879), Christmas Stories (1885), Bessie's Fortune (1885), Tracy Park (1886), Gretchen (1887), Paul Ralston (1897), The Cromptons (1899) and Bad Hugh (1900). Portraying domestic life in small town and rural settings, she examined gender relationships, as well as those of class and race. She also dealt with slavery and the American Civil War, with a strong sense of moral justice. Her popular work was excluded from most 19th-century literary histories, but she has received recognition and reappraisal since the late 20th century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p8HCjwEACAAJ&dq=The+English+orphans%3B+or,+A+home+in+the+New+world&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ACLS Quick Review","description":"CLS Review Made Incredibly Easy!? gives you the confidence you need to pass the ACLS certification exam as well as the knowledge and skills needed to perform advanced cardiac life support.

Not so, nor was it ever so. Past--and present--tell us that tropical diseases are as American as the heart attack; yellow fever lived happily for centuries in Philadelphia. Malaria liked it fine in Washington, not to mention in the Carolinas where it took right over. The Ebola virus stopped off in Baltimore, and the Mexican pig tapeworm has settled comfortably among orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. This book starts with the little creatures the first American immigrants brought with them on the long walk from Siberia 50,000 years ago. It moves on to all that unwanted baggage that sailed over with the Spanish, French, and the English and killed native Americans in huge numbers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. (The native Americans, it appears, got some revenge by passing syphilis--including Pinta, a feisty strain of syphilis--back to Europe with Columbus's returning sailors.) Nor have the effects of these diseases on people and economics been fully appreciated. Did slavery last so long because Africans were semi-immune to malaria and yellow fever, while Southern whites of all ranks fell in thousands to those diseases? In the final chapters, Robert S. Desowitz takes us through the Good Works of the twentieth century, Kid Rockefeller and the Battling Hookworm, and the rearrival of malaria; and he offers a glimpse into the future with a host of \\"Doomsday bugs\\" and jet-setting viruses that make life, quite literally, a jungle out there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OBnRCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of England: From the invasion of Julius Caesar to the revolution in 1688","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OlYVAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deadlock (V.I.
